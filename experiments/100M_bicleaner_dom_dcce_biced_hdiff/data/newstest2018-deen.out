Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where now for the underground tunnel is dug .
small gar@@ den@@ ers are cultiv@@ ating the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , who had to worry about it , because the car @-@ na@@ i instead of a b@@ ypass road showed a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , a supply of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but topical - but this is precisely why it is very informative .
especially when comparing it with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which one does not recognize as such .
in the large overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ an@@ ium leaves , were incorporated into towns and villages .
these were developed according to the Bavarian sur@@ ve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originates from the first measurement in Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops finally with@@ drew the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV founded the project , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Sur@@ ve@@ ying Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the documentary sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison early / Today is most impressive on the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the drawing up of the map , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings houses are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the insur@@ gency of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , nothing can be seen as fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in , a small @-@ size map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; original &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
today small plots are no longer occupied by farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area stands out north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen we read not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the height &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße people once locked up people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district asylum authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced in his time and ended up killing the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel from applying force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients was first place , and later extended to 500 seats .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the county council in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .
young people meet in the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational facilities .
to the west lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was erected - in architectural an@@ alogy to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during World War II in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as the &quot; main square , &quot; the shopping street called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lied bombs broke up many holes in the city centre .
a big one remained to this day - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages were once located at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the prepar@@ atory work and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn commu@@ ter line .
with the sli@@ der the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
Om@@ bud@@ s@@ man group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ mers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ ameri@@ can travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention when travelling by the state , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents occur recently across the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent law passed by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the state prosec@@ uting agencies that aim dispro@@ portion@@ ately on minorities , prompted the group to release the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group quoted ci@@ dents like rac@@ ist offen@@ ders against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more gasoline at the time of his journey and was put into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report from Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s Office of the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which shows that black mot@@ orists are employed in the state 75 percent more often than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be prepared to bring a deposit or know their relatives to travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fy the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had adopted immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities commit to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project is elementary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ wit@@ n project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have taken a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U village association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted insight into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and also many young animals and houses the holiday palaces in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative market@@ way for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the holiday guests exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also chairman of Fisch@@ bach B@@ L@@ H@@ V , he described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wei@@ tling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t afford to profit on such steep areas .
the green area provides a lot of work and much has to be worked on with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not conduct bio @-@ operation .
for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear that &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the consec@@ ration project and is glad about the leader @-@ promotion . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be removed for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding
a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants in 2013 .
the area of disclosure is therefore 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted by leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
the farmers therefore remained 12,@@ 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and house@@ wives it doesn &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiß asser@@ ts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state subsidies of pasture f@@ ences .
the goal is to keep the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the existence of a conveyor set marked by the L@@ PR .
moreover , the area to be f@@ used must not be pper@@ y ( slope above 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
in 2018 , eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , who would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , are currently underway for the fishing company Wei@@ sh@@ aun@@ ching project in 2018 .
the area of disclosure is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros .
is nothing more holy ?
the White House of Tr@@ ump is now taking the statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully orchest@@ rated overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have as@@ pi@@ red him if he had done it .
but it took on its importance , and in particular the significance attributed to it , as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is really right , but as he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of the shaking words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite some old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your tired , your poor , your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , / the mis@@ erable drop of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable tr@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends , who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic illustration .
Lazarus altered this meaning : in her poem the female figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ antes .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus altered the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great Schrei@@ er R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo@@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not light the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has stum@@ bled on something here .
the importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , poor but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ fic journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and this of course is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognize .
their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the team of Great Britain
the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics track , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship race will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we are trying to understand it , and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy at the corner of the street .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ bills - who will compete against Sir M@@ on Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m course , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s talk was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ s@@ men are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ range runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year had five British and two European records set up .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1.500 metres , is another Scot@@ s@@ man , which was to be watched after a great season , which included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special feature of being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team mates agreed to me and chose me , it makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise to po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it &apos;ll just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate burning voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long before the newspapers hit him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he ino@@ cul@@ ated with criticism , of course .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we will be led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a repub@@ li@@ can governor in an over@@ power@@ ing democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has demonstrated a strong hand in guiding his state and adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very clever to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ port his hair @-@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people that vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the mail talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea either , if a number of people take a position on the same issue , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the govern@@ ors of the governor described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one would have done the same that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical agents and to arrest and silence prot@@ esters .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County last viol@@ ated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable portal had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of papers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters en@@ acted upon his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of am@@ ity , trade and shipping with the UK , prevailed , according to the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
free speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
the former European No@@ .1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led next door at Arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round before losing against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieves his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job as he captured this place .
he is an ard@@ ent advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the programme in the year after I had won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to his home ground .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer through passive smoking
over the past two decades fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 .
back then there have been 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
domestic connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of domestic connections , the location is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
the traffic that continues to obstruc@@ t the construction work is a big problem for the st@@ ump of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists from red traffic lights and shut @-@ off gates is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road was closed and only the buses were allowed to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have been very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the troubled Indones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with d@@ ull water from the nearby shr@@ ub .
a bucket in a non @-@ smoking room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the High@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupation forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal guar@@ dians .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that comprised the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and of corrugated sheets , which have been transformed into various yel@@ low@@ ish brown tones by rust .
only very few In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her light coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a country provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port reduced the value of 3.1 billion US dollars gold and copper .
in addition , Papua related wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military guards a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150@@ ,000 in a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal lands in the 1970 &quot; s have been genocide in line with the Asia Human Rights Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the region alone , Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is stated in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular in a different report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a stream of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim business mig@@ r@@ ors from the densely populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i come .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens are selling roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who moved to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has tasted the native Papua ( the mother @-@ mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ho@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua at the end of his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ho@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , only two months after Jok@@ ho@@ is , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were out and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers fired on their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and struck the group with their rif@@ le @-@ bombs , said sacrifices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young ac@@ adem@@ ics , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - running in a circle running a bir@@ d@@ song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official document of TI@@ ME that was not released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat of danger and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home .
no one was able to listen in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colourful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indones@@ ian only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers only wanted to &quot; back up &quot; their station because they were being attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Danish police commission@@ er Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings was &quot; filtered &quot; after Jak@@ arta the following day .
Jok@@ ho@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura for three weeks in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ uses in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , the Minister of Security , Wi@@ ran@@ to , said he has set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses almost immediately began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occ@@ ured long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be tra@@ vers@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wi@@ ran@@ to accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fi@@ erc@@ ely in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police shot on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ai neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company , who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we &apos;re afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives close to the hospital and witnessed how the injuries were quickly delivered here , such as the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called for the officers to be held ac@@ coun@@ table and to withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a disaster for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green High@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free State Archive &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty is strengthening dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new air routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and wealthy migrants .
Papua have rarely capital or the necessary skills to manage their own companies competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua related institutions due to lack of coordination , even though rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ een , Deputy Secretary of Asia Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ho@@ is &apos;s campaign to raise restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s most rest@@ less provinces of Papua and Western Pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically backed the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , a human right ambassador , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua Islands say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ho@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ho@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Council of the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants Jok@@ ho@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ho@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties resulted in a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second brand that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which one coinci@@ dently calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a villa@@ ger named George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said the fire fighting units extingu@@ ished the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled down the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government said it works on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage occurred from the covering , the exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through the General Meeting with his large Davis Cup coup .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup single , which was revolutionary for this sport , was only to be played on two sets of profits , but thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although they are often very long , but also a highly valued five @-@ set classic , the traditional score remains unchanged .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore scar@@ cely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the applications .
not until the vote , after many in@@ scrip@@ tions , the proposal had already come to fill the final in a neutral place .
new starting in 2018 are only comparatively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and the F@@ ed Cup will have the host right next year in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements regarding training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find out a pol@@ l
a survey among air passengers showed that more than 20 percent intentionally or un@@ consciously banned items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration were smu@@ g@@ gled , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft , while they in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently bore prohibited knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they were mistakenly went with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents saying that they unknow@@ ingly attempted to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent millenni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , who were members of Generation X .
the most common items intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent prof@@ essed to have know@@ ingly carried objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the plane .
the company said it asked travellers around the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods would have brought through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most smu@@ g@@ gled ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA rules are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has hitherto assumed that a part of the customer has withdrawn his non @-@ binding reservation .
besides the increasingly triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la chief El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another , less glorious figure : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun .
Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders , 6@@ 3.000 has already been withdrawn .
critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la is paying the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Form . &quot;
at the moment , 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are available , located in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la leader does not believe that the cancellation of up to now around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be combined - 500@@ ,000 , one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1,@@ 800 reservations per day .
today , who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never before tested production lines without major interrup@@ tions with maximum occup@@ ancy .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are too much delays , the binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s because of dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , rejected his earlier decision to delay implementing the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of harmful air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline that was launched on October 1st for states to comply with the 2015 O@@ zone standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulatory regimes that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ sion regulatory roll back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in earlier administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not adher@@ ed to the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused by activ@@ ist groups and others , and agreed to make an agreement for the implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EP@@ O for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EP@@ O said that P@@ ru@@ itt will at some point use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and all other legally available powers to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month is to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the Senate was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York State At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of States who accused the EP@@ O in this week , said the group intend to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health and environmental prot@@ ectors che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ sion surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to deal with environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery grounds in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16th at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ ficent Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tum@@ lin@@ gens a concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martini under@@ lines : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer primitive customer book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the Berg with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the document according to the document , on the tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent farm belonging to the Church or the right of pat@@ ron@@ age , and not vice versa .
so there were also people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the dominant settlements of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 under@@ pin these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , endow@@ ed it with a pastor , continued to be the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
this was accompanied by the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two died on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be delivered later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops stored close to the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ de cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower could be left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating from the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn to the Hil@@ arius plant .
as organizers , the friends and supporters of Tum@@ arc on Sunday , July 16th , invited to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &apos;s local representative speaks the final word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program begins at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
at the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a drink takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers highlight the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance to Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
friends and supporters of Tum@@ bl@@ ur are particularly committed to the care of home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martini confirmed .
association wants to test approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore appe@@ aled to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bo@@ is@@ heim association has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim niche .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved because at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power @-@ concentration @-@ zone existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion from wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but this had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a mold failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval letter remains un@@ lawful and therefore also to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the town coun@@ cill@@ or decided to re @-@ establish the wind concentration zone in the N@@ ette in Bo@@ is@@ heim ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the division of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been entered in the circle Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle makes it the occasion to test the matter again .
however , they probably do not cause the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning the construction of four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , closed le@@ ases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ sen@@ er households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Kreis Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in a fatal accident .
two more people were easily injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch entered the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of the accompanying driving with her 53 year old mother as a companion .
city and dealer schedule &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
in September Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre .
the business association and the municipal government want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to enti@@ ce residents to stroll in the city centre .
as the chairman of the commercial association , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers for what offers the city &apos;s own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket product .
this means that a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their apprenticeship places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre should invite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the campaign not only targets residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , are Christian König .
the city administration and commercial association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
the commercial association and the city thus go to a further stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre . &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Tag &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers for Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost sight of the inner city while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs .
it was time to cross the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly wi@@ dened , king had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , Head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thür@@ inger cities took part in the nation &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appreciation of local trade and raise its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with its purchasing behaviour can influence its direct surroundings .

Tr@@ ump set out for le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump called for a phone call with Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president rebu@@ ked him because he publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to leave Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and unveiled a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees that emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was conveyed by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for all day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and rum@@ ored to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with rif@@ les to block its path .
the leader of mo@@ bs - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the passengers ho@@ ver in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man shou@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
luckily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a copy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them hit very real si@@ ghs in the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were caught by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organisation of the post @-@ employment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the state Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic surgeon inserts a sheet about the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the free@@ way for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black people of Georgia to vote for the first time in the electoral campaign in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election stab@@ bed a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ ors in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Dor@@ othy with her wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison such as FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they removed from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a mo@@ b mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in mur@@ ders , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and gro@@ unded in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of whom would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and still harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because then we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - came to a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
calf Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of chief @-@ clan member for many years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ne@@ sts scre@@ ams and presses him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a pause .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ cona asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors was wit@@ ching . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship places the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with emphasis .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition stops violent and fast .
there are cries , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman dressed in a trau@@ matic dress stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays singing pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as &apos;s oppres@@ sive moisture for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ sey .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sit in their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears off .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta is chat@@ ting about the night@@ mare with a black pair she has just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which feeling the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called Police sho@@ ot@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks is holding court at his table , eating and remember@@ ing civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emphasis is in a certain way inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans to Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf will focus on a colourful and fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) either shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner including the Wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhein@@ pot@@ terer posed as rock ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or &apos;s guiding principle - money , power and greed - that is moving through his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; staging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three Rhein@@ pot@@ chers - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as well as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
k@@ ess , Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , de@@ compose a corp@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood man@@ ners and give the Kra@@ Wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully nasty Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a weight @-@ weight box .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe in it .
the audience thank@@ ed the ensemble with a strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who are mo@@ dest@@ ly bent and bowed their hands to Merkel @-@ diamonds , are celebrated stor@@ my .
there is a big applause for the Fest@@ spiel@@ haus , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat back in casual leisure clothes .
the performance was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a bell concert with himself , five years later , in which the isolated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went underground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner will be happy about this .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also has grown an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in a cord in the furniture exchange , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school already in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
lot : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late volunteer .
how does that happen ?
amount : I graduated from school .
and then a civil engineer study , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I know for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
do a social year , as there is an insight , you can see how it is on the spot , in the focus , perhaps , really .
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you are doing your FS@@ J .
you can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
for me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
unlike in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it is not a question of calculating st@@ atics .
one repeat@@ ed@@ ely has other people in front of each other , each of whom have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
quantity : I am not the type for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just like that .
Pear@@ son falls further 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is faced with .
the job reduction , which Director General John Fall@@ on predominantly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , is in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 positions .
in May at a third cost reduction programme , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Partner in the past month , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , distributed a statement by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening will happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement says that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the air@@ field of B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had carried out this attack .
on 31 May , massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops re@@ pressed the Tali@@ ban in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and the police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks , Kab@@ ul &apos;s suicide bom@@ b@@ ings have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and , in particular , to the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay the regulation of Obama &apos;s government , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 States accused the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push ahead with the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it showed the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EP@@ O in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to determine where cuts need to be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to rec@@ la@@ im a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the democr@@ ats and conservation groups who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health .
the EP@@ O website says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone &quot; can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma .
municipal council aims at community space
at the end , the decision was clear : at two counter@@ votes , the council of Flu@@ corn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decided to establish a common room in the future residential community .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing piece of land was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take time for the area belonging to the church community to date , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be implemented by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the municipality .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are imag@@ ining that such a community space should not be fores@@ een as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ean living , but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget will be decided by funding opportunities .
the construction is in the area of renovation .
according to T@@ j@@ ades , the establishment of a common space would be able to provide 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed resolution looks to signal the investor that in this respect you do not want to throw a stick between the legs , the finding that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the ambient conditions - as well as a pull @-@ out roof - which reduces the height of the tr@@ ump and makes the building more economical .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried sole does not mean this addition .
if it helps : it is in tune with the body .
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings with which you can &apos;t get so much forward , but now you lean towards the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is necessarily speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy of any already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the area there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real equivalent value which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to raise the resolution accordingly will find three advoc@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with a car : cycl@@ ist is hur@@ led onto the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth and was seriously injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way along the bike path of the Schwar@@ zer road from the direction of Hil@@ den on the bike path of Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer bush .
a passenger car driver heading in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove to the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the opposite traffic .
he met a car which ste@@ ered a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered serious injuries and was brought to a hospital with a return carriage .
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from taking the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund to David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba must let the game be angry at Dortmund .
with personnel care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
in front of the World Cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the personnel worries of the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger at tro@@ phy winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba in the Du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , the mer@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team responsible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play smart , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights enth@@ r@@ alls the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to emerge in the Harz Mountains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association &quot; Observ@@ atory Sankt Andreas &quot; ( Observ@@ atory of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg ) .
there is a Plan@@ etary Trail in Göttingen , since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met the information needs of many of the visitors of the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to place boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quiry came from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
information on the boards should be complemented by the internet .
for this reason , a good mobile network reception will play a role in the selection of locations .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Star@@ path Ticket to Ride will be extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , even though it is considerably far@@ ther away .
I will also inform you in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see .
the association has been running the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 in the village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the university town of Göttingen , there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen ( Planet@@ arium Göttingen ) since 2003 .
starting in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and to the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; Extra Ter@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the plu@@ to @-@ degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away and measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the total distance of the planet is four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were supposed to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting pit fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the hall@@ way to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ Feder@@ ally Champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision about the former four @-@ divisions champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ ma noticed that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got up for Bron@@ es &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight people &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko approved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound dé@@ but this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later openly expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ on Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko gave a generous compli@@ ment to Gar@@ cia and said that he thought the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looked very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could sense the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Lom@@ ach@@ enko : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighter , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injuries to tire plat@@ ters
in an accident on the A@@ 7 four people were seriously injured in the afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the connection to the market .
the passenger car hur@@ led right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ turned and then fell on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; supply chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , hoping for the optimization of defensive compounds in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result , too , would not have been the two ad@@ versaries at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; says Fort@@ una D@@ us@@ sel@@ dorf &apos;s defense player .
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three chain should also be further optimized .
and the For@@ tun@@ as don &apos;t want to catch a goal after a throw @-@ off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is getting better after the experiences in the preparation with the three chain , than with the four chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just in the three chain at the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are able to harmon@@ ize even better and we don &apos;t have so much playing mistakes in the structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I only judged the start into the season after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped early because of a thunder@@ storm .
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might be even a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a climb favor@@ ites in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as much as they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Fort@@ una interior champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland go to the meeting in the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e on Sunday from the Rhin@@ eland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep it away just because we claim to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga which must be hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief Coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results published by the Swedish Asyl@@ um Candi@@ date Evaluation
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Medic@@ inal Medicine ) started to carry out tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should make an assessment of age more precisely after the Swedish Migration Department ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged to be 18 or older , while in more than 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she became 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of human biological maturity in order to see whether they went sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proceeding well .
on Wednesday a concrete section of seven tonnes was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Building and Traffic at the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the works began at the same time on all three sanitary bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is confident that the schedule will be observed .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a bridge bridge made of concrete covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the two other bridges run across Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted bridge cap .
this is a marginal fixing that is also used as a track .
on Friday , a bridge deck of 2.@@ 20 metres is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to be lost .
the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
a special touch of fingers has required the laying of pipes through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ bs first had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collective wei@@ her in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated in a single lane by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the three bridge structure costs amount to EUR 700 000 .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : in protest with german potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the circle of volcan@@ oes ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows peac@@ efully on this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell invites for a &quot; great campaign kick . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the leading duo for the election of the German Bundestag on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot before the beginning of the event will not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ collectors , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was planned at the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking space underneath the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colourful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the Forum A world and one of the decisive organizers , really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could easily eat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel , he dedicated himself to such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n first , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pe is happy that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
looking at the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ u@@ platz he says : &quot; this is the right people &apos;s right , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
it also does : around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the rear seat , in the Stad@@ thalle various or@@ ators , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe boy .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate to vote for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D @-@ event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 9 o &apos;clock .
the police can withdraw - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher trumpet player Freder@@ ic B@@ elli will be present in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ mari@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ er is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combine the desire not only to exceed the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach will listen to the two as in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s world music unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz piano player N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical jazz and free games mix together to form an intri@@ gu@@ ing Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this core of the programme was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram made it especially written for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart quite openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bitter@@ ly .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with each one I have been experiencing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten declared that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed in it .
so it has never confused or im@@ pe@@ de me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never really liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; suffered especially among them in school days , when they preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt under attack , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , they do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to keep yourself in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the general public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tr@@ ump announ@@ cing that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will say to you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised previously a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s democratic candidate .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather stop us from working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 govern@@ ements and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom , and is not able to find a positive , unanim@@ ous message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ NC chair@@ woman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russian athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , that his country &apos;s exile was correct and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes who were cut off gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite its comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 following a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the rigorous IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he told repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council .
funeral ceremony for soldiers falling in Mali
at a funeral service in the North Hessen Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two soldiers were commemor@@ ated by a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
Minister of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the still un@@ solved crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cor@@ on@@ ators of their profession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in western African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the German army in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at mid@@ day only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
roses laid down roses , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the surrounding soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full @-@ swept &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operation of the helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ z@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation did not turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Prime Minister of the yen : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was shared by the royal house on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple are traditionally buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , she said further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to reign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also retired the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ re@@ mahl &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself equal to his wife - even after his death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the owner of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
while his later wife always flew over the sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik expressed his opinion about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was vac@@ ill@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the gau@@ ch@@ ises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and had the reputation in this country to be the brand of social @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
the Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday he spoke for the dissolution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its close one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined their step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants his faction to welcome them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with that , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on the 14th of January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it essential that the day as soon as possible resol@@ ves its self @-@ redemption as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the parliament &apos;s day draws the trust of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be tested legally clean@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ western &apos;s step &quot; but a little kur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return to their Land parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do , of course , assume that she returns her land mandate , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to take any language in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Members of Lower Saxony to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .

the Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from greed , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
the Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp on stamp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder provide the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to all we know , a health hazard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightened by the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has been dis@@ connected without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s dr@@ unk@@ enness .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has just the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are safe and safe for health .
if eggs of the residual value of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg have been exceeded , they are not bu@@ oy@@ ant .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the farms are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , production facilities do not have immediate fault .
on the contrary , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there is too little control in the case of seri@@ ousness .
is it only lacking in personnel or in conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
precisely for this reason , a consistent education of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can be held are of decisive importance .
I have already made clear that I expect a complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular alar@@ ming in food scales really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly considered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the pan@@ eled means manufacturers , traders and consumers are caught up in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food@@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts are dealt with quickly and without gaps .
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not dis@@ rupt N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A mean that eventually PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million $ ) to extract the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in the face of the financing of the team due to the energy rich royal family of Qatar .
associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to counter with legitimate income sources enabling them to even point the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had enormous debt in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and invested strongly to improve the crew and build a global brand - to become a harder proposition .
during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen victim to the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are off excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the proceeds for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most serious sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing was to exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
that was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come through payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be ambassador and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could easily be found .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s will be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly mistaken to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would violate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of La League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Kat@@ ar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finan@@ ces an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Scho@@ g@@ gi@@ supplier
over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board cho@@ col@@ ates for Swiss .
now the sweet collaboration is standing in front of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the contract .
Swiss @-@ speaking spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed that the news agency received a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will complete a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker .
some 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate panels to 14 grams each year distribute the cabin crew before landing to the passengers .
Swiss Life did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders value the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Mig@@ ros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
Swiss Life does not want to disclose how many applicants find it in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are eligible for this .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y plans to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not at@@ tain@@ able for an opinion .
Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights since 2006 .
before signing a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss Life took the opportunity to place the logo , two and a half years ago , with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights the customers of the First Class are spoiled with goo@@ dies from the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class n@@ aschen passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i distri@@ butes Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y on the short track , both in business and in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for talking about lots of vegetables that were spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who grow up - they still managed to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more to the watering can principle , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s , such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that fo@@ ols the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character rum@@ mage through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a successful impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s signature of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now feeling like an old boy .
it is the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could fuel this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I consider to be his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; whose final scene will show the gang , as she will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon reminds one of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its east @-@ east@@ ward w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy made by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , with Rh@@ ys Thomas , is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ tuned Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ uting producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are du@@ b@@ bed in English .
it &apos;s an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
with six long episodes , it moves away , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was edited on a lower length , could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for a feast .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office announced on Friday .
15 accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of the time @-@ consuming ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects of Italy there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian inspec@@ tors were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 police officers were deployed .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organized drug crime , heavy acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office of Kon@@ stanz has been investigating against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the investigations were targeted primarily by Italian citizens with a close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on May 27 at Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
way to complain great gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the ali@@ ens centre register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead to some serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign nationality are reported in the register , among them some 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been adequately well maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data was found in 1921 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data input can significantly slow down processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of paid people , EU citizens are also gr@@ asp@@ ed who would not have to leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false arrangements , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distorted debate on dealing with out@@ going persons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families back to Italy under 16 years of age when they are left there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the paper , &quot; BA@@ MF is leading such proceedings &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , as the newspaper writes in reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has now significantly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) holds these commitments sufficiently .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful detention conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the lack of the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
in a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ ri@@ chen@@ bach the blood don@@ or service was already available to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday .
ahead of all Ju@@ er@@ gen Gre@@ ys , who with his meanwhile 100 donations shared 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the congregation &apos;s meeting , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges its readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is amazing how our bodies are designed for this and we pay tribute to the don@@ ators , who make their blood available for strangers , even more un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the county manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ed are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ent parts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn producers reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K District Manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre has led to higher numbers of atten@@ de@@ es a few years ago .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 years of blood donations .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter spent ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of intensified pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month , as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on fiscal integration would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but they sign@@ aled that in the coming years interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that the bor@@ rowing costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut economic stimulus package published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the finance plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % predicted in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound declined after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound declined by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision for no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened growing expectations on interest rate rise and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast showed little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the sharpen@@ ing is getting worse at first before it gets better .
she added that in the coming years , monetary policy cannot &quot; prevent income from income , &quot; but she added that wages are &quot; clearly &quot; re@@ covering at the end of their three @-@ year forecast .
the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which compens@@ ates for a portion of lower consumer spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the sin@@ king of the pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected to attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the exceed@@ ance in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent return of swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as len@@ ders want to look lou@@ dly to businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closed , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be the controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in the N@@ HS after a fight in front of the High Court in September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ surgery pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National Bank Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to make the registration of people possible and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ disposition pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious areas .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse is to take means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
suitable candidates are identified in clinics , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will cost £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply medicines during this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said , &quot; This great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted specifically on needy and endangered people , offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is actually controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Minister for Shadow Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the completion of the dis@@ semination of HIV in society . &quot;
living a big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced himself from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed her bags and sold them .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make use of the generous cover height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to release the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not only a question of building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to let it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance there are mirr@@ ored units space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , fur@@ nit@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so it is very easy to slide the door when you push the door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar property empire
two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute about one of Victori@@ as &apos;s largest real estate imperi@@ alists worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the 1973 family purchased a store in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co jeans family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in was described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third .
a court document states that this means that Col@@ in owns $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations .
the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but proposes Paul to manage some possessions in a competent way .
in an early case , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter C@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they took advantage of the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ eps store of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property freely to their sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claims Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company .
both Luke and Mark are , &quot; Paul says &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ held very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by sm@@ s to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul chose to su@@ e me and to draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current stri@@ fe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote .
the new Chief of Staff unit plans to limit the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House , which he wanted to fix : poor information that has fallen into the hands of the president .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would obtain good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring their media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump was angry for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reports of places to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former campaign advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; political Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i stated at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know about others - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his staff managed to keep him away for a while , their efforts were worth it .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
Politi@@ co - engaged with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ dile@@ ction of the advis@@ ers to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former pump officials say that tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he is getting to know where they originate from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously gave a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson is permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ane or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations and re@@ vo@@ ke it in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
gold smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tr@@ ump receives . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe send in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are naturally not known , references from the population are hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action following the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience had shown that many volati@@ le destinations were hiding at holiday destinations , called Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online spec@@ s could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to indications of publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire Range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands are once again with some resol@@ ute travellers on the feet of war , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought along horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May , but without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their invasion .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have comp@@ eted the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must indeed be forced through shame to implement , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back .
more came last night , probably today even more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long teachings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council can &apos;t stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inhabit@@ ant who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last lap of these travellers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another lap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible .
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and is to be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof due to the then Ambiente equipment gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the detention of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not without controversy at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Lord Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious potential buyers in the house back then .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building shell containers in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors have been torn out , blankets are partly disman@@ tled , old baths are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still a lot to do .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is resh@@ aped , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nicely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer explo@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
it is not to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer stresses .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms is to be set up broad@@ ly , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable at the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and director of tourism Michael Kr@@ ause have already led him , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s ideas are the same as those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reck@@ ons just under a million euros .
the outside facilities are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace which is open to the public by the restaurant which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Interpre@@ ter sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller was said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury according to a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the panel has taken up the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigation .
the channel CN@@ N reported that there are already first incidents of the Committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump elder son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence agencies have long been using the Krem@@ lin to intervene in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation will focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more Tr@@ ump &apos;s private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the special agent Tr@@ ump personally moved into the centre and under@@ took the alleg@@ ation whether the president might have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary during the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine the evidence in possible break@@ through@@ s and to decide whether a charge is to be prosec@@ uted .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the Indi@@ ct@@ ments .
most of the time they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite persons to participate in E@@ id .
according to CN@@ N , invitations were issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were called upon to make a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. Tr@@ ump &apos;s advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also participated in the conversation .
on Thursday evening , legal experts told us that Mu@@ eller would not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary he would act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
however , the de@@ composition of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the democr@@ ats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but this work also usually works in secret places , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this R@@ ole , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become lou@@ der , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June a sen@@ ate committee , Tr@@ ump ordered him to set up the investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
following depic@@ tion of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and his employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulations on whether or not Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the late President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired upon by the president of the Ministry of Justice .
however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented bills on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed so easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg driving in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ ctic a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the scar@@ cely se@@ ven@@ fold size of Berlin has solved itself from the cup@@ cake .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it has melted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice @-@ gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the rup@@ ture of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research data .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ downs in the region for some 30 years , writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the col@@ os@@ sus broken now was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ tam@@ s so far .
Sch@@ el@@ eb@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it thus continues to grow into the sea and interrup@@ ts regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ tam@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ rupt was dis@@ rupted a few years ago .
a complete sc@@ arf is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ eb@@ oss is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can dis@@ integrate if a piece breaks down at a key point .
melting of melt and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it emerges after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only very little , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s is the fourth biggest che@@ er of Antar@@ cti@@ ca with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural happening and is not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wi@@ dest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he too confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s would grow back or come back in the long run and possibly coinci@@ de , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even if these researchers fail to bring down this gigantic ice ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many of the glaci@@ ers of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart during the last decades .
this long skirt of Antar@@ cti@@ ca extends to South America .
according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the Antar@@ ctic Survey has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med itself around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus count on the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f in personnel
because it becomes more and more difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls on the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the circle day broke out 41 new positions in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle seem to be very popular .
some 6@@ 20 applications had to be received for the places to be published this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still missing staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
there are currently 50 un@@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , the CD@@ U would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the request of the parties , the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future oriented of candidate shor@@ tages , it is said .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself internally and externally , demonstrate concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include an apprenticeship initiative , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you previously did not know .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a down@@ right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .
so it is high time for action so that there are not even more places left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , Group leader of the CD@@ U , still goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he already took care of a bad surprise already in the Reich@@ stag , when he publicly challenged the personnel costs cap and ba@@ ff@@ led the remaining parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nations would like all possibilities to be reviewed , which allow ex@@ iting from the communal employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a ho@@ tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay better for the employees and officials when it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher stage oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees deal with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute @-@ protection law .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor particularly Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs fail to sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came one day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since a year , refused to comment on the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio for extensive alleg@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving lives is our top priority . we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after collecting all the information and ass@@ essing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is thought that its crew carries tu@@ din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are supplied to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Prosecutor &apos;s Act , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ throwing the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a have to have an Italian police officer aboard , who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have so far been willing to stick to the code : save the Children , Malta from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner organization is Mé@@ dec@@ ins sans Fron@@ ti@@ ères ( MS@@ F ) .
in recent weeks , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had decreased sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with the local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; out@@ post of Berlin &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ - und W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always longer climbs , for which long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the popular saus@@ age market .
once again , the view point on the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flying &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of altitude difference was announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , rather than fighting through the stadium ra@@ mps in case of wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ ys included .
these have also recognised the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ eine which are increasingly engaging in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and contracted two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still a number of clubs rising on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London , where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , in particular , that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
at E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup are cont@@ ested at the level of competition .
like in normal sports , the pro@@ s have long established themselves in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a proper sport at all ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it .
even In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bers dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions which can be found in classic sports such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid response capability .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also their body and respect the nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks were difficult to carry out on online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing .
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high Integr@@ ative Eff@@ ect of E @-@ Sports .
players are on the go international , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth of e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is little against the 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors write .
many countries are already on the agenda .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .
e @-@ sport has been introduced as a lesson in a Norwegian school , says F@@ rob@@ bers .
in the Netherlands and in France , the soccer league clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is lag@@ ging behind in the European comparison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Managing Director R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to decay and to clarify the old times is no longer sufficient today .
it is about maintaining the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company with the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; D@@ utt also means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t cling to the fact that only football has everything as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy is pushing for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to commit suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sent@@ encing behind bars and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June due to the neg@@ ligent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and eyes folded down when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they fully regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day in which I do not interc@@ ept the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain that we will bear for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys Si@@ ster , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realisation that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a sponsor for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this only person with whom I have been together since I was born , is a pain that I will always remember for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no Massachusetts law that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , spring up from a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you have to do is turn the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention sought through the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit by some press from the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x who was convic@@ ted of murder of her British co @-@ resident in Italy in 2007 , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as captain in the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern has a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt there .
something else was different on his place in the cab , that saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups was no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made a rush to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after his first assignment as a Bayern @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the one could have run better than at 0 : 2 versus the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i could also interpret the sign of the coach .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , who came from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from holiday .
sugar is prefer@@ enti@@ ally distributed to those with a lot of trust you want to keep in mind .
those who were chosen to leave the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ mich affir@@ med that &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was flash@@ ing over the field as a mini runner .
right behind , this is now his position , the white band@@ age on her arm did the rest .
and at all Kim@@ i worked in this initial formation as the one who can also take the helm in the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ finished tro@@ upe .
he had the view for the whole while many others were occupied with themselves .
Vi@@ dal used to re@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches pointed out to the devil to get out of the achievements of the Asia @-@ trip ( folded up also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus not neg@@ atively tra@@ verse in their first appearance in the Bayern tri@@ cot .
all this worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ ir , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acting sovereign .
the well @-@ sto@@ cked Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times even in the build @-@ up .
his colleague Ru@@ dy said that the result wasn &apos;t as we had hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also brought up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bayern world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in the connection to the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to his new players in the back of his new players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one any more .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises wis@@ ps pace
it has often been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) and Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year when the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand for change in economic policy - and at the same time ad@@ orn the old prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprise ( V@@ TU ) says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to be right .
the West Bank of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country .
the goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Cab@@ inet Secretary Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees this as a sign for supporting regional but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( Chamber of Industry and Commerce ) , like Wis@@ sing , asp@@ ires to develop a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports that has been sack@@ ing for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier offers an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed Master exam and 2500 euros if graduates become independent within ten years of their master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is quick to establish facts , at the same time out of the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Trier .
only 29 places have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing at regional mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U vice @-@ president refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept of how to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the broad@@ band extension in the country is also sober@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies evaluated the supply of grid in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , an ex @-@ minister of business , is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the Wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she cleared the field again after four months because of in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - automotive manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement from Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes cars modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install equipment for the neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases ej@@ ected by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to maintain the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of boo@@ sting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so @-@ called abra@@ ding devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message .
if you visit the Is@@ ar again on Saturday , you will see a raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building paper wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a big info box .
it shows a tr@@ ash mountain .
the launch of a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a worthy wild river is to shar@@ pen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour .
Mor@@ dil@@ los b@@ oll@@ ens and the laughter against the suffering
at times , Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed cartoon characters , the names of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian is still recording and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself , among other things , as a drawer for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his personal data , he still sits at the sign table today , works almost ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks continue to be widely spread worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - who has a jack of thousands as a counterpart .
for the first time , his figures in the 3D film , which will come to the cinema screen in 2019 , speak for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s wei@@ rd for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore he relies more on the TV series , which , as its original drawings , is reproduced without a word .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence under threat from climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which has resulted in much less rainf@@ all in spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either lacking or weakened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .
the little town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 anniversary this year .
the point of fes@@ tivity is this Saturday and Sunday with a middle age .
dealers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ants or a country ski camp are to be experienced during these days in the city centre .
assass@@ ination of a journalist emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly paper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent may@@ hem in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are sufficient .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to joined his office in December 2012 .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said in one of his many books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the 19@@ 30s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez wear t @-@ shirts expos@@ ing his smiling face with spectac@@ les or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special federal prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings linked to drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial .
at Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and even though the terrain is now even more tra@@ itor@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we miss all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez ran the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot at him for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter caught in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as rival fac@@ tions are struggling to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people on the street are shot or that the grav@@ ey@@ ard is full of decorated , two @-@ stor@@ eyed Maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival anti @-@ cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang@@ sters bought each copy of the edition , as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing was seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the intoxic@@ ant problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting studies without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task which you assign as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to cur@@ b like a do@@ er , a friend gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , always sitting at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it smells mis@@ er@@ ably , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the space in which the staff of Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor himself called not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce has written three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known speaker , Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to government spending , concentrating on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group resi@@ ding in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public record that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption .
Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best @-@ informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , which protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists on behalf of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez caught a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs .
journalists all over the country have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a a day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez bl@@ amed the authorities to spy on journalists and persu@@ ade them because they said the truth .
she has since been asked to be re@@ structured by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; Ram@@ i@@ rez said .
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close how the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking will frigh@@ ten him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat at the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all of their phones began to h@@ um .
a series of fights with band ri@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ aped up close - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez glan@@ ced at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think of closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day , where Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ o of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even realize that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they had had something of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persistent fortified din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has ast@@ o@@ unded his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ preserved condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed out of place by the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossi@@ ls discovered by him were sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy oil .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it has been sleeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , though covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ ors over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to explore the animal on information about his life , including his preserved intest@@ ine , in order to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and was prop@@ elled out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at this time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ Flo@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also retained in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just push a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the Earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved fortified din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that were prot@@ ru@@ ding from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater coverage of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house tre@@ sts are still covering b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ resh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as winning the lot@@ tery .
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates that bear the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers spread upwards .
I can count the scales at its sole &apos; .
in the Thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
a heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometres @-@ long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
at the Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) motorway , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the police , around 17.@@ 00 o &apos;clock between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were close to 30 vehicles during a thunder@@ storm , including probably trucks .
there were no indications of the exact number of injured parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , there was a reg@@ u of about ten kilometres .
as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , there was also massive obstruc@@ tions on the back @-@ track - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up an uns@@ we@@ e or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the offer comes , we wi@@ den it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is likely to be available early next year on many more distance routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a rail@@ road spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the railway ticket de@@ valuation without a conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : you get into the train , call his ticket at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic evaluation appears in the test customers .
the train atten@@ de@@ es receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at number Y ticket inspection , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already validated online ticket .
you can continue to sleep , work on , keep in silence .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which is to use the passengers .
&quot; anyone who wants to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train atten@@ dant , checks in the DB Navigator itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to make their journey more personal in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s Marketing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
for many times you have , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents you need to vali@@ date online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card is missing or a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to poor sen@@ timent in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling one &apos;s ticket and taking the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same track are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a stream ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken up to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled by Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police just killed a child of 18 years , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since no one else had posted the information on her feed , she closed fac@@ ebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly rescu@@ ed on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ eten the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed live by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she removed her cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father , who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman told his gun and scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she took off her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from November 11 .
it is a history of survival and of protest , of love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence which consists in the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l , with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation about the black experience and the black condition countless times before this morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on now because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be drawn up therein .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp site when the activists were awaiting the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter have joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , and noticed that she was President of the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came into mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ str@@ e in@@ mates .
his commitment brought the project closer together with six other locals followed by the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so will I be presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah guide , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprisingly individual aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ watch Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the whole movement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held up by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront because life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on disappeared long ago , but the racial lines between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the street three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time yet .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
there is hardly any cold on the subject .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while one says to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery moves more customers into the city , of which also the rest of the shops are benef@@ iting , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then ble@@ eds .
in addition : the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products .
it will end with the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying in the farmer &apos;s market almost weekly for many years .
mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent is due .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should probably not be very low with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s the shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of them in our city .
one can see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important for us to keep at least the market hall .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , shop stores are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies , as the local r@@ ents are often not tra@@ dable for a retailer .
too bad , specialty shops almost no longer exist and that which is still left will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not match Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the peasant market hall going to go back during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .
or does the gh@@ ost bit gallery manage to exp@@ el all the shops from Bit@@ burg earlier ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
and no one needs a shopping center that stands empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to have a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer occupy a place .
when the peasant market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ ft@@ ern and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she publicly set up diplomatic messages on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ it@@ ory and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was changed by Barack Obama , when he only had three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by man@@ ing and from the 30 portraits created , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black and white sel@@ f@@ ie , where Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with whom she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg spoke just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people might look .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while they were in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg on a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use have become un@@ equal pen@@ ni@@ es that exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president would turn the judgment of Chelsea and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually only few days after the book was released , man &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would demand was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually address .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality , and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by including the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de according to the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , how amazing similarly , at least in the biological sense , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome will not take care of who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic book .
it shows Mann@@ ing as it appears with a hands @-@ free phone in hand from the discipline barracks of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they make your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons which assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg about the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed Chelsea like the movement that was behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford due to murder
a nationwide man @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , looking for susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment with deadly injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acts of the Cook County Local Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the scene , and det@@ ectives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , she has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that she was now in absence and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help US investig@@ ative authorities in every conceivable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , stating that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that the building was them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close WA@@ DA driving plan in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the WA@@ DA timet@@ able was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM ann@@ ot@@ ated the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list , however , is that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly subsidi@@ zed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the matter , mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no governmental programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in conversation with the Russian outlet of r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave rise to problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one intends to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia as part of the D@@ oping Sc@@ andal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to Moscow &apos;s headquarters in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA &quot; moved in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ containing anti @-@ lice .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck at your e @-@ commerce startup with your employees , but the poll@@ s did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ ep@@ tive .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been consistency and obj@@ ectivity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap @-@ poll@@ s and poll@@ s of certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low appro@@ vals results - so that you can drill , why .
companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the fin@@ anz@@ tech website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and detect poor behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year in the midst of U@@ ber F@@ ully in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber recently signed up as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ eling allows companies to send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
and when the chief executive is involved , complaints directly go to the supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion has recorded the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ ts , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .
earlier , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as Con@@ ver@@ cent operates , problems that have previously been identified by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed more quickly - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practi@@ c@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group by Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent provide your software as a service and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of firms such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and raised its entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only operations in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are happy to be in a company that heard their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors achieve yields if their portfolio companies are running well . companies are working well when employees are committed and committed .
if the third @-@ party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and commitment , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , disappointment can grow and employees dem@@ oti@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting , said at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have too much reli@@ ed on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow your employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you really listen to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why I should ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it is about 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players on one side of the new practice areas of the team will enter@@ tain on the campus .
some have pulled out their shirts and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the water man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys over the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ din @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was scheduled for Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed timet@@ ables of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the bro@@ ins shifted the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood practi@@ sed practical exercises .
they should hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the control change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on it three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they went on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Fun@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been dischar@@ ged with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective network behind a gate @-@ post , will not be an easy task .
bro@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then sett@@ ling there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts audit in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications to third parties , and then show their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network announced on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and send them to fac@@ tual veri@@ fiers that may display results of the fac@@ tual test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of whom believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly remove hat@@ eful posts like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts check was started .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories from third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to be testing its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creation of a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ ies and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said wi@@ st@@ fully . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story has been illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a dup@@ licate in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell like smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated my welcome pit &quot; ) , it all seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape painters , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it down on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , cards representing what possessed : &quot; one might think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to fight the two families .
guys , let everything go its course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point in order to dive into English history on a broader basis , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al rising in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , which the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid in the English Reformation for seven years .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century is represented , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be a cro@@ ok , always paying off debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their scho@@ oling crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I must be done with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf envel@@ oped
with the v@@ eiling of the 301 @-@ year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honne@@ f launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret to Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a celebration of the Camp@@ aig@@ n on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too nice for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the campaign have been asking the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that we as a bad Honne@@ f citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ five @-@ figure amount for its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so this week too .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the session was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of Government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers , as well as the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs , took part in the discussions .
this resulted in the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army , mostly due to alleged ties to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wi@@ re@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons , who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , has been involved in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
on the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale building in the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan on decre@@ es fired another 7@@ 3@@ 95 state aid , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan was t@@ aming the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier considered the real masters of the country .
three times they called upon their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan re@@ pressed the military &apos;s power step by step , not least with appeal to the European Union &apos;s reform agenda .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan drives specifically to Islam@@ ize the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a named officer warned that after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , NATO could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , according to the pur@@ ges , there is doubt in the Alliance &apos;s readiness for deployment of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration scheme to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump said from the media .
he plans to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft law shall be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers , and will do so by changing the way citizens are spent in other countries of green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for road safety shuttle
over the past few months over the future of the Race Camp sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested again and again - now it is supposed to go very fast .
before the end of the year , the railway line on which the tourist train de@@ parts will be built .
in order to secure the future of the platform sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work on the track will start in this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ e the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country ad@@ mits to this especially for tourism , &quot; said Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the cost of the repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country is 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently finally agreed , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the road@@ side shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the racing stei@@ g shuttle is a rail link popular among tourists between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested to determine whether the route is used by a sufficiently large number of people in order to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also heavily damaged in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , actually .
sex robots are at the moment a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies are delivering a lot of it and we will see them more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern exp@@ u@@ ators have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ per @-@ woman look progres@@ sively .
modern exp@@ u@@ ators have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ end@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , worry a most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy was compared with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is the name of the website .
however , these sex robots aren &apos;t just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their formation and their increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men naturally do not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their rising popularity , they remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture nonetheless .
but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market is allowed to do so .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horri@@ fying aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the failed eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , im@@ itating the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid
tr@@ umps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ er of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US voters have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving in the USA there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of cont@@ emp@@ t relatives .
we all are supposed to ex@@ ert ourselves to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticeable is the power of bringing cord to families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a le@@ ft@@ ward poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone whom she knows , including repub@@ li@@ can kin@@ ship , with which she fought for decades because of politics , is suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is important to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the ex@@ iting effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day its lap@@ ses will no longer be rep@@ elled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even more horri@@ fic long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans &quot; norm@@ alize &quot; the right @-@ wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of ration@@ ality in comparison with its standards .
today I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ in@@ ic version of the fall - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both of which seem to be a very mild off@@ ence in comparison to tr@@ ump .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the kli@@ m@@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Top@@ ic @-@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a big round@@ about in the North of London .
however , the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ el is still a strange magic experience , because here two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ twen@@ ties can go on it and have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually a neutral exchange should be , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic , while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of s@@ lei@@ ghs , which he suffered , according to a case in his cell , to the prison authorities .
upon murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosecutor &apos;s Office said that she would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us men@@ tions that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Flo@@ wery schools , the four @-@ thous@@ anders of Sag@@ itt@@ arius and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the school holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young Eagle that grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from its chi@@ ckens .
instead of chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him was broken ; the eagle stretched out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that , the classes three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank showed a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders wore to make the bet .
the Adler stands for integration , said An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ door worker that he feels accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a word of gratitude to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps back to classes of teaching and the parents &apos; representatives .
the cooking time was over , explained class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she left her students only very reluct@@ antly after two years of teaching , as it was a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , she can rely on the four @-@ meter @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
there was great joy among the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
in the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally camping people was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have intensified the control of the free camp and impose considerable fin@@ es on anyone who is not thought to be in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the Court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to join the action ?
overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission performance of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments .
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have become the Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Railway Authority ( KBA ) ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet been called an exact date .
Daimler reported to write to each person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within its framework .
how long will change@@ over to@@ oling take place altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ met@@ anin thought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers do not act voluntarily in the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group ?
the ace advises to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a risk of massive price deterioration of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE does not fear this .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in the rural area there is currently no loss of value for older diesel .
the ace advises to wait for a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first awards ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the respected .
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series has therefore already announced that he would refuse to attend the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This presi@@ dency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use the talk with Tr@@ ump to make her point of view clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , is going to reti@@ re next year .
the job is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker is the City Buil@@ der for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he con@@ veys in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports about varied but challenging tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has yet provided the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
in this way - taking notice of the regular notice periods - should still be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach acts as the Lower Construction Rights Committee for the Administr@@ ative Committee , the applicant must assign corresponding degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they couldn &apos;t fill it out more , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity to the town is important to the city and to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is confident about the building &apos;s office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen par@@ kl@@ and have been initiated .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , the stadium renovation is still an issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will cost around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design was provided for a city building master of great bac@@ kl@@ ash .
with Has@@ la@@ x &apos;s own building yard and nursery , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .
as the old town stands under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring City Buil@@ der emphasizes .
anyway , the City Buil@@ der bears a lot of responsibility .
he is a client , &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot;
for ten years Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( civil engineering ) has been with us , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to be heir to Roland W@@ acker , according to the city of Has@@ lach , you should have a completed academic degree as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree with the direction of architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction planning and construction planning law .

according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail track crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators run out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night hours .
a pink Roll@@ er- and a bicycle driver were observed near the scene of the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a coup d &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator would have brought himself in great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the rail traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay and the costs for the replacement of rail freight , the perpetr@@ ators of the railway customer could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum was to be assumed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the South Railway route could be managed without any obstruc@@ tions .
just under ten passenger flights were cancelled on Friday morning , two of which were involved in the long haul .
freight trains did not fall , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead power had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
however , a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the affected person is usually advised to ste@@ er meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han helps proteins to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the conduc@@ tive researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues .
if the balance is too far toward inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a type of tolerance induc@@ ing immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han toler@@ ates more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system also works in people .
the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was looking for a kind of immune cell that encourages tolerance , when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but that had not had this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , normally living in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they were given to L. Cross and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria acted on the immune system , the researchers allowed L. Cru@@ ci@@ i to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells fell by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us L. Cru@@ ci@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. Cross can develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. Cross can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho writes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the keeper &apos;s role as people mar@@ ched like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , he had been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and only reached 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ elia Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but insi@@ sted that the club already did a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of his four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such commerci@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new sl@@ ump for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
however , as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still an SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers remained with a certain concern about Berlin before elections .
only no fire from the party centre , but no counter @-@ wind from the League - was the most important desire of the campaig@@ ners .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were failures .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) over@@ threw the unexpected faction exit of a Green Party in a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German business@@ man Michael Kell@@ ner sum@@ mon@@ ed the apo@@ state @-@ minded Dutch green @-@ minded German MEP , El@@ ke T@@ westen , to give back their mandate .
the transfer to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German managing director and campaign leader of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message has reached the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the surrender of the green dep@@ u@@ ties , Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more than that , cal@@ med down the comrades at the time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it then became - and indeed everything got much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the do@@ ve , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly .
the comrades rose lab@@ ori@@ ously in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just plu@@ cked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ Summit of Hamburg came .
and the next hit came with him .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD landed in the SPD , lost his aura on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town burned .
and because in crisis communication he got so much wrong about what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhaust @-@ gas affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time now .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps because of this , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the wa@@ ist@@ band over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not concealed , even in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him be granted , as they promised from Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is at the bottom of no fault in the party internal co@@ er@@ cion of the Lower Saxony .
and Martin wasn &apos;t at all .
for the time being , comrades , comrades , make an effort to keep their own ranks closed .
her anger appe@@ aled to the Gre@@ ens , and here especially to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ anism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic as Mrs. T@@ westen combined their own career perspectives on the interests of everyone else , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate , but has been elected to parliament via the state list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens , according to the Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the choice of voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who heads the Lower Saxony Social Democratic Party as a leading candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for the explanation of the background .
I want to know if there have been more or further commitments by the CD@@ U Lower Saxony have been given .
funding for town III
those who want to renov@@ ate their aged house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development informed us about this on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a look back on what happened to date .
since 1991 , there have been areas of san@@ itation .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the re@@ development area II between 2005 and 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous restructuring is a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the development of the interior and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , I received the information from the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe that there will be a remedi@@ ation area III .
the total funding amount was € 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 , of which 500 000 Euros would be from the country , the rest of the congregation sensi@@ gen .
how does an area of renovation work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate , so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could be postpon@@ ed again .
the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal State Program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and developing the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per plot .
the re@@ development area would then finally be set as a statute .
the grant period for the funding will continue until April 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September of this year , the survey would only be carried out in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation field to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , as soon as possible , the statute of proposition should be carried out , so that in the coming year it can be started with the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann later declared that every Commune had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .
the aim is to assess and decide the conditions of urban planning , when it is renovated and to what extent .
there will be a remedi@@ ation note in the land register for each piece of land .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to his senses and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ tw@@ ald emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which deals with the structural condition and remedi@@ ation views among other things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing Estate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information on size , division and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blue &quot; arc &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building .
however , it should be noted that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new building measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphas@@ ised that the distribution of the subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; function - first of all , grin@@ ds first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could not reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Orts@@ kern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the participants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ing an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedures are carried out according to medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built in both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to bring a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the data of the military entrusted to the TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence , and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the Connec@@ ti@@ cut helicopter was issued alongside a Ma@@ ine yacht , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire truck and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office demanded the presence of helicopter in a question@@ able order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the meeting of his superi@@ ors , the deputy commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on July 17th for the event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
during the event , the original aircraft crew was at the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the floor during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a breach of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon due to politically advantageous aims .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but demanding their use only for a photo op is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet served in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential jet through its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently conduct training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end U.S. president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers sets .
when Tr@@ ump was in Germany at the G@@ 20 summit in early July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Si@@ kor@@ ski said that the company was not involved in providing the helicopter to the South La@@ wn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the Pres@@ i@@ dency flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Secretary of Defense of the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
record records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for the re@@ valuation principles is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter &apos;s use for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task

at any rate , Team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in a similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imports from the high north are mainly responsible for class and stability at the S@@ V .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bets in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north stands handy .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress gave a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft intends to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the O@@ MV , who jointly with other European companies co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea tung Nord Stream 2 , are accordingly worried .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dro@@ pl@@ ets are huge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation .
Donald Tr@@ ump , in fact , would have to raise the sanctions themselves by an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at what the group could defend and what could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not been over yet .
the season three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bu@@ cks of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has focused its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; only with more state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican alliance , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .

roll backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table by itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens ( Kit@@ as ) back into self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cook continues to be cooked out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked ch@@ illed .
the city runs 46 day@@ care centres in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last year of the kit@@ esur@@ fing , 2,@@ 800 children each sat at the tables , and the demand grows constantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 days of the week are accommodated in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff have kitchen service from 1 September : they heat the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruits , divide the meal individually , give the food out , clean , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as si@@ eving equipment - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly size .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ ich said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that it has issued in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign award for the city as the most economical one , is called the Press Office .
and this even though 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong for about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ pres@@ idents and over 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the choice process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Tali@@ ban has released threats against an election process that coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year , elections for the first time will be handed over to the next government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by registered 3,@@ 6 million voters .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police information , the men spoke to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who was staying with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2 : 55 p.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request , but continued with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which however failed .
the duo fled without prey .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a trade union wants to wi@@ den its long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glas@@ gow with managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the plant , producing hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits next to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
in a letter to the branch manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call on &quot; say concerns that funding for modernis@@ ing production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Glas@@ gow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic back of production , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow is urgently needed a flour@@ ishing presence in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to this because we value continuous engagement with employees and union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are constantly monitoring our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our mot@@ o@@ cross country , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production fully and fully . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may be of interest to Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar in its persecution after giving up an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the World Record ?
the sensational approach announced the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after the termination , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP a week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way out , although a spring near the Catalan board insi@@ sts that the club always did his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the soccer world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , it will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , while the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael H@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche &quot; ( &quot; Wir sind Kirche &quot; ) , announced after publication with the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Cathedral Choir Master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would greatly serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the events at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were measured when reporting on violence in the cathedral scra@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the ass@@ aults in Regensburg no one doub@@ ted that it was a &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful act &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , such as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis , too , said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a bound meal . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows was a normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s bench@@ marks to earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael H@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a of &quot; My Brother the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ sia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the findings of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , who was commissioned by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were subjected to &quot; high plau@@ sibility &quot; between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plau@@ sibility , &quot; 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can be said that , in many cases , domain masters have been used for physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotional appeal the punishment for the students was even more severe .
in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , however , many victims have noticed that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even had positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
in the interview , H@@ esh@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence Against Gu@@ ards at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of the Cathedral Choir Master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students emphas@@ ise his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who has been tangible to the gre@@ ener when a domain record musi@@ cally produced no top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael H@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all in it .
just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of ac@@ compli@@ ce or co @-@ operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of his sphere of activity .
you can at best disc@@ ard it , experience it too late or have not taken the first hints seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived as literally &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes it as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes from children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotional appeal , which also led to out@@ breaks .
the fact that he did not only pop with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also par@@ ted ear @-@ cow@@ ards and attracted too nau@@ ghty boys to the hair or ears , he already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his honour , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the period of the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers .
do you know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state Gymnasium .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the violent exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school , these are indeed Bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders whether it is not more about his fame and role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rush@@ ed on him .
many who have never understood him are still working eag@@ erly at the Bavarian Pope .
the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , in connection with the report , a lot was reported on the subject of abuse during the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger be charged any involvement or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael hes@@ aman : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have trusted the domain master .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about this with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even confi@@ de in their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who , in a professional way , would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael H@@ emann : a question@@ able student said : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... even for really absurd to assume that it was imp@@ uted to him ... boys intru@@ sive or clearer or even more likely to have opened than to their parents , boarding leaders , trust@@ ee teachers , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report concludes with a very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected in advance could not be confirmed as part of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to talk about any co @-@ operation .
it cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these vile crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Weg@@ look &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael H@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in the coverage everything mixed and mixed up became a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
because it is clean@@ ly separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence as well as , let &apos;s say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report treats incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole terrible pru@@ dence pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were really har@@ assed and portra@@ yed and suffered , were all at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have prevailed .
but with them Cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the dome gymn@@ asi@@ um .
on the one hand , as most of the witnesses pointed out , the topic &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael H@@ emann : there was discipline , but not sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even had positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most , the reproach is not to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish himself and from operations at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again at the end of 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently lose his ears in front of the states ?
Michael H@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report was even re@@ producing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended an urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity persi@@ sted when Prü@@ fer pun@@ ishments were banned in Bavaria for a long time .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows well .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the people affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that just doesn &apos;t work .
it was only in 1980 that the Prü@@ fer penalty was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis states that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael hes@@ aman : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ apping of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , the risk of evaluating past and present moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess was right .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was too abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what has been viol@@ ated in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am happy that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time I have to take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so tear@@ ing the ear and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , it kept strictly adher@@ ed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regensburg time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of Prü@@ fer rebu@@ ke also in the language ?
Michael H@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , that the dom@@ et@@ le spar@@ rows played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I am not at all ashamed that he had a strict regi@@ ment there .
but that also has to be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , one does not once again make a great singer and before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael hes@@ aman : through the work on the book and beyond that , I have met George R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experiences again and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , ben@@ evol@@ ent , deep @-@ minded and heart @-@ loving person , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something for a fly too .
I regularly get into contact with him , as many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him , read him , he is almost blind and treat him like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
today , most of the dom@@ et@@ les are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing the world of music to them .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect for respect , to which they still look at and worship them .
and please , once again clearly : all that is proposed to him are methods of education that were on the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have long over@@ came this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is only too obvious the evil intent behind it .
for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him .
now the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has gained great mer@@ its and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , would finally be in peace .
