<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where now for the underground tunnel is dug.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners are cultivating the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, who had to worry about it, because the car-nai instead of a bypass road showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, a supply of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but topical - but this is precisely why it is very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing it with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickenteppich, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called uranium leaves, were incorporated into towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and originates from the first measurement in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops finally withdrew the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801: today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV founded the project, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The documentary sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / Today is most impressive on the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the drawing up of the map, i.e. in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Untersendlings houses are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, nothing can be seen as fields - at first sight: when zooming in, a small-size map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered pieces from the so-called "original" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today small plots are no longer occupied by farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen we read not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the height "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße people once locked up people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district asylum authority" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created there." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced in his time and ended up killing the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel from applying force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, and later extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the county council in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in the area of the former Auer Anstalt in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was erected - in architectural analogy to the origin of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II in bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as the "main square," the shopping street called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allied bombs broke up many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages were once located at the Marienhof, where these days were the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn commuter line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "the National Association for the Promotion of Farmers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will come into force by August 28, 2017, calls on afro-american travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention when travelling by the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur recently across the country," "" "states the Group's opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law passed by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to accuse discrimination, as well as the state prosecuting agencies that aim disproportionately on minorities, prompted the group to release the warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "" "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted cidents like racist offenders against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline at the time of his journey and was put into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report from Missouri's Office of the Office of Missouri, which shows that black motorists are employed in the state 75 percent more often than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware of what might happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be prepared to bring a deposit or know their relatives to travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI, which classify the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had adopted immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities commit to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">"" "the" "" "soft" "" "project is elementary." ""</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidewitn project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU village association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted insight into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and also many young animals and houses the holiday palaces in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "is the alternative marketway for the milk of his cows," "" "says Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the holiday guests exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also chairman of Fischbach BLHV, he described the" "" "elementary importance" "" "of the" "" "Weitling" "" "project." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't afford to profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area provides a lot of work and much has to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not conduct bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear that "the Commune has recognized the importance of the consecration project and is glad about the leader-promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the areas could be removed for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operations," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be forested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted by leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">The farmers therefore remained 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac said:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and housewives it doesn't work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiß asserts:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state subsidies of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to keep the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the existence of a conveyor set marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the area to be fused must not be ppery (slope above 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">In 2018, eight participants with 24 parcels, who would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, are currently underway for the fishing company Weishaunching project in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of disclosure is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">The White House of Trump is now taking the statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have aspired him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took on its importance, and in particular the significance attributed to it, as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta complained," "" "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is really right, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of the shaking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your tired, your poor, your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely, / the miserable drop of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable trash" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends, who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus altered this meaning: in her poem the female figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exilantes.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus altered the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservatives that bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not light the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual, Limbaugh has stumbled on something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, poor but hopeful people after long and often horrific journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this of course is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butbills - who will compete against Sir Mon Farah on the 5,000 m course, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "their captain's talk was incredible," "" "says Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"" "" "" "a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated." ""</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scotsmen are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-range runner Muir leads along this path and last year had five British and two European records set up.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 metres, is another Scotsman, which was to be watched after a great season, which included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "hugely proud" of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special feature of being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team mates agreed to me and chose me, it makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate burning voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long before the newspapers hit him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He inoculated with criticism, of course.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we will be led like sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overpowering democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has demonstrated a strong hand in guiding his state and adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very clever to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to deport his hair-less head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people that vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other news," "" "she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I do not appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same issue, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the governors of the governor described as" "" "concentrated spam-attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one would have done the same that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical agents and to arrest and silence protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County last violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portal had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of papers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters enacted upon his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticized his position on the treaty of amity, trade and shipping with the UK, prevailed, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>

<seg id="368">"there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most restless provinces of Papua and Western Papua: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation.</seg>

<seg id="423">Besides the increasingly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla chief Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed another, less glorious figure: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="425">Musk admits: from the total of 518,000 orders, 63.000 has already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla is paying the 1000 Euro (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "Reservation Form."</seg>
<seg id="428">At the moment, 45,000 such non-binding reservations are available, located in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla leader does not believe that the cancellation of up to now around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be combined - 500,000, one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are 1,800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Today, who orders a "Model 3" can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand new, never before tested production lines without major interruptions with maximum occupancy.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, rejected his earlier decision to delay implementing the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of harmful air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is about a deadline that was launched on October 1st for states to comply with the 2015 Ozone standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the observance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hampering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump Attorney of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulatory regimes that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Prusion regulatory roll back agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "in earlier administrations, the EPA has often not adhered to the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused by activist groups and others, and agreed to make an agreement for the implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who accused the EPO for more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also take the law and authority that gives us serious." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">"" "nevertheless, the opinion of the EPO said that Pruitt will at some point use his" "" "authority to delay" "" "and all other legally available powers to ensure that the rules" "" "are based on a solid policy and the best available information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive reconstitution of ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A draft law approved last month is to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16th at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Beneficent Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tumlingens a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini underlines:" "" "it is a unique village treasure." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer primitive customer book: count Hermann von Sulz sold the Berg with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document according to the document, on the tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent farm belonging to the Church or the right of patronage, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the dominant settlements of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 underpin these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, endowed it with a pastor, continued to be the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was accompanied by the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two died on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops stored close to the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilde cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower could be left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm split the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating from the "Schaffhausen pensioners" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn to the Hilarius plant.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, the friends and supporters of Tumarc on Sunday, July 16th, invited to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "Hartmut Romann's local representative speaks the final word." ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The program begins at 4.30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "Boisheim resists" "" "does not see a legal precondition for the construction and has therefore appealed to the Councillor." ""</seg>
<seg id="506">The Boisheim association has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim niche.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved because at the time in Viersen only at the border of Schwalmtal a wind power-concentration-zone existed.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion from wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones should prevent" "" "austerity" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier in the Boisheimer Nette - but this had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a mold failure.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval letter remains unlawful and therefore also to take back," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" Boisheim "" "." "" "</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle makes it the occasion to test the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they probably do not cause the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning the construction of four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, closed leases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-sener households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersens gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in Kreis Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="682">They work in several places in their volunteer year.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: normally in a cord in the furniture exchange, once a week I help in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school already in the open whole day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Lot: it's a beautiful, wide spectrum I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a late volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that happen?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I graduated from school.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineer study, let's say, successfully broken off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I know for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else, work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what do you do.</seg>
<seg id="695">Do a social year, as there is an insight, you can see how it is on the spot, in the focus, perhaps, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it like that?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study dual, probably in Jugendamt Herne a social worker training and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.</seg>
<seg id="700">Is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the volunteer service?</seg>

<seg id="702">It always depends on where you are doing your FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">For me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.</seg>
<seg id="708">Unlike in civil engineering studies?</seg>
<seg id="709">Quantity: well, here it is not a question of calculating statics.</seg>
<seg id="710">One repeatedely has other people in front of each other, each of whom have a completely different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a teenager, who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you didn't have any reservations?</seg>

<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday a concrete section of seven tonnes was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it's going great," "" "said Reinhold Leicht, Head of Building and Traffic at the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April the works began at the same time on all three sanitary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is confident that the schedule will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a bridge bridge made of concrete covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges run across Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons weighted bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a marginal fixing that is also used as a track.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a bridge deck of 2.20 metres is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to be lost.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent by the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special touch of fingers has required the laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable, to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crabs first had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard building and the collective weiher in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated in a single lane by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach village entrance the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully closed.</seg>
<seg id="929">The three bridge structure costs amount to EUR 700 000.</seg>

<seg id="948">There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate to vote for the parliamentary elections, Alice Weidel, and vice-president Beatrix of Storch their speeches.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEFA mean that eventually PSG has to prove that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to extract the Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in the face of the financing of the team due to the energy rich royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to counter with legitimate income sources enabling them to even point the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had enormous debt in their pursuit of success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and invested strongly to improve the crew and build a global brand - to become a harder proposition.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen victim to the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare off excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely, FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the proceeds for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most serious sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of €60 million (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsoring was to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">That was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsoring of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments of the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar World Cup will be ambassador and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could easily be found.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, announcing on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars will be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly mistaken to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars away by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Katar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living a big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold them.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make use of the generous cover height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to release the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not only a question of building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there are mirrored units space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a little engineering art went in," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, furnitered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is very important, so it is very easy to slide the door when you push the door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar property empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute about one of Victorias's largest real estate imperialists worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the 1973 family purchased a store in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with her late father, Colin was described by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court document states that this means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but proposes Paul to manage some possessions in a competent way.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early case, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Ceck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeeps store of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of High School when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property freely to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, whereby Colin claims Mark has paid $10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Both Luke and Mark are, "Paul says" about the conditions of their financial separation. "</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin withheld very much, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin responded by sms to say," "" "I really can't say much," "" "because the case was before the courts." ""</seg>
<seg id="1383">"" "" "" "it is very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and to draw our surname through the courts," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">The new Chief of Staff unit plans to limit the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to fix: poor information that has fallen into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would obtain good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring their media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Trump was angry for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reports of places to convince," "" "said the former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "political Tara Palmeri stated at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed to keep him away for a while, their efforts were worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - engaged with this story - reported in May about the predilection of the advisers to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former pump officials say that trump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he is getting to know where they originate from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">That is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson is permanently banned from Twitter for chicane or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations and revoke it in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold smith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the detention of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not without controversy at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadts Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious potential buyers in the house back then.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special promoter Robert Mueller was said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury according to a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in recent weeks, the panel has taken up the work, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "calling on people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The channel CNN reported that there are already first incidents of the Committee in connection with a meeting between Trump elder son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence agencies have long been using the Kremlin to intervene in the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also examined more and more Trump's private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote several weeks ago that the special agent Trump personally moved into the centre and undertook the allegation whether the president might have obstructed the judiciary during the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence in possible breakthroughs and to decide whether a charge is to be prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the Indictments.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite persons to participate in Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, invitations were issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were called upon to make a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. Trump's advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his manager Paul Manafort also participated in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">On Thursday evening, legal experts told us that Mueller would not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary he would act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the decomposition of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the theme gives the democrats an opportunity to" "" "feel good, because they have nothing else they can talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this work also usually works in secret places, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any measures which accelerated the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "the former FBI boss James Comey said three times that not against the president." ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this Role, accusations against Trump had become louder, he wanted to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June a senate committee, Trump ordered him to set up the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Following depiction of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculations on whether or not Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair around the late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired upon by the president of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1527">The colossus broken now was a part of the Larsen-C-Scheltams so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelebs floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It thus continues to grow into the sea and interrupts regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Scheltams lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe, the balance of waxing and abrupt was disrupted a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete scarf is broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Scheleboss is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stands under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of melt and iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it emerges after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only very little, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelhos is the fourth biggest cheer of Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural happening and is not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the widest retreat since the beginning of the record," "" "he too confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C-Schelcows would grow back or come back in the long run and possibly coincide, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers fail to bring down this gigantic ice iceberg to climate change, many of the glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart during the last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends to South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Survey has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed itself around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus count on the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif in personnel</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes more and more difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU calls on the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the circle day broke out 41 new positions in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the circle seem to be very popular.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 applications had to be received for the places to be published this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle is still missing staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">There are currently 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Together with the FDP and the UWG, the CDU would like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the request of the parties, the administration should" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to meet not only short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the future oriented of candidate shortages, it is said.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orient itself internally and externally, demonstrate concrete measures for cross-entrants and include an apprenticeship initiative, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you previously did not know.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a downright" "" "competition of the public employers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So it is high time for action so that there are not even more places left unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, Group leader of the CDU, still goes beyond the joint application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He already took care of a bad surprise already in the Reichstag, when he publicly challenged the personnel costs cap and baffled the remaining parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "nations would like all possibilities to be reviewed, which allow exiting from the communal employers" "" "association." ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we don't come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in co-operation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a hotariff," "" "said peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to pay better for the employees and officials when it actually foresees the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher stage oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees deal with the provisions of the new prostitute-protection law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor particularly Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they must not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs fail to sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," "" "said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German aid organization 'Youth Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation since a year, refused to comment on the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio for extensive allegations.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving lives is our top priority. we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on social media." ""</seg>

<seg id="1586">"" "the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from" "" "Youth Rettet" "", "the Iuventa, since October." ""</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew carries tudinghy migrants aboard, which are supplied to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Prosecutor's Act, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overthrowing the authority of the Italian coast guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa have to have an Italian police officer aboard, who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have so far been willing to stick to the code: save the Children, Malta from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring any" "" "essential changes or disabilities" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner organization is Médecins sans Frontières (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">In recent weeks, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had decreased sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with the local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries hoping to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Biker, the "outpost of Berlin" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region to enjoy trials and sightseeings for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burg- und Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the popular sausage market.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles, rather than fighting through the stadium ramps in case of wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gays included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognised the first Bundesligavereine which are increasingly engaging in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.</seg>

<seg id="1619">Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup organised the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where gamers from different clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds, in particular, that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal government to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">At E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA World Cup are contested at the level of competition.</seg>
<seg id="1628">Like in normal sports, the pros have long established themselves in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a proper sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to it.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Even Ingo Frobbers dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions which can be found in classic sports such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response capability.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console, but also their body and respect the nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"" "" "" "the fit player is a good player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "but Frobbing also sees problems:" "" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1639">The scientists emphasise the high Integrative Effect of E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are on the go international, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">"" "" "" "this is little against the 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga." ""</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the e-sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "the Deloitte advisors write.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already on the agenda.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers to install equipment for the neutralisation of exhaust gases ejected by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price of the cars competitive.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "his message: laughter," "" "For there is too much sorrow in the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he proposed himself, among other things, as a drawer for greetings cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in Paris Match, and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect-borne insects, which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years, which has resulted in much less rainfall in spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small zikade, a microbacterium that transmits the dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are very many of it." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1809">Assassination of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly paper Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent mayhem in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto joined his office in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez said in one of his many books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodolce building. two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear t-shirts exposing his smiling face with spectacles or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of killings linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodolce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconspicuous and even though the terrain is now even more traitorous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we miss all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez ran the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot at him for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter caught in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people on the street are shot or that the graveyard is full of decorated, two-storeyed Mausoleums for drug kings that are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival anti-cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have annoyed the sons, suspected gangsters bought each copy of the edition, as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing was seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the intoxicant problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trade in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodolce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curb like a doer, a friend generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, always sitting at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for the routine his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells miserably, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the trouble is, the editor of the Riodolce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space in which the staff of Riodolce met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself called not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodolce has written three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known speaker, Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to government spending, concentrating on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group residing in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public record that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled nearly the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had considered the best-informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "earlier we had known what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El Flaco" "" "because of his slender body." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, which protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists on behalf of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists all over the country have become louder by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa a day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez blamed the authorities to spy on journalists and persuade them because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since been asked to be restructured by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials and a valid society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "last year, the media group" "" "Articulo 19" "" "assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by Zetas-Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones lay beside her separate head.</seg>

<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of place by the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossils discovered by him were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy oil.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you only blinking a little with your eyes, you might almost believe it has been sleeping," "" "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this herbivorous, though covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armors over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period must have been," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs crossed the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-preserved fortified dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that were protruding from his shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly rescued on their timeline.</seg>

<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11 o'clock, she took off her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from November 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and of protest, of love and loss, strength and resilience which consists in the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell, with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown, went to Ferguson, the two had a conversation about the black experience and the black condition countless times before this morning.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp site when the activists were awaiting the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter have joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>

<seg id="2060">"" "a question came into mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestre inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought the project closer together with six other locals followed by the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferris's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah guide, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result documents of "Whose Streets" show surprisingly individual aspects of Ferris's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>

<seg id="2071">Furthermore, Ferris's history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "Blackwatch Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they haven't been built for a long time yet.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone splits the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">There is hardly any cold on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While one says to the bit gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "does not need a human being" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery moves more customers into the city, of which also the rest of the shops are benefiting, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then bleeds.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition: the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds on which the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">It will end with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been buying in the farmer's market almost weekly for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women always happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of rent is due.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "but this should probably not be very low with the new project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's the shopping list in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think this is superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important for us to keep at least the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop stores are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies, as the local rents are often not tradable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, specialty shops almost no longer exist and that which is still left will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not match Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the peasant market hall going to go back during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to expel all the shops from Bitburg earlier? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And no one needs a shopping center that stands empty.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to have a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no longer occupy a place.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuftern and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after she publicly set up diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming resemblance (a matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transitory and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was changed by Barack Obama, when he only had three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created through algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by maning and from the 30 portraits created, as someone with these genomic data could look, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie, where Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with whom she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg spoke just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while they were in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg on a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse have become unequal pennies that exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would turn the judgment of Chelsea and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually only few days after the book was released, man's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would demand was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually address.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation was gender, race, sexuality, and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how amazing similarly, at least in the biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome will not take care of who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic book.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as it appears with a hands-free phone in hand from the discipline barracks of the United States like King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacons which assemble like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck at your e-commerce startup with your employees, but the polls did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>

<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, provide special groups and demographic groups, provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-polls and polls of certain teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approvals results - so that you can drill, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won't be the next Uber that has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the finanztech website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and detect poor behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year in the midst of Uber Fully in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convereling allows companies to send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive is involved, complaints directly go to the supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the Court of Public Opinion has recorded the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotts, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, Convercent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have an easy way to reach their headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a timidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as Convercent operates, problems that have previously been identified by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed more quickly - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practicality.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group by Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>

<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>

<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent provide your software as a service and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the entire capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">High salaries and interesting projects are only operations in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "when people are happy to be in a company that heard their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and GLINT."

<seg id="2243">Investors achieve yields if their portfolio companies are running well. companies are working well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and commitment, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, disappointment can grow and employees demotiate.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks," "" "Russell Raath, President of Consulting, said at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have too much relied on collecting data." ""</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into the employees, and hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-ies and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape painters, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "Whiskey" "" "and started writing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it down on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empires, cards representing what possessed: "one might think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch in order to fight the two families.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point in order to dive into English history on a broader basis, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "" "" "there is a record of an upheaval rising in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," "" "Rhodes says." ""</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is represented, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was dug out).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be a crook, always paying off debts and spending money on things they could not afford.</seg>

<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for road safety shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Over the past few months over the future of the Race Camp shuttles has been contested again and again - now it is supposed to go very fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Before the end of the year, the railway line on which the tourist train departs will be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the platform shuttles in the long term, construction work on the track will start in this year according to the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and sane the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country admits to this especially for tourism," said Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The cost of the repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Of this sum, the country is 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country, is currently finally agreed, explained Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are at the moment a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of it and we will see them more often," "" "said Mr. Sharkey at the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern expuators have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adjust" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepper-woman look progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern expuators have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," enthuses the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be on conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (is here: reluctant) Farrah, worry a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy was compared with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is the name of the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots aren't just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men naturally do not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain on the brink of consumer culture nonetheless.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market is allowed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrifying aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the intricate body and the failed eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, imitating the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps big performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney as the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truer of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving in the USA there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of contempt relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all are supposed to exert ourselves to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticeable is the power of bringing cord to families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftward poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone whom she knows, including republican kinship, with which she fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is important to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the exiting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "trump" "", "we refer to the creepy possibility that one day its lapses will no longer be repelled." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump republicans "normalize" the right-wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of rationality in comparison with its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urinic version of the fall - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both of which seem to be a very mild offence in comparison to trump.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels of the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the klimpering music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Topic-Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the North of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park Karusel is still a strange magic experience, because here two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-twenties can go on it and have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually a neutral exchange should be, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologetic, while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of sleighs, which he suffered, according to a case in his cell, to the prison authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Upon murder following an appeal by the prosecutors, Pistorius was convicted against a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder, hiding in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2461">Three of the students will go to secondary school in the future, four to the secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="2462">On Tuesday evening school director Angelika Sitte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young Eagle that grew up in the poultry farm, but then released into freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2464">The mlower Schar introduced a musical with the title "The Eagle in the poultry farm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it hatch from its chickens.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Instead of chickens, a small eagle came out.</seg>
<seg id="2467">But the hope of making a chicken out of him was broken; the eagle stretched out his wings on a high mountain, and swore.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that, the classes three and four in the studio of Yvonne Frank showed a chicken dance.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young Gockles, the cylinders wore to make the bet.</seg>

<seg id="2486">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.</seg>

<seg id="2539">He reports about varied but challenging tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application has yet provided the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In this way - taking notice of the regular notice periods - should still be enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach acts as the Lower Construction Rights Committee for the Administrative Committee, the applicant must assign corresponding degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they couldn't fill it out more, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity to the town is important to the city and to him, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the old town stands under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the retiring City Builder emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the City Builder bears a lot of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is a client, "in the end everything runs here over my table."</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">However, a new study claims the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the affected person is usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that the essential amino acid tryptophan helps proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The conductive researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far toward inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance inducing immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"" "the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. Cross and a diet rich in tryptophan tolerates more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system also works in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was looking for a kind of immune cell that encourages tolerance, when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but that had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, normally living in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they were given to L. Cross and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria acted on the immune system, the researchers allowed L. Crucii to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. Crucii protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. Cross can develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. Cross can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to renovate their aged house in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition, Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development informed us about this on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a look back on what happened to date.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been areas of sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two-thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the redevelopment area II between 2005 and 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous restructuring is a "success project" - it is finally important to promote the development of the interior and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe that there will be a remediation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The total funding amount was €833 333, of which 500 000 Euros would be from the country, the rest of the congregation sensigen.</seg>

<seg id="2688">The measures would be object-related, that is, per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The redevelopment area would then finally be set as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grant period for the funding will continue until April 1, 2017 until April 30, 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">However, until September of this year, the survey would only be carried out in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation field to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, as soon as possible, the statute of proposition should be carried out, so that in the coming year it can be started with the restructurings.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The page of La Liga may be of interest to Marco Verratti.</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not leave Neymar in its persecution after giving up an offer of £189 million to release its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the World Record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach announced the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After the termination, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP a week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar forced his way out, although a spring near the Catalan board insists that the club always did his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the soccer world warned three years ago by the PSG President before this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a severe warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche" ("Wir sind Kirche"), announced after publication with the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Cathedral Choir Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false appraisal of the events at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that" "" "double standards" "" "were measured when reporting on violence in the cathedral scraps." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the assaults in Regensburg no one doubted that it was a "shameful and shameful act" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, too, said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we like to go to the church and this is a bound meal."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that" "" "blows was a normal educational tool" "" "in her youth," "" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's benchmarks to earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorabilia of "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take George Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hessia," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the findings of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were subjected to "high plausibility" between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility, "67 Domspatzen sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it can be said that, in many cases, domain masters have been used for physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotional appeal the punishment for the students was even more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to many other defendants, however, many victims have noticed that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even had positive memories with him despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Heshemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Violence Against Guards at the Regensburger Domspatzen," gives a contradictory picture of the Cathedral Choir Master Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students emphasise his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who has been tangible to the greener when a domain record musically produced no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of accomplice or co-operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The non-violence at the pre-school also took place outside of his sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can at best discard it, experience it too late or have not taken the first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived as literally "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes it as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "sincere," "competent" and "sympathetic," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes from children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotional appeal, which also led to outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only pop with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also parted ear-cowards and attracted too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the period of the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violent excesses at the pre-school, these are indeed Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more about his fame and role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still working eagerly at the Bavarian Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a lot was reported on the subject of abuse during the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger be charged any involvement or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael hesaman: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have trusted the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about this with my father or my mother," "" "said one of those affected," "" "Everything was very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even confide in their parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who, in a professional way, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hemann: a questionable student said: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd to assume that it was imputed to him... boys intrusive or clearer or even more likely to have opened than to their parents, boarding leaders, trustee teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"" "that you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way, the report concludes with a very clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their environment affected in advance could not be confirmed as part of the study." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to talk about any co-operation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">It cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these vile crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was a lot of" "" "violence excesses" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report" "" "Weglook" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hemann: that's the big problem that in the coverage everything mixed and mixed up became a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Because it is cleanly separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well as, let's say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report treats incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible prudence pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were really harassed and portrayed and suffered, were all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Cathedral master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the dome gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the one hand, as most of the witnesses pointed out, the topic "preschool" was taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "" "heavenly" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hemann: there was discipline, but not sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even had positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the reproach is not to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish himself and from operations at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then again at the end of 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently lose his ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral gymnasium, which the report was even reproducing.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that in the preschool, the punishment will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended an urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity persisted when Prüfer punishments were banned in Bavaria for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows well.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the people affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That just doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the Prüfer penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis states that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael hesaman:" "" "we are talking about the" "" "snapping of anachronism" "", "that is, the risk of evaluating past and present moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was too abominable at all times, and not for what has been violated in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am happy that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take George Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, so tearing the ear and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, it kept strictly adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger play in conversations with you for the book" "" "My brother the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of Prüfer rebuke also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, that the dometle sparrows played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I am not at all ashamed that he had a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that also has to be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one does not once again make a great singer and before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael hesaman: through the work on the book and beyond that, I have met George Ratzinger very well and experiences again and again as a wonderful, humorous, benevolent, deep-minded and heart-loving person, from whom you can't imagine that he could do something for a fly too.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get into contact with him, as many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read him, he is almost blind and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today, most of the dometles are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect for respect, to which they still look at and worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that is proposed to him are methods of education that were on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is only too obvious the evil intent behind it.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which has just been published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the state of affairs, a 93-year-old man who has gained great merits and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, would finally be in peace.</seg>
