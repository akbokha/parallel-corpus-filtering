a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother testified that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the corp@@ se found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS tran@@ smit@@ ters K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank lived first in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone wanting harm to his younger brother .

he never wanted to participate in any sort of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond shining brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the Hin@@ ter @-@ Wag@@ on of the S@@ F@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be stuck in drawers or glued from outside labels which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ing to me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan .
most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , vor@@ m television with loose de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , it is in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white gl@@ ut , she asks the children &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is depicted as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs from 25 August onwards .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger and some colleagues looked for a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pil@@ es &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses rec@@ alled at their celebrations , they ch@@ ased home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and that ended the riding career again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses .
he had his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even ho@@ ver for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and with that at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
in the context of a small gala , German sports aid handed over the Golden Mountain Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of hon@@ ours for the symp@@ a@@ thetic ath@@ lete .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th winner of the World Py@@ ramid of the World is long .
on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler in Aachen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for athle@@ tic successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been sponsor@@ ing the young .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros right away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the award @-@ winners are the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ ast of Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the ro@@ wers Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the leader Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was far from the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ divided in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely lag behind regul@@ ators , and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching fiscal reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , states that the state has certain tasks to fulfill , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
therefore the taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in need of investment , pump and Clinton are almost silent .
the democratic candidate is announ@@ cing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
thus , im@@ partial discussions could come to tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ ride coal mining in the USA .
oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement wants to cancel it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand the renewable energy with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , however , both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - they simply want to better protect American jobs .
they should be paid even better , says Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens , stands for boo@@ sting growth .
his critics considered him that the budget deficit would only be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house has a refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little one .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Executive Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social aid offers in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for all @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs organised the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as the hope @-@ makers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are other reasons for women to flee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their native country they have experienced sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tu@@ gs for example demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believes that when they arrive in Germany , the end is ir@@ re , B@@ ahr tells .
here , too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that around 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , she appreci@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not volunte@@ ered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what is experienced , because shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodation just for them , B@@ ahr calls for .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
some with no answer to the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for instance , there is no such thing in the housing of governments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , only wing@@ ed women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , lower and middle @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ia there are only for single women and their children in some common shel@@ ters or houses .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women be hosted separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or will men and women live together , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is available in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush they give to the house in Munich .
&quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; B@@ ahr says .
one could easily open a second house .
general Practi@@ tion@@ ers Stri@@ ke : demands for new combat measures
dep@@ u@@ ties of the Assistant Doc@@ tors have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more operational measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers would have agreed to address the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , assistance physicians and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to problems , leading to the rejection of the treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC has voted in favour of fully rej@@ ecting the proposed new treaty and asking for official re @-@ negotiations to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Board today set a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating labour measures that begins at the beginning of September .
the dispute resulted in assistance physicians to strike six times , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistant doctor , Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana , res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions which were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , stating that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara would most want this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile appeared narrow@@ ly and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan could have beha@@ ved as if something bad happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s shining , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the launch of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at that time was rage .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the c@@ ous@@ ins is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted assault on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan who he wanted to hear .
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he was reli@@ eved last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his office .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which every year typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television endor@@ sed cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed to be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the ongoing anger on the slu@@ gs emp@@ tier of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian head of state gained a bonus for claiming support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present , as an analy@@ st once described to me , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that feel ill and badly treated by the West and are now al@@ lied .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks the two pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey pur@@ pos@@ ely avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to under@@ line them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State should at least talk to one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the Executive Board of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumers brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands in focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized head office and stock exchange listing will change to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private customer business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he announced the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investment brand as well as the brand among which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming more a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we are not pursuing global goals , but pursuing local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these stamps .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori spark@@ les champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings 3@@ 000@@ th gain to him
jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reached the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ die and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori who won in front of him at G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ er when he wins the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nin@@ ef@@ old Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career branches
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only few people have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusi@@ astically received fans for this sport for years .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden in GB nearly 30 years of winners , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying D@@ ett@@ ori , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a number of major tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form .
and he &apos;s not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue at competitions up to his age of at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years old .
Russian Putin fires chief of staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
for many years IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the closest confidence circle of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is said that Putin has ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration without giving reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been his deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later served as Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that it is the government &apos;s main task to support your activity as head of state in terms of bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended his successor .
are the smiling faces convinced ?
this step has en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed Moscow .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest trusted Vladimir Put@@ ins for a long time and works like him for the Soviet Intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff reluct@@ antly res@@ ig@@ ned .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official statement - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , at one time would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks on Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compla@@ ining post for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V adopted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service , K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another suppor@@ tive ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producer
Gib@@ son participated in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a joint statement his dis@@ miss@@ al .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before announ@@ cing his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regre@@ t@@ ted the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son proceeds from the series following a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who had previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my entire heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season will be scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff asked for the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could be sand a@@ ale , which have been sp@@ out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land@@ Crossing : bridge connected to Fi@@ fe
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incl@@ ine ropes .
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
the Minister of Economy Keith Brown gave a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ hr@@ net cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the final section of the deck is now getting a g@@ ong for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking construction and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower in the expansion , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or east side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massi@@ vely , as the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs around 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3 % .
delicate as the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good luck &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station killed 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming as their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat rolling in its proximity and presented the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily the strong winds have already blown the boat out of range until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a boat hanging without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Jones : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have happiness un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had a stop@@ per , but it loos@@ ed the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has guarded these men today .
seriously injured - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal stuff .
instead , the alcoholic cul@@ pri@@ t cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother .
she then al@@ armed her sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ life partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds budget apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be more strongly involved in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that in the coming years , Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD suggests a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but controversy is programmed .
first of all , it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
so far a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be built on stock .
the big issue in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development program , which will cost millions of dollars and needs to be financed , is to provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions right now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to provide investors with as few rules as possible .
the left wants even harder jobs for investors .
despite this , so viol@@ ently , there is an intensi@@ fication of the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is still not complete : the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do we compensate for the loss of more about 1300 favorable apartments whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planned political spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back into the price range .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
at the end of the year , deadlines lie in the western city .
around 1800 homes one could get back to the price fixing for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically once more , it is removed from the goal of so @-@ called confusion .
a concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few neighbour@@ hoods will no longer exist .
the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there will be even more movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go into the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has focused on more construction sites for single family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside but prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens was compla@@ ined by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games , and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters created for video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand over@@ loaded by the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger joined the del@@ usion and j@@ umped up for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person re@@ stores each day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ stin , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of subsequent people who train every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people looking mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
anyone who regularly drives sport reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
as always , there are also crum@@ bling game spo@@ ils that always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
a breakthrough occurred .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they did not give us reason to do sports as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es Cre@@ ates Gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now the Olympic champion at last .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast inv@@ aded the title on Thursday and magni@@ fied the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team amer@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es performs on the Swedish bar during the single multi @-@ campaign event of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a winning title and in total the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey ended at this moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years its sport , 15 world med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u b@@ ail@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment .

Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell celebration of the retired Team Co@@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bill insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during her long journey , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - containing their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school flight in the gymn@@ asi@@ um , in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost any competition for the competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was guided by two turns , the picture van@@ ished .
Swedish bar and ground floor - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ tered .
she recovered with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam again - and sat on it with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her gently as she expected her den@@ ial - pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke passed to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her wor@@ d@@ ling , she cast the hands of the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the fast @-@ spreading twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ous applause when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series killer of Phoenix while they chat@@ ted in the car and heard music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two more injured in nine ass@@ aults in His@@ panic living areas within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his altern@@ ates , Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I can &apos;t do that .
I can &apos;t do that .
wher@@ eu@@ pon I did not let myself in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has left on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a help .
Ed@@ mund hasn &apos;t been able to sit or craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still can &apos;t talk .
but he is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund rewarded for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him a sign of sign , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News told .
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented a few characters on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as well as Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the zi@@ ka@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and pre@@ dictions may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of people infected with the zi@@ ka@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis since a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ virus .
it gets better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives cause for rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded its banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that inquiries for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in southern Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it continued to rain in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood a lot of houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the beaten rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams always picked up people from the flood water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet away from his house , greatly hei@@ gh@@ tened overnight .
he said that another son &apos;s son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told H@@ ans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated by Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread rapidly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there continued heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer moved close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said the rain has been significantly out@@ weighed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and the excursion into five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an ordered subsidiary in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were now both flooded .
the leader of Rob@@ by Miller &apos;s municipality said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets which were washed by flood .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ations .
&quot; as soon as the water begins to return , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen streets were closed due to the high water and sand@@ bags made available to the residents to take the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be in@@ und@@ ated , but no reports were reported on Friday .
Keith Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places I have never seen before , &quot; Tow@@ n@@ son said , &quot; and it is still coming . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfor@@ ated by balls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves sho@@ ot@@ ings in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police tells that the six @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents admitted that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital during his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has gone through a lot , his little body was sm@@ ashed from bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ors told Mel@@ Dec@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the transmitter that it is likely to recover again .
he should have started the first class at a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot at German@@ town .
likewise , three men were shot : two aged 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 year old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot on , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating if one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there had been a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
storm rif@@ les for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , approached the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a struggle that persi@@ sts .
on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given here several armed comb@@ at@@ ants who were very actively involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police det@@ achment Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the Police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles met in the area .
there was no arrest and police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a ag@@ ger on her arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police still searches for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ ads in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I have been there since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ds , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catholic , rounds off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one of female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected but master@@ ful gymn@@ astic routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see gymn@@ as@@ tics across the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all fought the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four tur@@ rets in the team . also , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics is an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts mainly in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents for training , orientation , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily .
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to au@@ n countless young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access exercise .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that earn the opportunity to learn and to benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that attracts thousands of young girls to be interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the wood of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , that you are motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed Treaty with the British Medical Association officials , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 resident doctors who voted in a vote refused him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t plans to introduce the Treaty by force and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first Assistant Doc@@ tors will receive a new contract which includes changes to night and weekend dates to improve the care of time @-@ to @-@ day care .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , president of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance doctors told last night in a message saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Assistance doctors have serious concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and to treat it to treat all physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by talks hit the government on reluct@@ ance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the case of a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to lift up the condition and address the worries of assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he fails to do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a re@@ plen@@ ishment of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the pi@@ cket chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed Treaty with the British Medical Association officials .
the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ end@@ ental compensation for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , called on the doctors to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; combat measures do not reach little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing and their families only worries , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the assistant doctor of the assistance doctors and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries to the concerns about tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ stle @-@ b@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional period , training lists , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training vac@@ ations and the gender @-@ specific wage gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreement with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can lower heart attacks
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that constitute floor@@ ings .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ aches blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ logged the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having a further risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the draft Recommen@@ dation of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness allows electoral fraud to flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report on corruption from office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread suff@@ rage in Muslim communities becoming know@@ ingly ignored , as a devastating government report today revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town coun@@ cils to ignore evidence of electoral abuse as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption sc@@ andal , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elec@@ tive cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should have a passport to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er merely has to name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they give up their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions made by un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for electoral fraud , but also aims to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s election sc@@ andal in the east of London .
last year , a special selection tri@@ bunal decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; cy@@ ni@@ cally , &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which one person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he expressed in particular al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the conduct of ID cards to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as evidence , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , to choose according to the will of the El@@ derly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi backgrounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions had unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system , including the prohibition that political activists process letter selection documents in order to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral roll being used for immigration and social security purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic postal voting .
ban on political activists to process full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes from post@@ ings .
the police have the authority to set up barri@@ ca@@ des for election stations .
a change of law that facilitates an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( law of the People &apos;s Assembly 1983 ) .
ban on photography in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English must be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of training to ensure that the employees generally assert that voters go to the cabin on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case was no criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral judgment has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his substitute for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the town@@ houses elec@@ tive registration departments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Sir Eric : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the Mother of Par@@ liam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
this week fans of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games are advised by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ member of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympics is by far not the only ath@@ lete competing for gold that has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
apart from K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused an attack on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star sc@@ ary alike .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so I take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly highlight this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is said to be a doppel@@ gan@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for many years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the inc@@ eption actor &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian Silver Med@@ al Flo@@ at Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va features more than just sun tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans to the same &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory put into space : according to this user there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , broad smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at dr 4x@@ 100m free @-@ sty@@ ling player of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
the Canadian television channel C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; went off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m cros@@ stal@@ k relay .
Mac@@ Donald , who was caught on board in the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to add more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as I called M@@ ief , he died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer , Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the floating Squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadian to close the gap to China .
viewers throughout Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ my@@ lane twe@@ aked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that 14 @-@ year @-@ old Flo@@ wers from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ sty@@ ling squ@@ ad@@ ron for women : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was quick and hard , many of whom were talking to him .
Twitter users did not keep back when they heard how un@@ aware By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
shortly afterwards , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times to the people who responded to the Noti@@ ce on Twitter
the commentary fellow Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and released a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be radi@@ ated .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers in the social media with our audience .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
however , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zing and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was conceived as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olympic game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was referring to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark indign@@ ant over woman who tried sham@@ elessly under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mal bed to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed as she looked at it , dra@@ gged it out and put it back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark store in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before putting them back into the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in the shop at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried her under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales floor she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled her own rib@@ bons and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet spot to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like since she put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , moving up again and going out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take home under@@ pants that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and not washed her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were pulled out of the sale .
how to protect oneself against arms attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers near distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer to your pre@@ dat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you approach you from behind , then you should turn around first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then strike your knees in the gro@@ in and twist while the as@@ sail@@ ant is cro@@ oked from pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel and move backwards as she directed the gun to him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on your chest , then twist the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and directing the weapon onto it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it happened to Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y it is saf@@ est to hand over your money unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ lined his immune system and san@@ itation of a serious test by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook his course on a euro ticket , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a washing button of a draw toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before de@@ cking each object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he &apos;s going to get .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought to lick the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a traction toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his trip through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task put his immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; As a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ escence of more than 4000 units .
compared to that , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick off after its lumin@@ omet@@ ry number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of Da@@ iry Products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick it here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company is equi@@ pping Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something fascinating to look at and at the same time explaining the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of gastro@@ intestinal bacteria and 58 percent said that they would at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social Family Dest@@ ro@@ yed by Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung Sozial@@ Flat in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left its social dwelling after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ vation with a loss of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized its neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ as@@ o , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had pla@@ stered holes , wooden boards were torn , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer re@@ pairing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ fe and floo@@ ding .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn
neighbors testified that they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called on the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner forci@@ bly from the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was being made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not killing anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we put the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , testified that the family would have agreed to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house to which the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the over@@ grown side of the church building tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , as a dele@@ tion is always the final step into consideration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message communic@@ ates that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ xing on the floor
workers of the house administration will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ nia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was given a fine after she had found herself guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial law .
she claimed that the money was for a grave of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after they were without shelter , it was assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti coated .
the police tells them that they will navigate rent@@ ers who do not abide by the rules of the house
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall informed that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not obey the rules of the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ reproach , and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal set in panic after an eff@@ ig@@ ent military jet beach is flying
sun worshi@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal lived the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on airplane of the Air Force put an incredible flight back
the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no safety risk
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an open jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage shows how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal near the beach .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up when they were understand@@ ably starting to worry about the noise of the nozzles , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who posted videos about the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice , and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the bad visibility due to the surrounding area fires , but the air forces persi@@ sted that safety was at no time at risk .
this summer , area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people on Madeira island came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for status as number one for two years in Barcelona .
coach Luis En@@ rique , up to now , refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other applications .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a Liverpool test game with 0 : 4 .
also at the 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ get@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know convincing .
Sev@@ ille , in turn , lost the 2 : 3 defeat after an extension in the European Super@@ cup versus Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with eleven successes to date , Barcelona is the record winner in this contest .
Ma Long in an own league table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma long is the new table tennis Olympic winner .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided final .
with this , the World Ranking Editor won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with success at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese J@@ un Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympia podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate alone , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches with them .
they had withdrawn into the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors on a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have played the matches until here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final , I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said to be logical .
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists with the China flag posed .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ versary only in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected stirring match was developed .
nevertheless , sufficient breathtaking ball changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ th@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ White had injured a rib@@ bing injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle &quot; with tin . &quot;
by the way , Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tr@@ ump sums up ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states losing their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the former repub@@ li@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed such a thing as concerns reported as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own repub@@ li@@ can camp , there is now a doubt about his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt should be false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sh@@ u@@ ffle .
w@@ ob@@ ble repub@@ li@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , equ@@ ated .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump at the front , but not by the distance common to repub@@ li@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also endangered as endangered .
in an interview with CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
and afterwards : this will be either successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not do anything else than to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not sufficient for him for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party is said to have threatened to cut funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey values .
instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans want to intervene more closely in the hands of the Congress .
Olympics : thir@@ sty sc@@ ams for dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary committee in such a case .
Ken@@ y@@ as athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer to Kenya .
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately establish a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ etter F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesperson shared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following IO@@ C measures , IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , released and signed the test , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 in Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters .
four days earlier , Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is reported to have informed athletes of his country about pending d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences in Kenya , Kenya has been under special observation for a long time .
at the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was un@@ common to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic beginning .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya has taken off from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have been raised again and again in Kenya that dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in the Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it was possible to prove that this type of sport has been systematically and systematically dop@@ ed .
consequently , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games .
the Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary .
the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he he@@ ats .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she recalls with melanch@@ oly her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve and passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise to the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli goes back to the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly topical : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ars went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
these are the same topics , and today they are as meaningful as they were at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined IS was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , died re@@ port@@ edly in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that they were killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - keeping people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ u@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tana &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and she became a widow within a few months .

Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Justice Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ can in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate , Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell , believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson for Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if he would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Republi@@ can blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants to make nude calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mers to bring a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys differenti@@ ates as &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , he believes it does the calendar also .
&quot; we must return to the presentation of timeless and classical n@@ ak@@ edness , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or in person at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not suit and lo@@ dges Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kur@@ dist@@ an Community of Germany expects a short term with tens of thousands of people seeking refuge from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chairman of the association , Ali Top@@ ra@@ k , believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard drive of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , Kurdish community Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , with tens of thousands , in the medium term , I reck@@ on with several hundred thousand protected workers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already over@@ taken Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions three months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing from Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dec@@ ei@@ ving put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that receives refugees in its own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the association compla@@ ined of the systematic settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ ctic cities .
in doing so , Erdo@@ gan hopes to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or expelled already in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Association called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire markings as Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers destroy teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the paper reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks have already constituted the largest group of asylum seekers accepted for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all were eligible for asylum @-@ seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey do not find themselves the victims of war , poverty or lack of perspective .
asylum seekers pursuant to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t receive anything from the summer campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania they understood .
in 2021 the country election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament decided already at the beginning of the year .
because it &apos;s not stupid to date : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ day sw@@ ag@@ gering - that bites itself .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaig@@ ners , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not a native , so do not choose the country day .
there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and counting voices in the end , just lab@@ ori@@ ously drive out .
until September 4 , 2016 , the electoral and the last holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to make an election campaign close to the people once again .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition matter .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , one can see from his big posters .
he travels through the land , distri@@ butes roses and chat a bit with the people , just as it did his legendary , word @-@ like predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
apart from that , he has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel is responsible for the flo@@ wering of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is to make an election campaign at the right place at the wrong time .
she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations twice ; Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kreis is located in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , even Angela Merkel .
apart from that , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , according to Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union also noted that on the ground , you crum@@ ble the base that it must ex@@ ert a lot to find a wire to the people again .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the council of the CD@@ U campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert at his co @-@ workers is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD a particularly committed campaign .
in the poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats Group last dropped 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election in 2011 , the SPD won a clear victory of 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the country &apos;s day .
they are making a modern virtue out of their holiday needs and largely postpon@@ ed their election campaign to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise green campaig@@ ners engage in search of traces of local vocal ch@@ ords among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ts just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and also finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffering from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m. , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site was scheduled to be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October .
it will also be praised for the coming up of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation entran@@ ces .
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ route in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has returned , the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed .
the citizens can now turn from the B 27 on both sides by O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen .
the ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been some considerable discomfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy chief conductor Florian King , responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ el@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping routes were seeking and rather trusted their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to a failure of some trucks in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not met , the municipality also called for M@@ ös@@ singen &apos;s measuring vehicle .
&quot; there were considerable over@@ rides , &quot; says King , who made himself know@@ led@@ geable on the spot .
two to three per minute have already been fired .
the fastest was on the way with 77 mph @-@ kilometres in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg now the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 re@@ development has led to revenue out@@ breaks , everyone who is asked to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the end customer , i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for the renovation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier , but also acknow@@ le@@ dges that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mil@@ eage is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most exploited is the local area along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; hard . &quot;
customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenues amounted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road renovation was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back for two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other farms where so much more generous was handled .
with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
finally , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , refers to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are now seeing less frequently due to complicated traffic guidance .
if you can &apos;t drive down , it &apos;s also elsewhere nice .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family @-@ clientele has returned to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and a bird flu G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work is brutal .
all the time , in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is bol@@ ted to laws .
after the latest attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a discrimination status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the verse .
all his proposals are politically unacceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package .
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
others , further points , would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was in results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at@@ tain@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the latest attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gave a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for the security of the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , filed : that a new security authority is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nor is it the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines on air passenger data and weapons legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is launching a second attempt on proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that doesn &apos;t have any chances in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas are also presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones in advance and use social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately disc@@ ard their papers in order to obsc@@ ure their identity .
some of these are political and legal .
some also have an un@@ balanced effect and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to argue that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
moreover , in view of the high levels of refugees , many people were worried about safety .
and things that the people pro@@ found@@ ly occupied did not let themselves be cl@@ ung out in election campaigns .
the inner security has moved tremend@@ ously into focus .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election campaigns .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking place in the issue of internal security .
in the past few days between the two parties .
first a gar@@ ner@@ ed dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also ar@@ du@@ ous here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a return from the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ended the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not make sense to re @-@ impose them .
and in the case of a bur@@ ka prohibition , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things to worry about .
but the SPD is currently trying to benefit from internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first signals cau@@ ti@@ ously and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still a lim@@ pf@@ ront .
despite diesel @-@ sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers are increasing worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
in the recall action there are vor@@ ti@@ ces around a term .
Volkswagen launches its shipments in the second half of the year .
despite the diesel conditions , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus , despite the diesel conditions , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July the core brand VW declined primarily in Western Europe and thus bur@@ dened the total sales of the company , as listed in the Da@@ x listed company .
in July , the VW brand sold a 1.8 percent less car with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe , after China , the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries dropped by almost one sixth .
head of sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker numbers from July above all to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there have been a reluct@@ ance to buy in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU was also bur@@ dened by a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas was first calibr@@ ated , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Sax@@ ons continues to get worse by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition drop of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
sales Chief Fred Kap@@ pler continued to assign a sales platform from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust test .
in Germany alone , VW is calling about 2.5 million cars to be converted into workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW , VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the retro@@ fitting , the car manufacturer offers a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was said on Friday in business circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason to be legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now granting German customers a warranty for retro@@ fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW representative in the Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport confirms that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA in full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after retro@@ fitting will not deterior@@ ate and all relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen relies on the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but not as it was said in business circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen regards the possibility that , for example , half a year after the retro@@ fitting , customers can come to a workshop for example half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the interests of customers , it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal as regards possible warranty rules as it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why VW is not using the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see calls for pun@@ ctu@@ ations from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
on Thursday , head of banking , Josef Paul , said : &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who can park 40 million euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers are not afraid to pay criminal charges for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euros to cash or daily money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 costs will be 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time now , he ski@@ pped 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , the costs now pass on .
leaving the cash simply in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank saf@@ es would be far too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four rob@@ ber@@ ies , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Bank Board .
most customers would have understood and changed to other types of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavarian cooperative association declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone is not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian economy and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 made head@@ lines with pun@@ ches for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele furnished by fortune a little more luxuri@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it hats money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the G@@ mund cooperative bank has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no further banks known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ PR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and the emig@@ ration of investors to competition is threatening .
customers in Germany won &apos;t like that in width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle aged loves plates .
before you make ha@@ ste to comment under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of Non@@ Alle@@ con@@ ia &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re @-@ emergence of records is not due to a boom in millenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a horror by amateur collectors - it has an emotional impact : older record buyers rather keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , take a modest grey suit and stay wild before I stop , hold my hands and say something like this : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - still there is a handful of fantastic plate specialist shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , the I of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of middle age , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 s@@ labs .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot via e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and buy items that he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things where I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my truck .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the You@@ g@@ v profile .
but he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records .
from the conversations I have led , people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar sil@@ enc@@ ers , from objects that ev@@ oke happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be a void of empt@@ iness or possessions of material possessions as a sort of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a collector for me and I think it &apos;s like that for many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee bur@@ sts out of a stack of boards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month had not yet heard of it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have a record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I look through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone just recently entered here and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead LP , so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older people who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the record to almost a whole floor , has a lively audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ tet Pop instead of experimental jazz mo@@ ans from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but emotional trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ectable when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale .
she is more like a shopping mannequ@@ in than a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it casts off with a de@@ ar@@ aged si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I am giving the impression to wear jeans in jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they are not considered , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors that exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their th@@ urs@@ day morning with security not with stro@@ lling through record stores on Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates while they ste@@ er clear of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old er@@ ron@@ eous host who raises no uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional transactions in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which afford a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the government @-@ backed union and other groups would not provide sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decre@@ ed that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely track@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is generally operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant

&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight further , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the passing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace what reasons would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin really wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed meas@@ urer : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash units are tested , which are intended to transfer speed units very effectively .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident points , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary speed polishing , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary bla@@ ster for keeping speed limits .
but a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be detected simultaneously across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans by time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , the trailer can be fitted with any car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels disappear in the arm@@ oured and by the way also bul@@ let @-@ proof outer cover .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter against v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
also foreign authorities are flash@@ ing with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ he rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class wins gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by ended on Thursday evening with an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji granted a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , back press , line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic med@@ all@@ ist of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they proposed New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in its best form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t be - that at least one Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan .
here they lost only one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonder@@ full and made the attacks of G@@ Bs from fun boun@@ cing .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one were running in driving coaches . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au passed over in the corner .
with more than four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
an hon@@ orable T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a left a touch @-@ down in the right corner and stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through further weak Tac@@ tics of the GB team and stor@@ med down to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play 7 , while GB is still learning .
this is how it is .
GB performed basic changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ang gap ... for a total of four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half , until Joshua passed away from Fi@@ ji after a brilliant incident .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Se@@ as , whose fans sang , flags wave and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB ki@@ cked crush@@ ingly in the law@@ ns .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a short half @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks in the first half forward , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and with that the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer for a rowing victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ ali@@ eres gold than with these games and that wants something to be called .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard hit , which enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only the two who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was omni@@ present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympi@@ ad in a row without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports who set such a benchmark .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ ter unconditional deployment , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was helpful than the trainer who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago if he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ked .
I had bladder cancer , which is operated and that did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough .
this is how it starts .
the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ growing morning with something more than anything else to talk and thus tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning who was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s maybe a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I have worked for , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have liked a better person to train or have a better trainer .
Helena bell@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to keep up .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very much at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; pale in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race as we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taken care of clarity for 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert Gr@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose association as an example for the large water producers .
this was the name of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk &apos;s contribution some time ago .
little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia cho@@ os@@ ed the con@@ ta@@ gion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who has been in the purpose @-@ association for 31 years , 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ gasse , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for other towns and municipalities .
the current Chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert Gr@@ öller was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the purpose @-@ association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance to office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency appointments on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chair@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new F@@ oun@@ tain ( 1994 ) , purchase of land in the area of the new F@@ oun@@ tain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ development of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and there are always new things added because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he acted as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
for that he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ eller , on his part , praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ man and he was a faithful cr@@ unch .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view he described the building of the well and the restructuring of the purpose @-@ association .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult task was the rup@@ ture at Kirch@@ gasse at Kirch@@ gasse on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n could only be maintained , because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

Rel@@ ation@@ ship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - A man shoots up to a companion of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot on his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10 : 45 a.@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him I am publicly prosec@@ uted .
meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald head .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
meanwhile , the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could carry the weapon with him , so the police .
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship apparatus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the cul@@ pri@@ t in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck initially did not want to make any statements about the departure or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; but it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not saying more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , there was a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity promotion are from the table .
it remains with the release of the renewable energy environment in the constitu@@ ents of the so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at first , the European Commission had planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic statement with the European Commission after talks with commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants , an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent is required .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomes Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for power generation .
this is the reason why the status quo of the current regulation is largely as@@ cer@@ tained .
this is particularly important for the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is the future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of the emissions allowance , climate and employment targets are to be considered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation further intensified when China &apos;s world &apos;s largest producer of producers threw steel on the world market amid the weak@@ ling domestic demand .
European producers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has become somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on imported steel have effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have risen .
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp cau@@ ti@@ ously remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have been stagn@@ ant again .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the end Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the steel trade association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been down two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her entire life : as a young girl she was in the school choir and in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt studies she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German sen@@ iors &quot; league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , senior citizens can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to talk and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this purpose sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who regularly challenge their lungs will not get out of the powder in everyday life too quickly .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in elderly people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &quot; Organis@@ ations .
in the older generations , the shared singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs ar@@ ouses many memories with older people , often linked to positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
by song lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia sometimes dev@@ ise themselves to long @-@ lying events .
in singing , a special performance is required for the head , explains L@@ enz .
focusing at the same time on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone are practicing to concentrate not only on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the feeling of self @-@ esteem is also growing through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I do something for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing are enough .
if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if you think you have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a tone goes next to it ?
looking for the right offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior benchmark , one can easily connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many senior choirs may also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet research .
if you feel like singing , you should join a choir , &quot; H@@ ac@@ kler says .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers at cries of the young
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hannover which effect the calls of k@@ itt@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they always remained the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of k@@ itt@@ ens in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens who think themselves in great need , as scientists have discovered by the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acousti@@ cal differences between the mi@@ st@@ ings of less and strongly arous@@ ed young are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance for the males , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten scre@@ ams were different with the ur@@ gency of their need for help .
a total of nine adult males and eight que@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were pre @-@ recorded for a th@@ ief of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally raised .
despite the small sample , the researchers keep their results meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned to the speaker more quickly , when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played out .
this ability may possibly be born or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males did react at all , &quot; the bi@@ ologist said .
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noise .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
ahead of the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ ta Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the World Cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
even with the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the daily routine of normal citizens , should not be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it does not stop before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r .
according to this , the Sü@@ ley@@ r living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ley@@ r is to be a follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days still remains until October , in fact , it has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Erdo@@ gan declared the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the majority of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially welcome to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved his sporting value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory @-@ bull@@ se@@ ye .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion .
after the round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; will also leave early in the Europa League .
in the Swe@@ de Li@@ g it reached rank six only .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year of play was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 season buff@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher @-@ King .
this is also the reason that the fans hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , which was contracted by AC Florence under contract and announced to Bes@@ ik@@ tas , after the coup attempt , failed to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Má@@ ri@@ ó wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she cited the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on top of that , however , the Stür@@ mer would have to be prepared to ren@@ ounce about a third of the annual salary paid to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man stated clearly : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als chance at Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova must not start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had compla@@ ined about her start right after a dop@@ ing block , was pi@@ ped out of mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters breast ) .
there was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery : with a set smile , she was still proud in the hall and provoked her appearance .
when it was clear that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst into a rush @-@ storm .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the D@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to stop a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after taking the pain medication Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , World Champion of 2013 and European Champion , was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic disputed s@@ wis@@ s capture and was blocked for six months .
the four th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the big gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positively in 2010 and locked for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , deceived Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ lete has recognised as many med@@ als afterwards .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after finding testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to give Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the European title in 2006 because of testosterone deficiency .
he also received the Bronze Med@@ al of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Tribunal CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the World Ranking List .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km of walking , China ) : the world record and gold favorite was tested positive only in May but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to taking a forbidden food supplement were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran off already on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered from wounds and had been treated at the hospital , but I had already left it again .
she planned her home@@ ward journey at the beginning of September .
whether by the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on , Austrian citizens are also still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in first explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported by Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ onation close to the beach of Pat@@ ong , which was popular with vac@@ ation@@ ers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban staff .
according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower @-@ be@@ et in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ eastern coast demanded several injuries .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks are bearing the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee , Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to manifest itself to potential motives , but it is likely that it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the attacks , Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks would not arise in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities have received intelligence on upcoming attacks in the south of the country over the past few days , but they have not been informed of the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
police directed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they don &apos;t turn against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace which was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the present bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need for travelling into these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is heading towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ port@@ edly uph@@ eld the power of restoring the Kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels who have been sm@@ elling in the extreme south of the country for years .
in the conflict more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed .
nearly a year ago , in Bangkok , 20 people were killed during an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is targeted at the Federal Office for Constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several state offices , the constitutional guards in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see &apos; identity movement &apos; clu@@ es for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D spokes@@ man on constitutional affairs Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants from Islamic beliefs or the Middle East are har@@ med in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we now observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his authority was closely aligned with the country &apos;s offices during the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; groups like the &quot; identical movement &quot; are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the chairman of the constitution .
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a more you@@ thful language , often with pop music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda should address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there have been reports of contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Af@@ D politicians in several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no knowledge about that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - will change its direction by certain people , who are extrem@@ ist , and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not identi@@ fiable .
with a view to the marked increase of legitimate off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ aß said he would not yet speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism .
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
it may well be that further righ@@ tist groups or small groups are forming the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognis@@ able .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed concern that many offen@@ ders went to the account of people who did not appear before in the right @-@ wing scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wor@@ rying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum lod@@ gings were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or followers of the right @-@ wing scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or left who have then radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te Bec@@ omes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympic Games or World Records don &apos;t always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia sw@@ am so slow that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ asi@@ t became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first course with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather not his athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 year old particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start @-@ up right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more popular .
since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media marked him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ hale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only started with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ant from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to travel alone in a run over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired back then .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old was able to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately it will either work out , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if for him , in the end , for reasons of political correctness , this is ok , said Tr@@ ump .
so he called US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more opposition formed .
post increases in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the mail plans to sell your electric car Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter also .
in the near future , the Group plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market as of the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they want to sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to other companies .
post @-@ Managing Director Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there is always re @-@ asking , for example by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bonn Group wants to enter into mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in post @-@ owned production , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ ald had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and to ensure a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles over the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very tough step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter is active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
G@@ FR@@ P leadership step down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research firm Gf@@ K exchanges its head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the Market Research Group Gf@@ K allowed the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann to be all the more uns@@ af@@ e , the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ences at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after renewed dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the global number five in the industry is facing a new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P Executive Board plans to leave the company by the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahler is already leaving the supervisory board with effect as of September 12 .
the management board of the Management Board already passed the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger as of September 1 , and shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor has been found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ignation , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to mention a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
anyone who will be conducting the market research company in future is still unclear at this time .
in investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders last had the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring will not be seen even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , any shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; if it were the case with BMW , that would also do the odds , &quot; he said .
following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the Company was unable to stop its loss journey in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales rose by 6.1 percent below the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in relation to the first half of the year , sales contracted by 3.4 percent to 7@@ 2@@ 1,2 million euros .
the profit in the second quarter , above all , imp@@ acted the company &apos;s s@@ unken value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the company value depreci@@ ation of 139 million euros , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience Business Unit , resulted in a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros under the bottom line .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K achieved a consolidated profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
in case of an accident involving 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , divided the police .
according to the figures , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to ev@@ ade a truck that was partly on the reverse track .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people were not able to leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the scene of the accident on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ all .
there they should wait for a spare bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 Euro for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ole 3,@@ 44 ; for allow@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household by the District Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was noted that sub@@ coverings have been used for this sewage treatment plant .
due to legal principles , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ effectively .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to dig deeper into the wal@@ let .
revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented the board , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over and under covers from the preceding period of calculations are to be compensated .
Schmidt explained that all three waste water systems were relatively small , with a very low waste water drop , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining .
furthermore , in the past period of the calculation , all three installations were not least due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses to a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt indicated that in the waste water plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage .
the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up in the pump station . after nearly 20 years of operation , the first clari@@ fication pond had to be postpon@@ ed , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued support and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were considerably below the current level in the previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the small sewage treatment in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; fully beat . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of major entertainment costs in wastewater facilities , has been spar@@ ed in the past 20 years .
in the opinion of stone houses , the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious , especially as the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal waste water association could not be extended because these facilities are defici@@ ent institutions .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) amounted to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
in July 2016 , a price hike of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect is critici@@ zed as Asian carto@@ ons
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a painting from a Roy Licht@@ enstein .
the filters are non @-@ flo@@ wery , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ carri@@ ages reach the public .
in the past Snap@@ chat filters have attracted criticism in the past , in which they were accused of promoting Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when this week some users proposed a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yel@@ low@@ tail &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asked themselves if these repeated controversi@@ es referred to a major problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage was widely spread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism resem@@ bled the filter of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely used over the photographs , wrote that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and fla@@ un@@ ting . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effect .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been moved into the degra@@ ding extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride of stum@@ bling .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats is a big audience of young people - who in terms of race are more diverse than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters an image that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the modelling practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leaders and finished their article with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has left Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently hired a personnel manager who focuses on under@@ represented sections of the population and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu also said she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS secret services information , identifies committee of Congress
military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence to sign an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it had allowed the actual conditions on site , announced an investig@@ ative committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a task force of the Republi@@ can members of the army committees , secret service committees and the military budget compromise , reports of great dis@@ content under Central Command intelligence chief analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their estim@@ ations to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence @-@ related information , which were typically den@@ ounced by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , posted a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in Cent@@ Com are reaching the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government leaders have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress were much more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com affiliated publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command has changed intelligence reports to reduce the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports is underway by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense .
on Thursday , democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest @-@ ranking democr@@ ats in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dispro@@ portion@@ ately little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General inspec@@ tor who was taken up by Cent@@ Com analy@@ st complaints .
Mr. Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the former government under George W. Bush faced only a small occupation force in Iraq , and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government agencies , states that contrary to the statements made by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the United States wins fourth match in the women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with Great Britain
one day after shooting three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place will take the strong D@@ ut@@ ch@@ man a bit longer from the way that the other group will lead .
whatever the game happens on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising host through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time in three years she had a ho@@ ckey player in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things into a better place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have the ru@@ dder being able to rip off completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the area .
India had gone into play without a win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and le@@ aped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the Rio de Janeiro events are constant and inevitable , a fur@@ ious relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning bar , which is handed down to tri@@ athletes by the cross@@ bow guard to the s@@ wimm@@ ers .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ gru@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who was for the first time at the Olympics and a flock of women with di@@ mp@@ le , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it reign for a long time .
but if I should have a decent argument for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although jumping on a trampoline has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ sely aware that many of the people I had surv@@ eyed did not know that there is an olymp@@ ia port at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans that for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear to a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has a humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish tabl@@ eland , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to face a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and let@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
they are rated according to the official Olympic programme according to the design , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must go far@@ ther , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground .
they do not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also a further highlight in television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ans of the Olympi@@ ans .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is pos@@ h , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator into tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel as a bit ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , going up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
the qualification and final round of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time , which the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the end hours as part of a night@@ time block on both days starting at 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear of man and the obj@@ ec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base after air .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the US &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testified that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police when switching to firing .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was ruth@@ less , according to human rights organisations .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to supp@@ ress the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven to the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critical vote last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des , who were forced more or less in recent years , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of the onset of H@@ ink@@ öch@@ el@@ n under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that very many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate through social media since cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians came to protest against the protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of time , the Am@@ har@@ a , who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , accounting for around 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012 .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate enemies and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ar@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
in contrast to Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North @-@ Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which according to analysts were apparently mess@@ ed up by the government and stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in recent months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , like the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously , this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal de@@ ple@@ tion of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it accepts a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray became more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the US government used Ethiopia as the base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , even if she recently announced that she closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; this , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains Obama &apos;s claim that IS@@ IS was founded was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump , on Friday , tried to dissip@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
it also brings with it his fellow campaig@@ ners who endeav@@ our to take him in protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant at all .
after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump reg@@ ained in reference to the alleg@@ ation on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to signi@@ fy that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation perfectly serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing of it .
the last storm of criticism confron@@ ts Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to declining survey values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump again tried to return to this subject .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later on he explained , &quot; Of course , I thought that sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to what the reaction fails . &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man said , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more corro@@ sive tone as his survey values have continued to decline .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading edge in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he is increasingly focusing in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump has brought his loyal followers into the uncomfortable situation to be faced with , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave great effort to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CN@@ N interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani to the accuracy of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s asser@@ tions , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ ind legs , completely wrong , and that &apos;s why it happened because he drew the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton had served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread herself by subj@@ ecting the situation in the Middle East in an aggressive way .
ahead of the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once pushed over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ ggy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were ou@@ sted from Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
the business So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local residents used it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ ool wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and verb is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it is also new invention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafe , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do so , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ nish@@ es such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ te onions .
there are rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also driven by Pri@@ zes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , and visited the verb regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the club closed , she gave up the coffee drinking a while , she said .
&quot; it became clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture in the club that I liked , &quot; she said .
now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and take up new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal is still receiving his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he did not make a res@@ ent@@ ment about the fact that the soap shop took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for clubs with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re going to deal with her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer transl@@ ates the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he pre@@ tends to exhibit it soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a nearby building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the bark@@ ing felt a new coffee like hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined Fi@@ fth Avenue delicacies such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water Car@@ pet Sou@@ p Sou@@ p .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while bricks were told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they show culinary solidarity as they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , au@@ st@@ ere snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the repor@@ ter ordered h@@ ack@@ fry , this found the couple suitable for discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man said .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper to reach the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts as they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been like lead in the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to hung@@ ering Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; records the ways with which the country was not going to be the land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e committed why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new bud@@ ding was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods that could re@@ use c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Ziegel@@ man , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat that has been the center of American cuisine for many years has become a rare luxury .
peculiar mixes have been tried out as a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy kitchen .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before , or since then , house@@ keeping econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - under@@ took the eating habits of the country .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household leaders &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ mir @-@ Cake @-@ eating attitude .
while he openly praised the simple I@@ owa agr@@ arian kitchen of his cuisine , he fed like the million @-@ million man of the world to which he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stamp an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the arrival of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms Roos@@ ev@@ elt made that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the land returned to its legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; Ziegel@@ man , &quot; as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple had better understood the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was afraid of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
after the plates had been cleared with Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called a run@@ e W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man said , adding that it was a nasty trick to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody di@@ ved somewhat reluct@@ antly a spoon in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E three times recovered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few h@@ ack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombing attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group which , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life into play to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil protection that shows him during an 11 @-@ hour saving of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , said al@@ oud : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die in saving lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters raised four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb so that children do not play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture quoted his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland hair usually comes to the surface only in winter .
after an examination aboard the research ship S@@ anna , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms at a mere 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks only get up with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it is on average just 1.@@ 220 meters far .
only when it comes to it , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this slow@@ ness @-@ shaped lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal Science &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k that could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ bare of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed long that Greenland &apos;s hair becomes st@@ ony .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are hard to observe , finally they mainly live in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
her slow @-@ ser@@ pent@@ ines measured her , when she out@@ fitted six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
still , this sh@@ arks do this sh@@ arks : researchers found the remains of a seal in the stomach of an animal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , which tor@@ ped@@ o from higher water @-@ str@@ ata .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland shar@@ k , who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest shar@@ k measured 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when atomic weapons gra@@ b@@ bed larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal , with a length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , which is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in their l@@ enti@@ ls all larger Greenland @-@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 watch showed a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k at the age of 3@@ 35 , while the record Ha@@ i with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res is even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now researchers of length have been able to classi@@ fy an age .
since one of the animals stood at the threshold of the sexually mature with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res and was determined at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined , Greenland &apos;s hair obviously allows at least one and a half centuries of time .
this would also be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such methane em@@ its live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland whale , whose bac@@ on stuck on the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught up in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often also runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us .
they then mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large .
the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ bare .
a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources more in a long life .
building site in double pack
the council at the latest meeting focused on topics related to construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted the message from mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after clari@@ fying the plot , par@@ cel@@ ing and closing questions and the applications for sur@@ ve@@ ying , the sale of the properties in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - exit section 1 ) is nothing more in the way of interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the rural areas in the rural and quiet residential community attract young families and other sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , building wil@@ lows can immediately announce themselves in the Town Hall , with the allocation of the par@@ c@@ els , the council is likely to be advised in its September session .
in order to make inquiries about the settlement of further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year in some areas .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ expos@@ n , the already designated commercial area is extended by two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
thus , the city on the Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Market of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks should continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU passport &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they have been approved in the UK so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why big US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such is the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Assessment ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB .
&quot; proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
Luxembourg has a large fund industry , but also drastically cut off Dublin &apos;s infrastructure .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
it also points to the city with easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the business consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ists say .
in London , according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal expenses from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc . claims for reimbur@@ sement of legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two Mer@@ ck patents , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ of@@ i of Gilead following a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts .
when charging the law@@ suit on Thursday , US judge Beth @-@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck seeks to equ@@ ate Gilead with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck accused each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops backed by the US say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
supported by the US troops have rec@@ ap@@ tured full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have abandoned them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the demo@@ cra@@ cies of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are cur@@ bing after the removal of the still remaining group of fighters who have been dig@@ ging within the city , currently the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stage by the fighters , Shar@@ on Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council of Reu@@ ters , al@@ lied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are running clean@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD $ 1 million for charity , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton gave an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , published his tax returns for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; stated Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ pul@@ sion with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax assessment by tax authorities as a reason for ref@@ using .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the democr@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presidential candidate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump &apos;s special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspections are not complete .
the Cri@@ tic Cri@@ tic , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already shown that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , its donations for char@@ itable organisations , its business and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lic@@ ans asked Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she addressed the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co reported that in the 1990s , Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little tax , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , which would still be the case .
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people who pay more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka last week , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , has called Tr@@ ump into a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump had &quot; fear &quot; before the elec@@ tors and not in front of the tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published a tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , average an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that these only accounted for USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their principal financial investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton Divi@@ den@@ ds and Ear@@ nings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ py@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ anian Ele@@ ph@@ ant Protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ bu@@ ds .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ le@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , intensified its promotion together with the U.S. Nature Protection by training volunteers in villages in Northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent , four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without har@@ ming animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the phone &apos;s day devoted to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , whereby they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants away from their fields without damaging the elephant , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ brief@@ ing Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps cover the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bli@@ ster in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ci@@ li@@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; request - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pres@@ election as it would have requested Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; auth@@ ored his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s country selection list .
however , the country was not listed between countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel from its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ wered him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind this was even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even bigger dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a pretty big resonance in the Internet where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged aff@@ or@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code is now added .
police forces tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting bra@@ zi@@ lian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the fact that the police deployed rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s proposals by the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the protest participants could see gra@@ ff@@ iti against the temporary President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests erup@@ ted several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the previous year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies has grown strongly at businesses in the country , the ambassador announced .
Russian companies embrace existing relations with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent over the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan estimates a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , Russian foreign representation made about 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries where the number of tourists in Russia is concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year broke , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : beverage market falling in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y accident on Thursday evening has been perpet@@ rated on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the return of cash from the drink bar staff and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver VW Golf .
how much money was captured , the police don &apos;t share .
the cul@@ pr@@ its should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we Market and can be viewed badly .
after the raid on Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg , the perpetr@@ ators must be run by the car park with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
who made observations at the time of the crime ( around 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : playing and fun during summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days the children and young people of the social @-@ pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old spent their summer holidays in Nuss@@ dorf near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet zone of Hard@@ tw@@ hal@@ dle , the joyful group was lod@@ ged in during the first week of school holidays .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to B@@ enge with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
on the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s tour in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing .
both children and car@@ egi@@ vers have been indul@@ ged in culinary delights such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
workshops were made to create beautiful pieces of jewellery from pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of departure the sun was laugh@@ ing and the children and young people returned happy .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the mini @-@ stran@@ ts from the sea @-@ care unit E@@ yach@@ ts@@ @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were met together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge the time until the next Roma pilgrimage of all the mini @-@ stran@@ ts in two years , St. Anna &apos;s round of affairs decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and one finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the opened doors of mercy on Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the rooms of the sanctuary , arose .
on the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ck sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges and told the pilgrims .
from Hor@@ b , one was driven by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where there was also a Münster In@@ ser@@ er Lieben Frau and thus the pilgrimage route from Münster took place .
the individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts in the morning and in the evening .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeat@@ ed@@ ely made R@@ ast to sing together a song from specially compiled pilgri@@ m songs .
the dormit@@ ories of the local par@@ ishes were available for the overnight stays .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller were responsible for a tasty and also star@@ ving dinner and breakfast at the stage venues .
on the second day we went on to Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next step was to take the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting distance , but at first we had to cut around 500 metres altitude and then climbed again .
the deserved reward was a barbecue at the bath in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was given thanks here .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the city of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner was the last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow embark@@ ed on a pi@@ vot@@ al role that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y took to E@@ igen . the young couple took pride when he stor@@ med home to inv@@ ade New Zealand &apos;s favor@@ ites .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in spite of Ho@@ ys &apos;s res@@ ignation .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ des appeared .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scottish which has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who were victorious four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner were an Olympic ch@@ ord in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ings , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , Hin@@ des fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation while pushing in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed to the podium .
Glas@@ gow &apos;s 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and to make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic ch@@ ord in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defeated the world champi@@ ons .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he fell intentionally on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this was not a problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with the whole GB of flags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which was won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome .
with the form Kenn@@ y it is possible in the realm of possibility that he wins the victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they reached the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had fought with en@@ voy before the qualification yesterday , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand@@ ler , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a tro@@ op of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
drama in the background took place in the background , so the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April in the midst of sex and mo@@ b@@ bing alleg@@ ations and reti@@ ring of magn@@ itu@@ des like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but when you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again .
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus lifts up all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to plant the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , leading to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the Al@@ coa melt in Port@@ land lo@@ oses cash and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mol@@ ten with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AG@@ L also stated that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; that would have come into force as of November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the energy supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecast of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L informed that the value of the contracts had already depreci@@ ated in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a dis@@ miss@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said the decision to book contracts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have entered into force in November this year , even if it is still an explanation of why it has res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume about 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and a total of 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity annually .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reductions in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generating set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan , Kris is on the cover of the acclaimed September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this verse made me cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote .
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ like ? ) , craw@@ ling reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classic twist : they all have a surprise party planned .
this is the c@@ lich@@ é@@ d act of nearly every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly started .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were looking forward to seeing it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a gir@@ th resem@@ bling a band rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Ac@@ cor@@ ding to fashion@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover star is so long@@ ingly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leak@@ age before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who like &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers does not like success to everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed them and called them &quot; the dung of the moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ ed up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but walking around on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community centres annually rate 160@@ ,000 people
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s resource needs are rejected annually by the municipal centers , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further reductions on over@@ bur@@ dened transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ u@@ gi@@ ations and the like - are rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ loaded , are ready for further reductions .
as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the Director of the Municip@@ ality Centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Common Law Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people are already dismissed every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s com@@ mon@@ place centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services that you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed from del@@ u@@ sions , workers who have been dismissed un@@ just@@ ly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short @-@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the state government met its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused of recru@@ iting employee
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign was charged with alleged in@@ action after it was told that in February their campaign leader for North Carolina put a gun on a staff while they were travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i in the State Court of Charlotte , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i admitted to have waited for months to settle the issue internally before real@@ ising that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the run in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i realized that at least four other persons had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate spark@@ ed an uph@@ eav@@ al when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment people - fire@@ arms owners and arms friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was to be elected and judge .
the Tr@@ ump campaign clearly indicated that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not rise to violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ is complaint claims compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental harm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tr@@ ump press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
on calls with his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far led a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i v. Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : Federal elections pol@@ l : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to place the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD crashed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( formerly 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite slight losses , the Green Party declined by 6 percent ( before 8.@@ 7 percent ) in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent respectively .
according to the survey , the SPD &apos;s vote would only be 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it still lays behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , while the pirates would miss the entry in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia became communic@@ ator on the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ unk@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would last for approximately two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in Western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ Browser , even if agon@@ izing slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was pretty proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 Euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smart era .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story , albeit not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , vendors are domin@@ ating the market , all of whom came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that is everyday life for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphones in the world .
about 1.4 billion units were sold , Samsung and Apple account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , an entire industry has been created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , while Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all easy to use by touch screen .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the company .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad offered great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will flash on the world stage .
the doubts were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every asked question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn in economic growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and throughout the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 which was built in the midst of the two most popular run@@ ways in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , try to b@@ ypass advertising blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block indicators on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post that told users to update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network once more .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop side would change the coding for his adver@@ ts to make it difficult to detect the indication of which part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the open source community and the hang@@ ers has been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how alar@@ ming indicators for the industry have become . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook advertising revenue .
the company has put it on desktop PCs on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a spokesperson shared .
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a large share of revenues , so that Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook maintained that ads would cause new filters , because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we instead focus on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman in suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are calling witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was driven by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay down in the dark , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , wanted to kill himself by several vehicles , including a truck , himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , asking these as well as every witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible .
in either case - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs right in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent murder , having killed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the streets , took the judgment .
the judge found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who responded to an emergency call -- justified in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should contact the police in number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once lived hab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have re@@ buff@@ ed similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus displays its daylight side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution , previously suspected by planetary researchers .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billion years , was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
its oceans evapor@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations , Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
I have been thinking long and much about how I could improve this team in the summer to give it more depth , it takes it and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy was awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach in the league during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 .
he took the club to 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed out in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell by five points behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles concerning the pay for North Sea wage workers are suspended , while all parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood @-@ Field Service Provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of winding up the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop some full day sessions over the next few weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to re @-@ address the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has dismissed tens of thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler &apos;s Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rot@@ ated in con@@ stellation @-@ run to different rates and in which context the rot@@ ational periods are related to planetary creation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ouses , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars encounter large quantities of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star al@@ armed , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
much more than we would like to know more about how , when and why stars will slow down their rates of rotation , and so to speak , hang up their dancing shoes .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades &apos;s rot@@ ational rates , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star emerges
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional release , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m saying good@@ bye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) explained .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has earned him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back with performance for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 Points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Nav@@ al ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to make some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players play similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 year old should not be taken up in the bas@@ eball hall of fame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field so cont@@ ested is its appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , banned ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 he was closed to 211 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the prime suspect to have received funding from an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for many years .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said swe@@ e@@ tish back then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also its farewell days do not go no@@ is@@ elessly .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win every game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the conditions with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , gave sympathy to the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Or@@ ri@@ vals , Boston red So@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the supporters sang in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
blur@@ red : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland should not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
a wis@@ ely ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ steep@@ le hur@@ d@@ les Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - just before the start of the critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions this news is coming to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was found last Sunday , which is used as a protective agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m butterfly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the events of more than 50 m of fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ specimen and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires a full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C , but CA@@ S responsible for the san@@ ction of sports@@ men with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news le@@ aked through the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the forbidden substance is supposed to be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ rehear@@ sal is supposed to have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to the ath@@ lete with criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , approximately all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ charged nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid n@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier .
both of them deny the intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , especially the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , also the Kenya L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the former off@@ ences in China also ensured violent confron@@ tations also among athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the Po@@ dium about 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio .
sun also focused on an engagement with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , Sun had been positively tested by the Chinese Championships on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine , but only had to sit a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : h@@ ack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful in doing so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a recent survey of malware scan specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partly repeatedly victims of an attack with black@@ mailing software .
in Germany , just under 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations made by Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to earn ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes head Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the painting programmes were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
in the past few months , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks carried out rapidly in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim active , it sel@@ ectively looks for un@@ modified files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as after archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ ma@@ press .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users find the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
as a result , the damage falls when a ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt their business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , multiple hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay receive their data again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the call of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure explored the use areas and contact with black@@ mail users and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they tell their victims via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus company Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
it is more likely , however , that it is about three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ iler then seek further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies to better safeguard their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey are confident that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful closure , the perpetr@@ ators instead thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes head Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the type of data , the potential for damage is much higher than before .
in future , the perpetr@@ ators could see completely new goals on the Internet of things in the future .
on the de@@ con conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the release of such a block@@ aded heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the little HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the rear .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit @-@ top falls off .
the HR @-@ V in the storage box is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with raised back rests and 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide @-@ range re@@ vs .
however , he should do his job a bit qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is grati@@ fying .
another engine is available : a 1.5 l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City emergency brake assistant ( works until speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fern@@ light@@ assist@@ ent works very reliably .

however , full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , App integration and more .

airline is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable if there are risks that are typical of air traffic .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff had broken a cra@@ b in the fall .
the accident , however , could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
illness : when the organis@@ er pays
after their trip , ill holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests showed the same symptoms .
in the case of a negotiated case , a family was ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of her door@@ step .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective wastewater treatment plant , which supposedly had polluted sea water .
the family thought that the trip was lacking - and compla@@ ined against the organizer .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organizer only learned about it shortly before departure of the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff .
until then he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
so he has not viol@@ ated his duty of information , thus the judgment .
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , said many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber minded and determined at the same time to react to terrorist attacks .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and cle@@ av@@ age .
we will not treat this triumph to terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders need to leave the country more quickly , it increases security and strengthens the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals to the Bundestag election 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal reinforcement of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the mean four @-@ digit order of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a symp@@ a@@ thetic publicity for terrorism ought to be punished again .
CC@@ TV surveillance is to be improved , so that weapons are am@@ ended in such a way that , above all , the purchase of weapons on the internet is ham@@ pered .
the most recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors should be maintained by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions how the danger of the citizens can be reduced , he said with a view to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of concealed investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the interior minister clearly spoke against shareholders .
&quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a general ban on full @-@ wear is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t ban everything you reject and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss , Sim@@ one Peter , accused the minister of inten@@ ding to simulate the power and capacity of action with ever @-@ increasing anti @-@ terrorism packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and tightening the right of residence bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
it st@@ alls regularly on the circum@@ vention road - here a picture of November .
but this is to change : the right of law shall be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the environmental road every evening in the traffic jam when they drive over the free@@ way to the feeder ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the road construction sector extends the right @-@ off track by 700 meters between the Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
drivers can then come directly from the hammer street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is split early , which means that the overall cycle is improved on the busy section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea of the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the back@@ log goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping road and sometimes even beyond .
this is why the needle eye on the B 51 is just before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , the traffic is only ste@@ ered in one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back over a quarter of a year ago .
the reason for this is that static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to record the heavy load traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated work @-@ day traffic will last , the competent provincial company cannot say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining time until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the rule of law , the state company consciously selected the weaker time during the school holidays , because it is to be expected with disabilities .
the traffic will be on the construction site on Tuesday and on Wednesday .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the theater piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s house has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 students between 11 and 15 years visited the staging in the Little House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the framework of this project .
most of the young@@ sters of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , thus the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg of Spra@@ y@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will be able to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
given the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern a stroke in the south @-@ west Germany in the night to Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star scales are per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars .
they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes on in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening , you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer necessary to think about sleep before the alarm bells are awak@@ ened .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders appear ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders and there can be many reasons behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter B@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
what you understand for the time being , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , thus an inhal@@ ing and dor@@ man@@ t distur@@ b@@ ance .
many people feel uns@@ atis@@ fying or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German home@@ workers association with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
sleep disorder is often an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors condition each other .
for example , anyone who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disk failure can be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and starts to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , gives you an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I have sleep problems with the doctor ?
who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor .
the draw@@ back can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
in order to relieve the sleep disorder , it is important to find out its causes .
the treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or even drugs - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
the resident sleep physician barely exists in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleeping problems , you should first contact your family doctor .
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep and what happens there ?
for example , in the case of snor@@ ing with breathing pro@@ positions , doctors recommend to study in the sleep laboratory , in case of ill @-@ fatigue , for sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare yourself for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ inging , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping @-@ ends .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
what counts is : regular sleep and stand @-@ up times , do not sleep long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start to expect immediately , and that is totally not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has to have with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he took gold at the Doh@@ a Short @-@ track World Championships for the first time and at the same time set up its first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his former ex @-@ team @-@ mates , protecting him from his criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € award and a jungle of € 150@@ ,000 no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page during the night .
the transport system in swimming is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even run on the topic of dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ dre would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you may not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger who meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : baggage theft gang arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the police officers of the Düsseldorf police succeeded in the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects committed several pockets and baggage theft as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30@@ h , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to the police from past anti @-@ theft events .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and were in a collective , cooperative and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the Crime Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ al 34 can prove four acts to thi@@ eves who had travelled to Germany in order to prevent criminal off@@ ences .
in total , they had over 15,000 Euros in total .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in between a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like this , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a Bi@@ ol@@ aden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone has spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demol@@ ished , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 .
in recent weeks , however , article about this &quot; trendy city district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is prefer@@ enti@@ ally illustrated by burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants have rental agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially Berlin &apos;s internal sen@@ ator Henkel has campaig@@ ned for a cra@@ ck@@ down police action against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ ro@@ uted for three weeks official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , closed off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , the building workers were renovated in order of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and one day later police and construction workers removed from the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk vor@@ m late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who raised three children here , are especially anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects , they share the concern of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , which mostly wanted police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police force between house @-@ occup@@ iers and their neighbours , does not exist so clearly .
Friedrichsha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which even today compared to the rest of the city , has a lower average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost all of the Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized by the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world . residents of GDR times and former household members share their neighbourhood with them .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on thrown discs or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year so often together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as physical injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes make det@@ ri@@ ments that tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rented house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
when it comes to violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbors , they haven &apos;t been .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the architect @-@ architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here you can help one another , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn to the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse - and remained .
that is why it was so important to her that the residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly demanded the interpretation sovereignty over the bor@@ ough in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former building gaps that supp@@ ress the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is ultimately fre@@ ehold flats , which are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well contaminated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what can you do if someone never ends ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for Zu@@ zo@@ omed , who anno@@ y about colour bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who draw , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area , can complain badly about noise there .
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be called by their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the new refugee advisor
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Agency for Ur@@ bach .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups , refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine client from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ice cream mil@@ ky , which has a problem above all .
thus some - less mo@@ cking than rather aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job .
looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , an em@@ power@@ ing Woll@@ mer@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , meaning Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organizing , working with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human , and communication problems .
new containers will soon be available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection support .
you must place the refugees in rented or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
responsibility changes from the coun@@ cill@@ or &apos;s office to the municipality and the job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
it does not work so far , whether you depend on private apartments , so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be in@@ famous as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be put up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but it is not only with apartments .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be swept or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it needs special offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here also the administration and honorary official jump .
it is essential that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
anyone who eventually gets the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority were motivated .
the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two after the recent events fear ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine said quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some might call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk can and doesn &apos;t want to exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins put it completely in retri@@ eval .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so Haupt@@ - and honorary officers have to look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they have always been in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly is the policy .
actually it is unfair to put them on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees who would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 persons , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars with helicop@@ ters sought

the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , argu@@ ably mas@@ ked , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies .
they fled towards the city centre .
in order to ins@@ ure the police , the police deployed several expe@@ ditions as well as a police helicopter .
