<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer and some colleagues looked for a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpiles" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses recalled at their celebrations, they chased home to the feeding troughs in the fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And that ended the riding career again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even hover for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and with that at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the context of a small gala, German sports aid handed over the Golden Mountain Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of honours for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already adored him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential candidates are undivided in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively lag behind regulators, and he will be strong for a far-reaching fiscal reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, states that the state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore the taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In need of investment, pump and Clinton are almost silent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate is announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, impartial discussions could come to trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-ride coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement wants to cancel it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand the renewable energy with its investment program:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they simply want to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid even better, says Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens, stands for boosting growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics considered him that the budget deficit would only be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fowl.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs organised the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believes that when they arrive in Germany, the end is irre, Bahr tells.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and abused at worst.</seg>

<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">Some with no answer to the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for instance, there is no such thing in the housing of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Swabia alone, only winged women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, lower and middle-Franconia there are only for single women and their children in some common shelters or houses.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputies of the Assistant Doctors have called on their union to approve new labour measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more operational measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers would have agreed to address the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistance physicians and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the President of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" "" "persistently quiet" "" "to problems, leading to the rejection of the treaty." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara would most want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile appeared narrowly and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report a whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper wrote that Erdogan could have behaved as if something bad happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's shining, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the launch of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at that time was rage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the cousins is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted assault on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he was relieved last month in a failed coup d "état of almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which every year typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television endorsed cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed to be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti put it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the ongoing anger on the slugs emptier of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian head of state gained a bonus for claiming support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present, as an analyst once described to me, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel ill and badly treated by the West and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks the two presidents said at the press conference that they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey purposely avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to underline them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should at least talk to one another.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fires chief of staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">For many years IVANOV was part of the closest confidence circle of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement by the Kremlin, it is said that Putin has ordered" "" "dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration without giving reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin, it is said (in Russian) that he later served as Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think that it is the government's main task to support your activity as head of state in terms of bills and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and Vaino recommended his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convinced?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has encircled Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putins for a long time and works like him for the Soviet Intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff reluctantly resigned.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once touted as a potential president, at one time would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "in his remarks on Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said" "" "it's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining post for four years." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV adopted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another supportive ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The €1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensland crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blowers" "", "which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incline ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The €1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Minister of Economy Keith Brown gave a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to move from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queenshrnet crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the final section of the deck is now getting a gong for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking construction and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower in the expansion, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or east side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs around 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and Greens mean: investors should be more strongly involved in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD suggests a" "" "action concept living" "" "at the next council session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said SPD leader Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be built on stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">The big issue in the town hall is, however, as Bratmann: "how to deal with investors who want to build on private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development program, which will cost millions of dollars and needs to be financed, is to provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem is:" "" "there is no agreement between the factions right now." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to provide investors with as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, so violently, there is an intensification of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is still not complete: the 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do we compensate for the loss of more about 1300 favorable apartments whose promotion will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planned political spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be bought from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back into the price range.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of the year, deadlines lie in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 homes one could get back to the price fixing for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically once more, it is removed from the goal of so-called confusion.</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few neighbourhoods will no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens are counting on the fact that there will be even more movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "group leader Holger Herlitschke believes:" "" "the CDU must go into the boat for a broad majority." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside but prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens was complained by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games, and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters created for video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand overloaded by the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the delusion and jumped up for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person restores each day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardistin, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of subsequent people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health people want to" "" "take 30 minutes of time" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "" "hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people looking miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sport reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also crumbling game spoils that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they did not give us reason to do sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now the Olympic champion at last.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast invaded the title on Thursday and magnified the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team ameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American Women Simone Biles performs on the Swedish bar during the single multi-campaign event of women in the gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a winning title and in total the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey ended at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years its sport, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou bailon told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American Women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in single multi-campaign women in the gymnastics at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell celebration of the retired Team Coordinator Martha Karolyi served as exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Bill insisted on having never planned the future during her long journey, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - containing their typical Tumbling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school flight in the gymnasium, in which Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost any competition for the competition, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina was guided by two turns, the picture vanished.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish bar and ground floor - in which Biles holds the world title - lautered.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered with 15,433 on the balance beam again - and sat on it with a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her denial - pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake passed to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time, the 22-year-old team captain, called" "" "Oma" "", "had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her wordling, she cast the hands of the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the fast-spreading tweet of the 19-year-old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence that they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Heavy rainfalls, flooding gives cause for rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi</seg>
<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the southeast Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded its banks and threatened with large flooding after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that inquiries for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that alone the commune of Tangipahoa would have requested tens of thousands of sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In southern Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood a lot of houses near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas over the beaten rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams always picked up people from the flood water in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those who were rescued by Gloster on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally located more than 400 feet away from his house, greatly heightened overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another son's son who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "we woke up and the water flowed and poured in," "" "said Hansford." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer had rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated by Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said that the flooding had" "" "spread rapidly" "", "as there continued heavy rainfalls and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer moved close to Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said the rain has been significantly outweighed by the rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities indicated that heavy rainfalls and road flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the excursion into five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an ordered subsidiary in Tangipahoa attacked 200 houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which were now both flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of Robby Miller's municipality said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets which were washed by flood.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the towns of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuations.</seg>
<seg id="31">"as soon as the water begins to return, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the high water and sandbags made available to the residents to take the water from their homes and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the last great flood we had was in March," "" "said Lacy Landrum of the city administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said that it was raining on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his statements, a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be inundated, but no reports were reported on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I have seen water in places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it is still coming."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympiads in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been there since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turnerds, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, the Catholic, rounds off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one of female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymnastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see gymnastics across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all fought the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will have only four turrets in the team. also, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts mainly in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents for training, orientation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in prosperous suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both her athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to aun countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy-to-access exercise.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable turnes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that earn the opportunity to learn and to benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that attracts thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the wood of the Olympic team golds and thanks, that you are motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes by talks hit the government on reluctance and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="16">In the last two months we talked to the assistant doctor of the assistance doctors and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to the concerns about tutelage and whistle-blowings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a professional period, training lists, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training vacations and the gender-specific wage gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, the Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreement with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anti-inflammatory drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that constitute floorings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots that caches blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="11">Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having a further risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft Recommendation of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underlined his immune system and sanitation of a serious test by leaking up some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook his course on a euro ticket, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a washing button of a draw toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before decking each object he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to get.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment that was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "" "brought some surprising results to daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to lick the rinsing button of a traction toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task put his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said," "" "As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test screed showed a luminescence of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to that, the luminous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick off after its luminometry number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of Dairy Products Valio produced the travel film" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," "" "which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick it here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company is equipping Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explaining the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended that we said" "" "Let's call Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of gastrointestinal bacteria and 58 percent said that they would at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asoziale family left its social dwelling after a delogivation with a loss of £50,000 because it had terrorized its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltaso, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had plastered holes, wooden boards were torn, trash was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer repairing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I believe that people don't have to live this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, strife and flooding.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors testified that they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called on the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing led her and her partner forcibly from the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said their life was being made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They were not killing anyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>

<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now, where they are finally gone, it will become beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, testified that the family would have agreed to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house to which the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years long.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the church building trash and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the lessee agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a deletion is always the final step into consideration of Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message communicates that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloxing on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as balances, paraphernia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was given a fine after she had found herself guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial law.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a grave of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, it was assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were graffiti coated.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police tells them that they will navigate renters who do not abide by the rules of the house</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall informed that the Delogierung was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not obey the rules of the house.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach, and those who have been harmed by such behaviour," "" "she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC wants to establish a disciplinary committee in such a case.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenyas athletes face the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud control in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a trainer to Kenya.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee decided to immediately establish a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan functionary told that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter-Letter Ferguson Roter.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF world association has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to exert their own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson shared.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "depending on the results of the investigation and the following IOC measures, IAAF will evaluate an assessment," "" "said it in an IAAF statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and spent himself as Ferguson Roti, released and signed the test," explained Kenias Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti-doping agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Roti was in 2015 in Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is reported to have informed athletes of his country about pending doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was said to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">After numerous doping offences in Kenya, Kenya has been under special observation for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the announcement of more than 2000 doping target controls submitted by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was uncommon to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted much pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic beginning.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, WADA Kenya has taken off from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the WADA rules.</seg>

<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of TV reports of the ARD, accusations have been raised again and again in Kenya that doping agents are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports betrugs.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had employed in the Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">In doing so, it was possible to prove that this type of sport has been systematically and systematically doped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't receive anything from the summer campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the country election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament decided already at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because it's not stupid to date: summer holidays, heat and land-day swaggering - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not a native, so do not choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers, the posters hang up, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and counting voices in the end, just laboriously drive out.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the electoral and the last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to make an election campaign close to the people once again.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition matter.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign, one can see from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the land, distributes roses and chat a bit with the people, just as it did his legendary, word-like predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Apart from that, he has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel is responsible for the flowering of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We create this" "" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make an election campaign at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations twice; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it was probably the majority of other federal states," "" "accused Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, even Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of malls with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, according to Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that on the ground, you crumble the base that it must exert a lot to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the council of the CDU campaigner Kokert at his co-workers is also self-revealing:" "" "they have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called its SPD a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the polls, the Socialists and Democrats Group last dropped 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election in 2011, the SPD won a clear victory of 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They are making a modern virtue out of their holiday needs and largely postponed their election campaign to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online campaign" "", "she calls the president Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise green campaigners engage in search of traces of local vocal chords among the vacationers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvts just with a houseboat through the mecklenburgian lakes and also finds it beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>

<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>

<seg id="8">It will also be praised for the coming up of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation entrances.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Aspergroute in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg has returned, the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed.</seg>

<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there have been some considerable discomfort," "" "says the deputy chief conductor Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachelstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping routes were seeking and rather trusted their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to a failure of some trucks in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not met, the municipality also called for Mössingen's measuring vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable overrides," says King, who made himself knowledgeable on the spot.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businesspeople at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg now the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 redevelopment has led to revenue outbreaks, everyone who is asked to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="26">The most exploited is the local area along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it "hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "the road renovation was" "" "thrown back for two years" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other farms where so much more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family business has been here since 1715, refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are now seeing less frequently due to complicated traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive down, it's also elsewhere nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family-clientele has returned to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and a bird flu Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis which has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="11">After the latest attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière gave a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for the security of the Republic.</seg>

<seg id="14">"" "" "" "nor is it the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines on air passenger data and weapons legislation." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière is launching a second attempt on proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and knock jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "this will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "says the CDU man." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But he still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that doesn't have any chances in the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he plans rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones in advance and use social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately discard their papers in order to obscure their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some also have an unbalanced effect and leaves questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to argue that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">Moreover, in view of the high levels of refugees, many people were worried about safety.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that the people profoundly occupied did not let themselves be clung out in election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has moved tremendously into focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>

<seg id="37">First a garnered dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the chiefs also demand a burka ban and a return from the dual citizenship.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Thursday, head of banking, Josef Paul, said: "it's only about 139 customers who can park 40 million euros on giro- or daily money accounts."</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "the Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it:" "" "normal savers are not afraid to pay criminal charges for their austerity measures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">If banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty.</seg>
<seg id="5">This fee requires the Raiffeisen Bank Gmund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euros to cash or daily money accounts.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the first 100,000 euros are free."</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "the next 100.000 costs will be 400 euros a year in the future," "" "said Paul." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">For some time now, he skipped 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs," "" "said the Head of the Bank." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "I can't lay down for every million 4000 euros." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the polluter-pays principle, the costs now pass on.</seg>
<seg id="12">Leaving the cash simply in the Raiffeisenbank safes would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't like the fifth!," said the Bank Board.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most customers would have understood and changed to other types of investment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only a few migrated to other banks.</seg>

<seg id="17">Some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees, credit cards or bank transfers.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Thuringian economy and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land with its Skatbank branch in 2014 made headlines with punches for deposits of three million euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Michael Kemmer, head of the banking union, said:" "" "we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits, the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="23">Well-known actors, sportsmen and entrepreneurs live in the region.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "there are currently no further banks known as" "" "Bayern" "", "which charge a compensation for deposits of private customers," "" "said spokesman Ernst." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanks and Raiffeisenbanken (BPR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared at the end of June: "the threshold to go into the negative is very, very high."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged loves plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you make haste to comment under the pseudonym of NonAlleconia's middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed re-emergence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horror by amateur collectors - it has an emotional impact: older record buyers rather keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, take a modest grey suit and stay wild before I stop, hold my hands and say something like this: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - still there is a handful of fantastic plate specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, the I of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of middle age, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 slabs.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot via e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and buy items that he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things where I probably was too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and add:" "" "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the Yougv profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pe, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar silencers, from objects that evoke happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be a void of emptiness or possessions of material possessions as a sort of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a collector for me and I think it's like that for many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee bursts out of a stack of boards." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month had not yet heard of it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I look through a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just recently entered here and said:" I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead LP, so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older people who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the record to almost a whole floor, has a lively audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest Synthesizer- and sextet Pop instead of experimental jazz moans from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but emotional traumas are hard to detectable when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She is more like a shopping mannequin than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." "" "it casts off with a dearaged sigh." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I am giving the impression to wear jeans in jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov agree, they are not considered, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their thursday morning with security not with strolling through record stores on Berwick Street and the leaves by plates while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old erroneous host who raises no unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional transactions in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which afford a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the government-backed union and other groups would not provide sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decreed that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were "absolutely trackable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is generally operated and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it meant that the closure was" "" "for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two relief organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation speed measurer: in different federal states, among others in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash units are tested, which are intended to transfer speed units very effectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used at accident points, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed polishing, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary blaster for keeping speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">But a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can also be detected simultaneously across multiple tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as access bans by time, travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a state-of-the-art condition, the trailer can be fitted with any car with trailer hitch according to the manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not simply stowed, it is lowered in the measurement mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and by the way also bullet-proof outer cover.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the glitter against vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to data from Vitronic in different federal states and is now also used.</seg>
<seg id="13">Also foreign authorities are flashing with the new technology: recently, France has ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-er Rugby ended on Thursday evening with an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji granted a master class in handling, side-stepping, back press, line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medallist of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they proposed New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in its best form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't be - that at least one Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderfull and made the attacks of GBs from fun bouncing.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one were running in driving coaches. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau passed over in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With more than four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">An honorable Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touch-down in the right corner and stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak Tactics of the GB team and stormed down to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play 7, while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB performed basic changes at half-time and closed the fijiang gap... for a total of four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua passed away from Fiji after a brilliant incident.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Seas, whose fans sang, flags wave and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff sounded, the Fijis embraced and GB kicked crushingly in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a short half-finals match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boks in the first half forward, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and with that the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fight with the trainer's cancer for a rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinalieres gold than with these games and that wants something to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard hit, which enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only the two who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was omnipresent when they rowed to the second Olympiad in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports who set such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39.ter unconditional deployment, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and no one was helpful than the trainer who didn't know 30 months ago if he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risked.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operated and that did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve-growing morning with something more than anything else to talk and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning who was as captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan said," "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's maybe a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I have worked for, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have liked a better person to train or have a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena bellver and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very much at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "pale in the process, stay in the process."</seg>

<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who has been in the purpose-association for 31 years, 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and there are always new things added because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity promotion are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the renewable energy environment in the constituents of the so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic statement with the European Commission after talks with commissioner-designate Margrethe Vestager.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has accompanied her entire life: as a young girl she was in the school choir and in the Lehramt studies she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "singing moves me - emotional and physical," "" "she describes." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says of the German seniors "league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, senior citizens can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to talk and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this purpose seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly challenge their lungs will not get out of the powder in everyday life too quickly.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In elderly people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the German Association of Senior Citizens "Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the shared singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs arouses many memories with older people, often linked to positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia sometimes devise themselves to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is required for the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing at the same time on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone are practicing to concentrate not only on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The feeling of self-esteem is also growing through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing are enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior benchmark, one can easily connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs may also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you feel like singing, you should join a choir, "Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="3">To their surprise, the mistrust also did not leave the males cold - however, they always remained the same in contrast to the females.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records don't always determine the headlines at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia swam so slow that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures.</seg>

<seg id="6">In social networks, Habasit became the viral internethit.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his first course with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather not his athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24 year old participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start-up right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more popular.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most sportsmen run in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different.</seg>

<seg id="1">As of October 1, 2016, the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 3.44 instead of 2,10 Euro for the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welshole 3,44; for allowtenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 Euro (previously 2,26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (up to now 2,18 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the household by the District Office Kulmbach, it was noted that subcoverings have been used for this sewage treatment plant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal principles, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens and industrial and industrial companies from Welfare, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">Revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented the board, a re-calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over and under covers from the preceding period of calculations are to be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained that all three waste water systems were relatively small, with a very low waste water drop, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the past period of the calculation, all three installations were not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses to a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welsh, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that in the waste water plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">The almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up in the pump station. after nearly 20 years of operation, the first clarification pond had to be postponed, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued support and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs which were considerably below the current level in the previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the small sewage treatment in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were "fully beat."</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt, the market community of major entertainment costs in wastewater facilities, has been spared in the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the opinion of stone houses, the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water association could not be extended because these facilities are deficient institutions.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a painting from a Roy Lichtenstein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are non-flowery, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriages reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past, in which they were accused of promoting Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "when this week some users proposed a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" "" "yellowtail" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves if these repeated controversies referred to a major problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage was widely spread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism resembled the filter of injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely used over the photographs, wrote that the filter was "hurting and flaunting."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effect.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been moved into the degrading extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride of stumbling.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>

<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the modelling practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leaders and finished their article with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>

<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>

<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in CentCom are reaching the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government leaders have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of the Congress were much more positive than the facts," "" "concluded the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom affiliated publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>

<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command has changed intelligence reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of CentCom reports is underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-ranking democrats in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "damaged the morals among analysts and" "" "disproportionately little room for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at CentCom analysts regarding a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General inspector who was taken up by CentCom analyst complaints.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the former government under George W. Bush faced only a small occupation force in Iraq, and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, states that contrary to the statements made by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after shooting three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American Feldhockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Britons on the first place, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take the strong Dutchman a bit longer from the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game happens on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising host through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in three years she had a hockey player in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a setback from the area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into play without a win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and leaped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events are constant and inevitable, a furious relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning bar, which is handed down to triathletes by the crossbow guard to the swimmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Legruy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who was for the first time at the Olympics and a flock of women with dimple, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports which are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should have a decent argument for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although jumping on a trampoline has been an olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparsely aware that many of the people I had surveyed did not know that there is an olympia port at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians that for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear to a clownsschule as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humoristic potential - the cartoonical trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish tableland, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging conquerors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to face a number of falling movements (turning, pike and lettos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are rated according to the official Olympic programme according to the design, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must go farther, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also a further highlight in television transmission: the world or the Olympians of the Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as a bit tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final round of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time, which the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the end hours as part of a nighttime block on both days starting at 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia-Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear of man and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base after air.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police when switching to firing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continued to suppress the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven to the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely critical vote last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades, who were forced more or less in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of the onset of Hinköcheln under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media since cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians came to protest against the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of time, the Amhara, who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high-lands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, accounting for around 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate enemies and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemaram Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">In contrast to Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North-Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which according to analysts were apparently messed up by the government and stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this did not prevent the intensification of the internal depletion of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it accepts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray became more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The US government used Ethiopia as the base for Dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, even if she recently announced that she closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains Obama's claim that ISIS was founded was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump, on Friday, tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings with it his fellow campaigners who endeavour to take him in protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump regained in reference to the allegation on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to signify that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation perfectly serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism confronts Mr. Trump, while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign due to declining survey values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump again tried to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later on he explained, "Of course, I thought that sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans how they arrive, and then" clarify "according to what the reaction fails." Ruth Sherman said, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more corrosive tone as his survey values have continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading edge in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump has brought his loyal followers into the uncomfortable situation to be faced with, regardless of how provocative his statements might be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, gave great effort to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CNN interview.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries," "" "said Mr. Giuliani to the accuracy of Mr. Trump's assertions, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them hind legs, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he drew the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton had served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread herself by subjecting the situation in the Middle East in an aggressive way.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ahead of the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as only a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a foggy café in Williamsburg, in which one could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were ousted from Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The business Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local residents used it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabool wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, then it is also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new club has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafe, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office, he was excited to do so, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, retained a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese, and there are garnishes such as capers and saute onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "many old customers were also driven by Prizes from Williamsburg," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg, and visited the verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the club closed, she gave up the coffee drinking a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it became clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture in the club that I liked," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now they drink coffee again, even if they ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coffees, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a further long and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and invariably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I came to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and take up new ingredients in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal is still receiving his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hair usually comes to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an examination aboard the research ship Sanna, this shark was allowed to return to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims at a mere 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's sharks only get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland shark swims at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour it is on average just 1.220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This slowness-shaped lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal Science "at least from a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "says Alexander Scheuerbare of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist presumed long that Greenland's hair becomes stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, finally they mainly live in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow-serpentines measured her, when she outfitted six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Still, this sharks do this sharks: researchers found the remains of a seal in the stomach of an animal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cadavers, which torpedo from higher water-strata.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland shark, who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest shark measured 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when atomic weapons grabbed larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal, with a length of 220 centimeters, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lentils all larger Greenland-arks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14-amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 watch showed a 493 cm long Greenland shark at the age of 335, while the record Hai with 502 centimetres is even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandshark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now researchers of length have been able to classify an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals stood at the threshold of the sexually mature with 392 centimetres and was determined at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland's hair obviously allows at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This would also be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methane emits live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, whose bacon stuck on the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught up in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">They then mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerbare.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources more in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and one finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the opened doors of mercy on Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the rooms of the sanctuary, arose.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the evening before, Pastor Storck sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimages and told the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, one was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there was also a Münster Inserer Lieben Frau and thus the pilgrimage route from Münster took place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts in the morning and in the evening.</seg>

<seg id="11">The dormitories of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were responsible for a tasty and also starving dinner and breakfast at the stage venues.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner was the last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow embarked on a pivotal role that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy took to Eigen. the young couple took pride when he stormed home to invade New Zealand's favorites.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of Hoys's resignation.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hindes appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scottish which has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who were victorious four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner were an Olympic chord in the qualifying rounds, but in the standings, the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, Hindes fell short, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation while pushing in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">Glasgow's 23-year-old Skinner said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm only here to do my best and to make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic chord in the Endrunde and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he fell intentionally on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this was not a problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindes said:" "" "it feels like London with the whole GB of flags." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it is possible in the realm of possibility that he wins the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy who was born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the Sprint which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hindes said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They reached the destination in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought with envoy before the qualification yesterday, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shandler, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a troop of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama in the background took place in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April in the midst of sex and mobbing allegations and retiring of magnitudes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But when you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus lifts up all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to plant the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 workstations - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmelzer, leading to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Alcoa melt in Portland looses cash and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium molten with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting" "", "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL also stated that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions" that would have come into force as of November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," "" "said the energy supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecast of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL informed that the value of the contracts had already depreciated in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a dismissal."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said the decision to book contracts," "" "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "" "is not affected." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force in November this year, even if it is still an explanation of why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume about 600 megawatts and a total of 900 megawatts of electricity annually.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Kris is on the cover of the acclaimed September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this verse made me cry," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashian-like?), crawling reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular Showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), which ends with a classic twist: they all have a surprise party planned.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the clichéd act of nearly every birthday episode of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly started.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were looking forward to seeing it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most popular edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a girth resembling a band rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is so longingly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leakage before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years there were clearly more "celebrities who like" as "models that are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners does not like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jenners's position in the world of fashion was always tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them "the dung of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings coed up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But walking around on the Missmut seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all your sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells pictures of Cindy Crawfords's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time she is in reality TV. presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have rebuffed similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus displays its daylight side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution, previously suspected by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years, was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old occupied the fourth place in the finals over 100 m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the events of more than 50 m of freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: hackers blackmail their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware scan specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partly repeatedly victims of an attack with blackmailing software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, just under 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware-blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations made by Malwarebytes to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to earn ransom is significantly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes head Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the painting programmes were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the past few months, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks carried out rapidly in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim active, it selectively looks for unmodified files such as Word-, Excel or database files, as well as after archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmapress.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">As a result, the damage falls when a ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt their business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, multiple hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "do not pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay receive their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the call of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure explored the use areas and contact with blackmail users and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They tell their victims via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus company Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware around within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely, however, that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailer then seek further hackers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies to better safeguard their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey are confident that Ransomware can be able to repel ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful closure, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes head Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could see completely new goals on the Internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the decon conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the release of such a blockaded heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the little HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a mini van.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit-top falls off.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V in the storage box is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "it is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l with raised back rests and 1026 l, but there is the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide-range revs.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do his job a bit quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another engine is available: a 1.5 l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be somewhat more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the tested top variant" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the City emergency brake assistant (works until speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "when maneuvering." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The Fernlightassistent works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the smart speed controller reacts to the traffic sign detection and throttles the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, App integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI jack lie under the armrest and are therefore somewhat difficult to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, you roll around eternally, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer necessary to think about sleep before the alarm bells are awakened.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders appear?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Beß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand for the time being, however, is the Insomnia, thus an inhaling and dormant disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people feel unsatisfying or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German homeworkers association with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sleep disorder is often an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common in case of depression," "" "says Weep." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, anyone who has a herniated disk failure can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and starts to pondering about everyday problems and worries, gives you an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I have sleep problems with the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The drawback can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or even drugs - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">The resident sleep physician barely exists in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleeping problems, you should first contact your family doctor.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the case of snoring with breathing propositions, doctors recommend to study in the sleep laboratory, in case of ill-fatigue, for sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare yourself for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietz." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After clinging, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping-ends.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">What counts is: regular sleep and stand-up times, do not sleep long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the watch at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is totally not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="5">At 21.30h, civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to the police from past anti-theft events.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July and were in a collective, cooperative and particularly professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Crime Commissarial 34 can prove four acts to thieves who had travelled to Germany in order to prevent criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">In total, they had over 15,000 Euros in total.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between a rest of cobblestones: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a Bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone has sprayed on the façade of a grey house" "" "ugly!" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In comparison to a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">In recent weeks, however, article about this "trendy city district," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is preferentially illustrated by burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants have rental agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially Berlin's internal senator Henkel has campaigned for a crackdown police action against the project, the area called "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, the police patrouted for three weeks official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, closed off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the building workers were renovated in order of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and one day later police and construction workers removed from the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk vorm late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who raised three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house-projects, they share the concern of increasing rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, which mostly wanted police protection against vandaliating left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police force between house-occupiers and their neighbours, does not exist so clearly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which even today compared to the rest of the city, has a lower average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all of the Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized by the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world. residents of GDR times and former household members share their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on thrown discs or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year so often together with the words" "" "left autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes such as physical injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes make detriments that tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rented house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">When it comes to violence, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbors, they haven't been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect-architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here you can help one another, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn to the Rigaer Strasse - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important to her that the residents get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly demanded the interpretation sovereignty over the borough in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former building gaps that suppress the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "this is ultimately freehold flats, which are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well contaminated," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "but what can you do if someone never ends?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for Zuzoomed, who annoy about colour bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw, should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area, can complain badly about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the Refugee Agency for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working groups, refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the ice cream milky, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less mocking than rather aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, an empowering Wollmerchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, meaning Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organizing, working with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "said Regine client that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human, and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection support.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must place the refugees in rented or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility changes from the councillor's office to the municipality and the jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work so far, whether you depend on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings must be infamous as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be put up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is not only with apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be swept or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "reports Regine client." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homework, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it needs special offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also the administration and honorary official jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is essential that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone who eventually gets the feeling that he can't help in Urbach can't work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority were motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after the recent events fear radicalization, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine said quite clearly," "" "what some might call naive." "" "a residual risk can and doesn't want to exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins put it completely in retrieval.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So Haupt- and honorary officers have to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly is the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "" "Annika Deuschle says." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees who would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 persons, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
