Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement and T@@ eher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
in the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal with the Iranian nuclear program , promoted by Obama , has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech before the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront against Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election forthcoming in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to stress that his &quot; cute dog &quot; was still alive and probably ag@@ itated , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone .
inside the house , the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ce and a hand @-@ written note , which was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ sig@@ nor Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emer@@ gen@@ cies at some point after it .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb accepted life when the police en@@ ra@@ ged him .
one day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motiv@@ ating .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were happy about their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously requested the Delta State University for health reasons and told him that he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later when he went back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ ane Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , who has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
he obtained his doctorate in spring in pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the baking stone house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both appeared three years ago on a summer fair .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ce Night in the night of September 5th for the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ize game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar programme and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the ma@@ iden watch , while the Univers@@ it@@ ch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that in his emergency call , he called Pr@@ enti@@ a his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas seasonal employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees increases from October to December .
during the holidays even months are removed , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to fur@@ nish stores with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it seems to me that I am a simulated pe@@ ek and a length of arm away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; Un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN chief once again ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
B@@ an told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of meeting the Assembly of Ministers still this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria that they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Re@@ quired values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in poll@@ s , it does not work ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national poll@@ s showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the electoral period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom also won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ ump &apos;s stamina and start dropping their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
the popularity of the tr@@ umps has turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they would either be &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see Tr@@ ump temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they put up their money hats , Republi@@ can voters consider Tr@@ ump to be real .
when asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans were gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump hits almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field will probably contribute to Tr@@ ump &apos;s leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have given their votes firmly .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of tr@@ ump @-@ critical His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently will do .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new maximum levels .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa reported two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans were frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can Congress , 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ itely anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a roof@@ top house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places of residence , however , the price is just like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros ni@@ x - per square meter .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here exceptionally not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record Champion Olympic champion in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry ( 8@@ 9. ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
at his 28th place in the Champions League , Müller was rewarded with the help of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left a f@@ lange of the world champion as a f@@ lange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the Royal Class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offensive efforts they often went to work .
the attacks were often initiated at the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely interrupted by O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i from the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field hit the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown defeated the pol@@ o of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the Tor@@ wart Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arian rose to their usual dominant game , Pir@@ äus was able to set con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous stit@@ ches .
but on keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved .
so , for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ a over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola brought a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after finishing training , said sports officer Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something else , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first change , guar@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , Müller continued with an El@@ f@@ meter .
before the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of war@@ med Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently provoked the parti@@ sans of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich @-@ based tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was transported injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of ren@@ unciation , the risk decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is a result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
root causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ y infections in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of dental c@@ aries .
people who quit smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could , however , take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment falls back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must persu@@ ade people to become a non @-@ smo@@ ker , &quot; said director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and containers and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health until old age .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness have been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists hail the rem@@ nants of the late Anti@@ quity at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the last time .
near the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department for archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third phase of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists have now found their way .
from text documents it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church steep@@ le , a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs was discovered , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
after a young woman is un@@ happy at the station in the Gei@@ sel@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the local people for help .
early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 hrs the woman crossed the track towards the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , she has carried out he@@ avi@@ est injuries by collecting the train .
it was treated in emergency by emergency and brought to a hospital by ambul@@ ance personnel .
about the reason of the ni@@ gh@@ tly crossing of the trail of the young woman there are no findings from the investig@@ ative officials .
the incident was probably observed by witnesses or residents heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
local residents or pass@@ ers by Lin@@ der@@ ner Rail@@ ways , Ziegel@@ bä@@ cks@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .

EU Commission proposes new trial in dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to resolve the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement ( TT@@ IP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private mediation devices for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which in its operation corresponds to considerably more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström on the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US jointly selected independent judges for a new investment court .
they should come from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time a second instance is fores@@ een .
it would allow it to appeal against judgement .
until now , the parties involved agreed upon refer@@ ees to one another , and there was no possibility of enti@@ t@@ lement to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice did not trust , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work for an international investment court according to his own data .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
the Investor @-@ State Disp@@ ute Sett@@ lements ( IS@@ DS ) , mainly demanded by large corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary that allows tax pa@@ yers to vote for national laws or to push through a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act referred to the Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they are not to apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Minister of Economic Affairs Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government , too , welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European corporate association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against restric@@ ting the legal action of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already stand at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is deemed to be no longer durable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sat on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the shy @-@ looking folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about various places he always records on the map , about his meti@@ culous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they have ar@@ isen and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer .
with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs , harmon@@ i@@ ously harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , can drift into excell@@ ently opul@@ ently at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should be cast in succession .
but already in 2004 and in the Rhine near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive outlook .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live is enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
finishing with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any year list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens will then rely on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) with very extensive electronic articles .
this sixth full studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
from a long time to the smaller clubs , the stage shows are here for the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark @-@ kept ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly converted St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without judging a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
only at an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens hum@@ bles himself , plays only a few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister &apos;s question
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s question was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s question and for the first time with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to set the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , and his performance by the media is likely to be examined by the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; fewer theaters and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has provoked criticism by a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several titles in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour MPs set out to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is a T@@ ory leader across the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament over the last decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who promised another policy paper says he has given &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are at odds with the prime minister , and that he will refrain from both &quot; ki@@ ck@@ ness &quot; and the dispute with resistance and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow of Economic Minister , is represented if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is traveling abroad .
he also initiated the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch and Ju@@ dy Theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the frame was viewed by the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and would require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the UK
at the same time , the FT@@ SE 100 was boo@@ sted by the bid target SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was the fastest and most exhaus@@ tive assessment over the time of an increase in interest rates since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over of the rival company AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
Gl@@ en@@ core &apos;s shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set out his assessment for R@@ ating .
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % following a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs for his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .

&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a had to sit in the tenth grade in grammar school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fill her with a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
school duty ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also be@@ aver not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the advertising tru@@ ce of the Super@@ market he collected three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company was fl@@ ush@@ ing many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber vou@@ chers .
and with every doll which looks like him and about the counter , Bi@@ eber himself collects .
when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , you are amazed at the window screen .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e is too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that Bi@@ eber is in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to No. 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to the idea of potato plan@@ ers
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - and indeed in the potato plan@@ ter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ ant Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the expression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato@@ el instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he saw by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a grill sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes , rot@@ ates in his shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multi@@ cul@@ tur@@ alism for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has now to be submitted to the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he thinks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ cash starts Boden@@ stan@@ dig Camp@@ aig@@ n to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ dependence
Met@@ rad tries to protect the I@@ GA stores from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump aboard , with brands like ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell bil@@ lowed tickets for the South Australian So@@ ccer League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices goes through its annual investor strategy day .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that , twelve months after the opening of its first markets , Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two states and will remove all existing actors , but mainly independent retail dealers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million in sales per year and met@@ amor@@ tization $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business , and in the quantities at Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s high fixed cost basis , could cost around 13 million $ of earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told at a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly comment on Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ o &apos;s food and food trade , which provides approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction in the same time pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , is resist@@ ing and investing more than $ 150 million in order to equ@@ alize selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores by rapidly growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading rehabilitation programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ burg and , according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ i with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee twice , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Cy@@ rene , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp@@ ing sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am quite en@@ vious about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he &apos;s not the first player who broke a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I believe he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision not to consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z during the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right thing for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ burg &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick has quickly made Ascension to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he goes up in the eyes of the public and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency stop , closes the border , with@@ ers refugees
Hungary declared the emergency stop and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants accumulate in a No@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the B@@ order ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian pro@@ visi@@ oning police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc would not agree on a common immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a swift action of Brussels or its neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency state that was called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , stated that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS news correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were employed at the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not prisoners of war who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come here by inj@@ uring the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are in a hurry to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carriage had arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos envel@@ oped the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to get there .
about 20 managed to get there , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national pol@@ l
former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced if he is chann@@ eling for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of democratic voters in the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidate they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved a number of profits .
Clinton has a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
your support with the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has become volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , however , has a big advantage with the older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say nationwide that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are above all enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters are saying that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s support has also been mentioned by Clinton &apos;s supporters ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the di@@ vis@@ ability are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice @-@ president raises a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked of the prim@@ aries , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clinton &apos;s followers more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to candidate for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage ahead of S@@ anders will increase from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that he sees as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cho@@ ic@@ est &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important to a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the di@@ vis@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters will be considered unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important tra@@ its of voters in the constitu@@ encies of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
for the three candidates , Bi@@ den best cuts off with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server are still being questioned as Foreign Minister , most Demo@@ crat voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their Clinton &apos;s general opinion although 36 percent said that their opinion has wor@@ sen@@ ed of it .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views of Clinton are worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of eligible voters nation@@ ally see Tr@@ ump rather than hon@@ estly and not trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good leadership notes .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders as being honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump on the national survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
in the meantime , half of the voters &quot; support in the new pol@@ l is eliminated by the two candidates , while others lose a dramatic stance .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot at the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and has sur@@ passed tr@@ ump among repub@@ li@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Govern@@ ors John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son climbs in the poll@@ s - he lands at 19 % support with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the pump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant swimming temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
on the other hand , swimming temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt came to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Bar@@ uch College no@@ vices
nearly two years after a student died during a horri@@ fic ritual of a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people were lod@@ ged .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , told the police .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound ster@@ ling back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
after all , Mr. Den@@ g compla@@ ined of head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital like the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gling his symptoms and cont@@ acting Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to bring advice , said Poli@@ sig@@ nor Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide their utensils and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ sig@@ nor Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with d@@ ull force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died on the ch@@ ic@@ ane since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended a charge of murder of the third count for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ment attacks and the formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed raises the interest rate
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest rise is coming , and domestic demand is falling , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers very little guidance for the process .
a recession reached the first rate of interest within just 11 months and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore representatives of the US Central Bank stressed so heavily that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find out that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of interest rate rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase hits , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that net income increases 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , in the past 35 years , the market is usually in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the road to interest rise , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal conditions after 500 days , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Head of Investment Strate@@ gies at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not have existed before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , there was only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 per cent of the 118 interest increases since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the year , market participants agreed to increase the F@@ ed rate , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading gives only a 25 percent chance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the increase @-@ in cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights very quickly after the start of recovery &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest waiting the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months to date .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticipated interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in stocks when they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first raise / lowering takes place in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle the bond yields dropped immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer tightening of margins between longer and shorter loans and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest loans often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting to say that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aside from the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted itself to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded , and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in large and large , companies operating the larger part of their business operations in the United States will benefit from rising interest rates and making local products more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be po@@ orer , as a rising dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded average by 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt becomes a major problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from rising dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
savers can see profits through higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leader board member and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private channels do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguished from his commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC Director @-@ General rec@@ alled the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport under fire to put the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he would like the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the next time a series of entertainment star@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased slow@@ ing in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest result since the recording began in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed issues in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
overall expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there is evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of IM@@ R@@ G sales re@@ xes to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to buy their purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will retain their purchases from this event held on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from doing purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spent a little over £ 1 online .
some products , such as TVs and washing machines , are now carried out more than a third of purchases via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part to the gigantic Saudi bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those killed when a crane collap@@ sed in the Mek@@ ka city .
mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the route to pay homage to their respect when the first of the dead approached Al @-@ Mo@@ dena cemetery .
the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place where only days before a building crane broke through the mos@@ que &apos;s ceiling and then fell onto the bed@@ side .
the corp@@ ses were approved for the funeral , when the Saudi king granted a san@@ ction over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 .
the corp@@ ses of 29 beds who were killed when a crane rush@@ ed through the Great Central mo@@ cha of Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead were Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane under@@ lined .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ lers will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group should not have stopped the crane arm when he was not in use .
an Arab version of the decree that was published by the State Saudi Press Agency said the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was forbidden abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised what caused the fall of the crane , which rush@@ ed to a courtyard of the Grand Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ ling , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not release any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ ad@@ ed the group due to not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Grand Mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Ben Laden family has been associated with the sovereign family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the de@@ ceased Chief of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the fall of the crane came amid heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay hospit@@ alized .
government officials ruled that 1 million rif@@ les ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
other verb@@ s get half of this amount .

the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to perform DIY jobs in their homes , such as the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Bau@@ markt @-@ chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled crafts@@ man from Eastern Europe has now sur@@ passed the services at low prices .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at professionals and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions are made by women .
at the moment the men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to address the growing demographic trends that have more female single households than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this stronger to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year earnings and sales after the Group ow@@ es the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball court master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation on Wednesday .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of authority .
he was acqu@@ itted of this alleg@@ ation in May .
the current trial has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed out that in 2006 @-@ 2011 the defend@@ ants used funds from the association accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
it costs around 400@@ ,000 euros .
sports officials are also accused of financial passing .
this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the dis@@ miss@@ al of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen in the association .
the sports officials only compensated for compensation and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money , amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry the club further or lock it up ? , &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the B@@ read @-@ based audi@@ tor of the financial office .
with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to pay any debts .
on the other hand , in case of financial success , the payment of the expense allowance retro@@ active until 1991 was decided .
therefore one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , even l@@ ump @-@ sum and not detailed accounts seemed to appear , the ex @-@ man explained the processes .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ us shared the two defend@@ ants in common , said the second defend@@ ant .
the judge asked why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial statements , it is important only the freedom of debt , the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against which a function@@ ary investigation began due to abuse of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the accused declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; the judge wanted to know .
the respon@@ dent had no answer to this question for a long time .
then he finally thought that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known something of that money , the prosec@@ utor placed him in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repar@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damage compensation ? , judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant pointed out that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the cutter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never obtained a cent salary , he merely added o@@ dom@@ es and di@@ ets .
he added 1,000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual expenses had been much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not prove the defend@@ ants .
they were no longer kept , according to an audit in which everything was judged correctly .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
he explained in his statement that he had to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the Bank , he stated in his statement .
the main hearing continues on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard opens another 30,000 jobs
in addition to personnel cuts running for three years , the company will be able to reduce additional jobs when the company is split .
the stops at the US computer terri@@ fic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) don &apos;t come to an end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers .
as a result , costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion that will fall in the fourth quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share was 2.3 percent .
the company from Pal@@ o Alto , California , has grown up with printers . this is how the computer and printer business is still to be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data store for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services enabled the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to drive to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a spl@@ itting up and massive set @-@ up of changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded very late to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do business more and more online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
the direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would predominantly be rep@@ u@@ di@@ ated : 54 per cent said , however , 35 percent cons@@ ented .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria find 61 percent positive .
24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
in collaboration with Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed say that 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second day of arrival at the 6@@ 6th IAA
the main focus of the fair is on September 27 networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electric mobility .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility combines &quot; on Thursday .
the wide public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
like two years ago , the organisers of the Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA account for about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and floo@@ d@@ lights against several hundred abandoned refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k experienced the violent erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen a water@@ shed was ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the public officials .
the officials initially set pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
the police then used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees gathered in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of Dec@@ ision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half that the F@@ ed would do so now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , senior staff member at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ ary outlook on global circumstances .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 PM CE@@ T on Thursday
death Glo@@ be at Delta State University leaves ap@@ ologies for debt relief
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleague later on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said he had shot on someone and killed some one .
lamb told the employee of the emergency department that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be upset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in@@ quired of the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give it .
lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb took 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ a had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and P@@ enti@@ sh had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen brought him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 .
stars who lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some st@@ res@@ sive years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor is also alleged to have to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1000 executives will cost the Group &apos;s workforce the work@@ space .
meanwhile , with the pilot union , there are new negotiations .
Lufthansa establishes its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the stream@@ lined Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was a profit contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no executive board in the future for the passenger business in the future .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings , managing director Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
so far the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operated under the airline roof of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the Pilot Study Cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike started .
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks shall be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , cockpit aims to come as quickly as possible into viable results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilot , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept is in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa has out@@ sour@@ ced routes to the Group &apos;s own cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this made the left outside def@@ enders to cry and exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being transported to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then the six months will last , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the im@@ position of a mil@@ lim@@ eter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos; account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am coming back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the PS@@ V defeat
with the European Championship in France , England &apos;s defender has added an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad violation , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel so badly . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you &apos;re probably David Cameron .
when he was asked by a child care system provider to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message we have missed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the story of the book , instead returns a summary of the movie version of 2012 that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ in @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot; a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it were not yet suspect enough : the text submitted by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ned @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here , an unknown boy hears , like the local environment by the gre@@ edy , trees for@@ ging , thin @-@ bloo@@ ded once @-@ ler , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral community .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ oon &apos;s employees , but no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a forward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown great@@ ness at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to skip Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I have said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have prolonged the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
if he hopefully turns further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss commen@@ ded his attitude even though he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation you can raise was that England first put Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as ly@@ re was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer that I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw early in Yor@@ k@@ shire when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as the one before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to make mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin bow@@ ler and receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared and I didn &apos;t mind anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious player of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he managed three hundred re@@ ws immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari arrives in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him , he has impressed me very much as a young man .
people may look at his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no great number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made some wise additions to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ e , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cub@@ icle , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team@@ mates at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not deployed at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some won &apos;t agree , but coaches and team players don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at fre@@ und said recently that some member states are deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU is , and not always on their own debt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contract changes that they mostly do not want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not even je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and shows that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come in some capitals to the point where they care whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exagger@@ ated res@@ ins like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a lef@@ tist one .
it is difficult to imagine that they are getting a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something that they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
that &apos;s why some such ministers might not even plan some helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press , as they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our 1973 entry with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they may remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who made himself a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Stra@@ i@@ ght Ban@@ ana &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed knew Mili@@ band who was his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ gers , tel@@ eph@@ ones and pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals , most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had opposed the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , who thus opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he needed no more time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch Strategy of the 1980s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I press it in a friendly way - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ ish @-@ off tendency and the wild gra@@ dient of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can say yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary said , &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week , when the sc@@ outs were struggling in him not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be un@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and MPs after all reports on their convention on Monday evening .
whatever the bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to medi@@ ate - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the era of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right not to give Cameron any free ticket for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks this way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities of EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the petty difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - in order to make concessions to the British when all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start on Monday of something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise public health report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) study Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive verification of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an edi@@ tori@@ ally in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month picked up the &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to guide their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received funding from British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed testim@@ oni@@ als from BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding , which he should have received according to reports from tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco line of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; den@@ otes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that the BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to the tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
due to the clear presentation of recent evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former Chief of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for having publicly @-@ j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in highly controversial newspaper windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and tran@@ smit@@ ters like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on commission or send , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson as part of his investigation on BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad a support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is financed , which could be financed even without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC &apos;s fault in hunting for reviews is &quot; because of the ambition of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows are what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ on should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue , if they go on their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window , where no one ever wanted to see them .
to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from it .
of course , we all think that one gets a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for £ 150 , I wonder if this is true because they do not consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , train , and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should take a look at the public television stations in Australia and Canada , for example , &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and entertaining . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like the one of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and deal with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alli@@ ances in order to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called son@@ o@@ genetic which can be used by ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure could some@@ day replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms do not normally react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired position in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

&quot; important notice : travel from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) can be read in the characters of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into the image of a tank .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic , shad@@ y company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger by introducing bright colors and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago I became a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and at the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student resi@@ dences varies from easy to nerve to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you can come from , where and where you took Sab@@ b@@ year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn &apos;t talk to , even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people do it .
people often turn into beverage recipes , movie night venues and municipal gathering points , but they are also places where people dress up and wear their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship with a university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him a text message instead of kno@@ cking on it .
speaking of apro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship through baking .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when they kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk @-@ owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a fl@@ ush@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the right to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it was something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 pm , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left their own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you are holding a room@@ mate for her future wife , going to her , separating herself and seeing her every day and perhaps seeing how she moves together all friends together ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future wife , try at least to give your abdom@@ en a bit of reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but don &apos;t t@@ ack your possessions at the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ ler builds terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build good and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year @-@ old in the interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ ler believes to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ ler , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ bert : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability .
because people remain here for a great deal .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ ler : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when you put people in blocks .
each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
the houses can then be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ ler : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ ler : in building law , I have correctly dra@@ gged my project .
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ ordin@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ min@@ ed who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ bert : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .

but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ bert : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; true , we had a building boom in Germany over the past five years , but luxury apartments have been built , which can hardly afford more . &quot; &quot; &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message saying that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update is F@@ ailed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made that impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the update . similarly , it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is finished .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone might switch on half way and this could lead to a crash of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded three months ago and has added another member in its ranks , so the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which Alfred Klein accepted .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district office is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined the social foundation &apos;s man@@ tle and opened a new focal point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation runs it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seekers receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or health care insurance benefits .
for years we have been using our out@@ patient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many services of insurance companies are not seldom used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , which is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers of the retirement centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis are perfectly complementary .
Sal@@ u@@ di stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre will see both business leaders especially in the demographic transition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also devoted itself to the lon@@ el@@ iness of old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gathering . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and as good as possible in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Vienna architect Karl Mu@@ ang died for 92 years
Karl Mu@@ ang , one of the Do@@ yen of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus was sharing on Tuesday .

according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
intellectu@@ ally , he did not admit it .

Wiese stor@@ med out of the shop , insul@@ ted the cler@@ k and threw it in front of the feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper reported .
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says of the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beat 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 11.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way to Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed according to the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the level of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young boy and hit the face with the fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al leg@@ ging and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car right up to the apartment and took demonstr@@ atively over there several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male member .
with the help of a stroke @-@ stock , one applied to the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be transported to a hospital for medical care .
to date , only a vag@@ ue day description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 m tall and was dressed with a pair of jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police will ask witnesses and credi@@ tors to sign in at + 49 ( 0 ) 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller performs field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
also the mayor , Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs may@@ ors Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her successor , Karl @-@ Heinrich , will be on hand for his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the office on 12 October , until then he will invest 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was symp@@ a@@ thetic at first glance when the Fel@@ den@@ iz@@ ens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing her specialist training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ lers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mu@@ eller &apos;s husband liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the mil@@ lers bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family @-@ father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz &apos;s district and volunte@@ ered to participate in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from the 19th of September the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ce@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ alist ) has specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ lers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler receives a total of 50,000 euros in funding from the district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized joint mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come into the field of field breaks every quarter , in the north German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another GP practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
if no successor had found himself , she would have gone too .
anyone who visits Müller &apos;s consultation hours also looks at familiar faces especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their par@@ ting , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen sm@@ iles .
a little sad@@ ness she already felt after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Intern@@ alist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also driven up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the supply and safety of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , even not through the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia is den@@ ying
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also leave arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
that &apos;s how the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is , on the other hand , already severely checked as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the minister pointed out , Sloven@@ in wants to prevent its borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the near corn fields .
according to local media , since then , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continues to meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country will be reck@@ oned with about 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , there would be buses from Pres@@ evo at the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was the case that people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , and in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were on the way through Serbia all night long from the approximately 500 kilometers distant Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary did , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of the Interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , had previously stressed that in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees , his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations .
he did not refer to details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; extensive opportunities for border control . &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently confirmed the country as regards the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely blocked .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees intend to travel to the Croatian border .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic , tried to soo@@ the Wednesday morning with a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he keeps the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
it would not currently be a very high number of refugees .
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian territory still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

the proceedings against 32 further accused began .
most of the accused were from Ukraine and Georgia .

ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
the people do their err@@ ands , partly fast pac@@ ed steps , sometimes lei@@ surely stroll .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ on at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
hold the c@@ ms of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , lively life with wonderful autumn sun and in the middle of it four big tables each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die ... &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this action , E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Aid ( E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Aid ) drew attention to its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we have been in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Aid is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by for questions and discussions as well as volunteers .
while some people spontaneously access the chal@@ k and read the phrase about &quot; my life affir@@ ming , &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffering , &quot; others stay short , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
over and over again there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carriers of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 year old .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tablets is understandable , but it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has made a great contribution to the opening of the people .
an assessment shared by An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the star and mourning accompan@@ ist is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was seeking honorary official , she immediately reported and had been there at the foundation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can work well with her job and his experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ atory ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of the death and mourning group .
every two years , training for new employees will be offered .
the tables described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
other personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards .

analysts expected a pol@@ l of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view will take effect despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will take effect on January 4th , and despite higher sur@@ charges for body@@ work of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said that the result was expected to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achieves solid yields by considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday jobs were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve of the analysts surv@@ eyed by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the analysts asked analysts expected a $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express shipment to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping boo@@ sted the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter , sales in body@@ work increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit reported higher revenue due to higher prices , while earnings dropped due to higher labor costs in cargo business .
in pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most awa@@ ited conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spend two days sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the ly@@ re for the first time for almost a decade .
there is a mur@@ al of the United States about them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story session hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation ahead of all other things .
the Central Bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US occupation and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data on the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are seeing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es itself against the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted a rate increase this week .
however , the financial markets expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts reduce the strike by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value was 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she must go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would soo@@ the the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even more than a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would require more economic progress , an increase in the sentence .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level seen by the F@@ ed as full employment .
wage increases showed signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world picked up at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , with which the Dow is now around 10 % below the May of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation as to when to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred within the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins in this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to better get the grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere indication of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
in 1998 / 1999 , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , decided to apply for an increase in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a limited recognis@@ able impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives cleared these cuts .
the F@@ ed should consider aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market launch , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England Inter@@ est Deposit .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il do not come near this plane , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , president of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Leben@@ shilfe für Flüchtlinge
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not possible without the involvement of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 list@@ ings .
every Thursday it is done at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite another class than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric cardi@@ ologist SP@@ RS seeks to enligh@@ ten women on how important good nutrition during lac@@ tation is . it does this by presenting images of babies that su@@ ck up breasts which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research indicates that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification required by mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried authorized the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ as@@ tics building at the Bern@@ ried Sport@@ complex is moving forward step by step : in the recent municipal council session , the excav@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
previously , among other things , the committee had approved an application for a statutory exemp@@ tion of &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid building plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built with not @-@ to @-@ the @-@ kind first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof @-@ tilt , which for energetic reasons - different from the construction plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof@@ ing permits no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; community council &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally relies more restric@@ tively in liber@@ ating applications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project for turn@@ around construction : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
grants are expected from school and mass sports promotion .
in the next proced@@ ural step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will now be presented to the Office of the District Office for the inspection .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed Land@@ rä@@ tin Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Klinik since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who to succeed him , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the In@@ ner Station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , with his team , when the Supervisory Board agrees to appro@@ v@@ ate both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ en@@ schaft , which still has more than 35 beds , should finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district has planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
in the future , Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , proposed rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I exclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the quasi @-@ reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there has not been a real perspective for the house where fisher@@ man has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Li@@ ons is called tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for the arrogan@@ ce .
in the past season , the bad@@ ener used a painful defeat at Bh@@ c and got something good there .
hunting with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their harvesting of corn on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in action , as the police informed .
after a shot , a 63 and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospitals .
it was unclear how exactly it could happen to the accident .
the criminal police were determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds , missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the corp@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police rush@@ ed on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old was also suspected of acting on Tuesday evening who , in fact , admitted the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the corp@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman the investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim .
in the case of inter@@ rog@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing people there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee admitted to the police department to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the dead bodies in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a charge on him .
the further investigations are intended to provide information on the circumstances of the action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
with this , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many then come across the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany is shooting a deficit in the housing shortage , which gets bigger from year to year .
at present , some 77@@ ,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities not@@ ori@@ ously in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the flu@@ ff in the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has decreased in recent years for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve the social housing construction .
thus , the real estate tax is wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats is subject to a limited amount of time .
in addition , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation facilities are necessary according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for the refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W State Bank is already well @-@ known in the case of cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , at 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the available around 300 million euros was rec@@ alled at the Monday evening .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia follow the corridor
there is practically no access to Hungary anymore , since more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia .
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous anyway .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia by establishing a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the de@@ position of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L reports .
Hungary closed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day also make decent asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can travel through , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at Serbia &apos;s border to the neighbouring country of Croatia in the morning .
according to media reports , most of the media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across border f@@ ences .
for this the border strip boasts other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , after the closure of the border , no more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before Tor@@ sten on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws steps the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the south@@ western border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed 35 p@@ uni@@ tive proceedings were therefore initiated .
the convic@@ ted sentenced sentences of imprisonment up to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up on the border , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicant is 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
practically nobody has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungary , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to ti@@ dy up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
barrier screens were disman@@ tled and one of the host@@ els in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this conversion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government information .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influ@@ x of refugees , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drove the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we used the unexpected guests only once , with snack and drink .
we have said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers moved to a regional train in W@@ els from ICE to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening , in order to try again after the announcement that the rail traffic to Germany was stopped , but still to try beyond the border .
the regional train was turned off at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn before the border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday was soci@@ able , day before a two @-@ leg course spor@@ ti@@ ly - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends another thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in establishing structures that guarantee humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has officially and publicly supported the attitude of the Hungarian government into the sphere of national socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees too will have to find out that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomes , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to establish decent conditions for asylum seekers in the face of ongoing refugee streams and approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof lod@@ gings
with the spreading of refugees , Konrad has fully to do all his hands .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to provide quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first opening centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the housing of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 districts for the rest of the year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the govern@@ ors of the country .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator will also expect great expectations in the ORF @-@ Aktion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it is not possible that the trans@@ duc@@ ers have to comply with a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the so@@ iling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited period of time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , in contrast to the Interior Ministry , Konrad establishes with his experience .
I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asive power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier are not responsible for the Republic , as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own district search has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the suffer@@ ers can now be accommodated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the head of the city is critici@@ zing the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday , has cor@@ ded further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now also the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees in Germany .
however , the investig@@ ators would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue by the other EU member states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical sequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deri@@ ves from the actions of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general renovation of the &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ bedarf is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology field .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Swoboda .
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later on acquiring which ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building has been leasing to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center from Linz AG for 60 years .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ gre@@ er opened second shop in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to delay the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop opposite the shop , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories costs up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been re@@ mod@@ elled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor in the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna are also impressed by the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who herself have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has brought Br@@ eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional woman cannot answer with the last safety .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag of every outfit is upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ emaker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also links some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for you .
whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalists touching or revealing knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office whi@@ r@@ ls up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate c@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire came from .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ yer hair@@ style is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is related to it above -@@ zig @-@ k@@ itt@@ ens .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; Sim@@ one Wen@@ del says .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tr@@ ump , also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word - so with the statement that he would be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the heart .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is a bit of a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the investors , they say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ ump therefore comes from the village of the investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant in the USA for gold dig@@ gers .
the foundation stone of the property group was first real estate in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he had been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , announced the start of the movie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken of Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was born Tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans dist@@ anced himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always about thousand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension sp@@ ill Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz rounded off something for the church organ during a visit , which sounded generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine it from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t want the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the Sa@@ w at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the United States arous@@ ed interest .
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ village . &quot;
from the hands of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for Sustainable Tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in today &apos;s show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report on the loss of the leaders of the liber@@ als , but there has been no large shifts at the Today &apos;s Reviews .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the stand@@ still didn &apos;t seem to play a role for Australian TV spectators , as Sunrise aver@@ aged 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities compared with Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months .
in August Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the gap between 40,000 and 50,000 passed .
up to now , sunrise on average 34@@ ,000 spectators at Today stands at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern this morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics wondered if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without Raf@@ ael &apos;s star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was over 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 pm .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute which failed to over@@ lap the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ anne &apos;s Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor &apos;s .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally ends up in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ anne &apos;s Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood has sealed his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers could become a game per@@ ish@@ man who won the heart of Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah ) and S@@ ams energies noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah stands at both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked of whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 7 : 30 PM on Wednesday .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game when he lost a fight like the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions on Tuesday at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also to the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the changing cub@@ icle after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Fr . Tom@@ sul@@ a publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne during his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his hidden catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian battle had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a po@@ orer start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

due to the high numbers of refugees , the Free voters call for the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ bol@@ ger warned of a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Cour@@ age when there are no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to prevent the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ bol@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get dis@@ gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of Free voters ad@@ jour@@ ned until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commune .
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the free voters meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lap the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ bol@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ bol@@ ger also called for more personnel for the administrative tri@@ bun@@ als , which are responsible for asylum applications : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ makers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ bol@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards in federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria sli@@ ps off , others are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a long lasting burner remains on the agenda : the education policy .

stronger Wall Street helps Da@@ x jump on le@@ aps
the German stock market has closed its earnings after a long @-@ distance and nervous trading course .
only in the afternoon was a fir@@ mer pr@@ el@@ ude to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately boo@@ sted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward .
M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

in the US , the Dow Jones Index noted around 1 percent of the increase in sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect the markets to be replaced until after the interest decision in the US and also for the great decline on the terminals on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the discussion about the loads from the nuclear phase has temporarily pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and also left deep marks at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the German energy companies might be missing 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government denied the figures quoted in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the Da@@ x summit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , investors gave too little attention to the German chip manufacturer .
investments in future @-@ oriented wafer technologies and focus on the car market should be paid .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were set off than in the same period last year , as the AC@@ EA trade association announced at the launch of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the manufacturers of Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before taking back on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately obvious why the rubber bul@@ lets used , which are known to kill them , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , evi@@ dently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern states , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ r@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu on certain cl@@ auses , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den youth centre Alte Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mix of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den City wants to market an area of around 4,000 square meters directly to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
the plan is to use the premises for a mixture of trade , trade and housing .
wait for appropriate offers , it is called by the city .
the investor in@@ quired is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded accordingly .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property that is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , bought already a few months ago and the building can be demol@@ ished .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for the holiday settlement on the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor creates plans for the project for the first time .
many of the An@@ li@@ eger are ag@@ itated - they fear the sale of their leisure center
for months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , ag@@ itated , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the Little Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the interest , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ de Company &quot; System @-@ Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused the investors and the management of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months now .
the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building were ev@@ oked by strong reactions among hor@@ ser@@ people who had come to the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea books and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant leap overlooking all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics that the traffic will increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus dischar@@ ges in order for that to be reck@@ oned &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well @-@ one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is , however , still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ aig@@ n to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc . ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ of @-@ the @-@ money campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees over@@ roll the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus cru@@ ises , as well hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations providing help for refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally raised funds raised to $ 5.5 million to $ 5.5 million to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after the loss of loss surgery live longer than those receiving non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan , Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital , used data collected in a study since 2007 , comparing two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c breast cancer - leading to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly the same to 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabe@@ tic disease was completely dissolved and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , the diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , according to Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas @-@ rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and rather recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , in obes@@ e people , it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long before we bring people to take it seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have bound their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a subject that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ loved and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly at school times , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so even in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could place a literary monument in her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama , adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader demanded to stop the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , which de@@ votes himself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be confronted with the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama engaged in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of thousands of refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you must think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we have to think about how killing is reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and it caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase in sei@@ s@@ mic dis@@ infection by children over the last 4 years
poison control centers in the US report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection agents such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand dis@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age have reported the toxic@@ ity control centers , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them ends in the emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some kids should drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers dis@@ infection products drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
hand dis@@ infection agents contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few sp@@ lashes of alcohol intoxic@@ ation can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning , especially for small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison control centre at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky going around , but people make this hand dis@@ infection products within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry filling disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered intoxic@@ ated by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ inn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah kept her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trauma , as the girl fell victim to alcohol and had kno@@ cked her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the state of New York were planning to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ infection agents and ex@@ iles them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the en@@ ei@@ ving plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

lack of title competition in Scottish football gets bored - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers Middle Camp@@ player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights from Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , Dei@@ la sw@@ ans .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic fighting must fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and subsequent ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now has five points ahead clearly stands at the top of the table .
Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had already bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel it just like that - but we must go on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we really need Celtic support because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stays with what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was re@@ buff@@ ed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts players Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident happened in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn , Edinburgh , in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the stor@@ mer and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is certain to say that I will not return to Ty@@ n@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glas@@ gow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christ@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s management team still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but admit that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has trust in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to tro@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es happy to &quot; win &quot; against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately needed to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ policies to win a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them five points ahead of Celtic on the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won all , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of that kind won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the numbers of the National Statistics Office ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unk@@ ards interfer@@ ed with the process
as security personnel were unable to bring peace , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody .
a breath @-@ alcohol test yiel@@ ded a mil@@ le of 0.@@ 89 per 16 @-@ year @-@ old .

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Death Valley in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the in@@ mates as he wants and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can contact for this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he talked to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt of a man from Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few metres from a police officer who tried to &quot; sof@@ tly persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called to a house peace incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tone test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like over@@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy .
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had allowed the bomb to rise in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today .
should this lead me to believe that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
is I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and drive me away , and I have no doubt that what I say can now think about it now .
but I am now at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the coach &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have developed with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt check at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching explained that he said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my collabor@@ ators mistakenly placed mud on my leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been like that yesterday all day , which was also the case .
but it was the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after driver flight
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and a driver flight in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured rider .
on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver flight and failing assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy hits against ri@@ vals for claims about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy called criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fight &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised remark about the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ ering of his team and said they were concentrating only on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criti@@ ques of two leading trainers in his team are confident that they worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques all year long . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it is funny as this always appears at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne talks about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 , St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a dirty trick .
but now he has a team that can play and watch it exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like them .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further trials in our game , but is it an exciting game ?
or are there breaks and no points a bit of tension ?
for me , it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bians with 200,000 $ b@@ ail after drug delivery
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to get possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota ech@@ oes .
despite a potentially life imprisonment for attempting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the flight risk at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the asser@@ tive declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he gives his Australian and his Serbian pass , announces himself to the police daily and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab torn apart
at a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver re@@ marked it too late and tried in vain to do@@ dge to the left at the last moment , as the police over@@ took .
the driver &apos;s cab is completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 pm .
there was a loss amoun@@ ting to € 12@@ 2,000 .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child mol@@ estation .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when he was asleep , logged in to an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he then claimed that he did it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction , that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it happened , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent the pictures to him and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the Indi@@ ct@@ ment of having in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , having viol@@ ated the regulations on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gregor S@@ im beg@@ ged that Ho@@ gg did not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , because it could be argued that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the judgement until October , in order to obtain background reports on social work .
in this case , Ho@@ gg was given a deposit but was held in custody on account of hear@@ ings in other cases pending .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the judgment date .
tractors ev@@ ade small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken away from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers made people increasingly close to smaller border cross@@ ings because of fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn river Inn in the Land@@ kreise Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and bushes .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
according to Federal Police reports , more refugees met on Wednesday at Munich Main Station in comparison with the beginning of the week .
approximately 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 am , said a spokesperson in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of checks on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : runner @-@ up of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; awaits in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area across Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , divided by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong low is the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been crossed over the Atlantic in recent days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , it is still to be expected in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ se@@ eh@@ reis , with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , the compact car &apos;s compact car , which is currently particularly well @-@ selling , is to be seen .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment , according to the Federal Railway Authority ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be show@@ c@@ ased at deal@@ er@@ ships in the fall .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel makes a step @-@ ahead of the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only available as a fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the International Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra mate Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ lined sporty GT @-@ version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan off@@ shoot wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti thus fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the range also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ds 4 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which is to be seen at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put their hand at the front end : the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , especially the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition , there are a number of over@@ hau@@ ls and new variants at the IAA in the compact class , such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
the Federal Constitutional Court issued a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel prison , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , is now on his own free foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant for the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges lifted up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of arrest for the compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear of the personality of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
it was only in April that they talked to a prisoner for compensation because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to a 2011 decision , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy of human dignity .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Court of Constitutional Justice , which had agreed to an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff at that time was placed between 15 and 21 hours a day , between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always imprisoned for 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to fights it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not man@@ ned due to lack of offspring , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create the &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is to be found in Germany ?
according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , around 800 000 asylum seekers are expected to come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated commitment in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is going on in Germany gives the following overview .
according to various progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as is currently being built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments drop out of the rental price , and these particularly advantageous apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social apartments each year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion euros a year .
scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there should also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises the project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial that they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
labour is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the society of admission , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ er@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ u@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognition of labour .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers between up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 as well as the residence requirement that asylum seekers are confined to a residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - the view mostly has prevailed that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly .
a large barrier to access the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
until now there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the creation of networks is the king &apos;s path to work integration , according to the opinion of Thr@@ er@@ hardt .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the day@@ care centres , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the parent @-@ rooted parents , it is first of all important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ is@@ bar , speaker for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the demand for educ@@ ators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more technical schools .
in the countries students are prepared for classes with no knowledge of German .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees intend to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohi@@ bits asylum seekers or tolerated their studies - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
prepar@@ atory refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a reimbur@@ sement of residence or debt will not receive any benefits after the asylum seekers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum seekers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; law if they begin studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter do not generally receive a b@@ af@@ e , as they do not fall under the circle of the persons entitled to vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees have had to live for four years in Germany to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten this gap to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this lack of financing must also be closed , for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually grant the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic organization of welfare that takes care of newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
rights include duties as well .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to off@@ end those conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will also have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism becomes more urgent .
although Germany has , as a result of European decisions , has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been calling for and what international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention of Germany undertake must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens want to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously anticipated refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we are creating that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money has to be incorporated into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all the newcom@@ ers to do the same with the registration of health cards .
services rendered could be deduc@@ ted later with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to cut as many people with the limited range of services that the asylum application law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors will above all make language barriers .
even so far , Berlin &apos;s health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are becoming ill @-@ informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in hospitals , but also in medical practices , interpretation costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
it would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee families , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV education .
with the partly other diseases , German doctors come from their education but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ tism or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the doctor is concerned , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed educational system , several refugees even doctors .
in order to be able to practise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therapist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study conducted by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations , and fears of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong shock and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received a psycho@@ therapy so far .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can make an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social services , cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to captiv@@ ate every age group with fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the tile .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the family is thus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily record .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with sense of touch and arti@@ cular feeling .
balancing with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake @-@ people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitudes of cir@@ cus animals are very often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot;
each string unit enjoys around 80 animals from five different continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read off from the eyes upon the possibility of any desire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena .
so the first commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals have lived in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or a hundred spectators , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program ki@@ cks off at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are dis@@ counted .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by the opposition of Members of the Opposition , that they would have received anonymous death threats and were warned of accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
in the last month they had borrow@@ ed him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
spokes@@ man for democratic change movement ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the members of parliament that immunity is ending in parliament , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and its service business activities .
the expected job breakdown leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP added in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and expanded portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard in order to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to tackle the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if its rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old swing during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a larger matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles , or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he played in just 65 of Arsen@@ al &apos;s 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they were in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have the most infrin@@ gement stage .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a certain period of time , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will pass through a career of the kind that he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts its champion league season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey didn &apos;t travel to Croatia , meaning that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a small break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are given by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , while on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 were measured .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has pulled out the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by far away hopes that his management will lead the association to his first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked in arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now has become more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man , with the goal of questioning the culture that men hin@@ der to seek help if they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the battle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the Beau@@ tiful at Friends was that this focusing was turned up@@ side down .
every character was defined not by his work but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football matches in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing for Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even though they often hold back to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telephone counsel@@ ing it explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my audience role for people who feel de@@ pressed and vulnerable to suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am cop@@ ing with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest this weekend with a completely re@@ designed backdrop for the celebration of the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , he will help PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who led the French Master to the way , but afterwards they missed a set of opportunities before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in play against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems and look relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret not having scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris Team , which held a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division on the weekend , but he was stab@@ bed to death in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was called the man to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defence , before he finished Johan Wil@@ and beautifully into the long corner of the grid .
but if somebody believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field lined up a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far away from Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead PS@@ G itself sometimes got up , with some failures and bad degrees , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was p@@ atz@@ ed in the first half alone and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting that was diver@@ ted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Urugu@@ ay@@ an who scored his sixth place of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into play , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could hold the end result low before replacing E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi a goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just ahead of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona a few years ago .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion league winner , twice world champion , twice world champion , once World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was standing before the European Parliament before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won anything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the FC Bayern was also registered .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Uz@@ be@@ k wanted to have me . &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change was not achieved .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record master : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has put Guardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he has got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the whole distance on the grass , turned the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the ultimate class triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays down diversity in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the selected scenario of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the occupation of the film and not in the line @-@ up of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown responded with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian encouraged themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , who is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the film directing rights ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ ets earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after being killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved nationwide impact and urged the legis@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured people .
in February , the singer Prince gave a hint to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter network is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ers who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and user guide Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just ended its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , the player gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and how life changes , he receives the great sati@@ ation .
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any gru@@ dge over it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt just as if they had changed the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ O@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ -- The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
once they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ nic@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then in sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) beat 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Nav@@ al on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the heart well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked much better off in the bull@@ pen , and he put it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh rush , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zer to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run torn down from the righ@@ tw@@ ing Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen delivered the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after Detroit had added an Insurance run at the end of the ninth raid , wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed one , however , st@@ ole S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two cour@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted from the list of injuries prior to the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter first , H@@ ush@@ es left a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 winning stre@@ ak with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tiger laid in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not hit very well , but he has caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic@@ t right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
comments : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries due to a shoulder strain , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is stri@@ pped off the list of injuries to compete against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing since 20 August due to a broken down in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees arrive in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , like the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this event over the past few days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they will then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived in Hessen , according to the government presi@@ ding group responsible for the first recording .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au , too , have furnished emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective displacement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was pleased that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austrian Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , nobody will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees in a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first recording and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , also lam@@ ent it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a pen@@ ultimate perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge power exer@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees have now stuck to the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania was to be closed down with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers ev@@ asive over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of other migrants fell on their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean at the Satur@@ n@@ mond en@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
a global ocean sw@@ aps under the ice cap of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spac@@ ecraft . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the moon is easily stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planets .
this stag@@ gering motion is only small , but still too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the trade journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of Saturn &apos;s moon , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles , thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least on the south pole there had to be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not cleared .
R@@ ama missing several weeks in Munich
around one month the 1860 München was forced to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama offensive player .
the association announced an investigation of an ab@@ duc@@ tor injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the beginning of the week R@@ ama compla@@ ined of pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Munich @-@ based Lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected four weeks of compul@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think about it now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible commitment of a uni@@ form@@ less pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , as a training guest , the six@@ ties first presented a defensive stat@@ es@@ man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
arch@@ ers Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training after his conc@@ ussion next week .
the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent cl@@ ash on his head .
contrary to initial fears , however , he remained without a serious bl@@ ur .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them there are vitamins B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Pri@@ marily , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta carot@@ ene .
the person who eats the fruits thus supports ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to hearty dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as ch@@ ic@@ ory and ra@@ dic@@ cio .

the US parcel service U@@ PS charges up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company already started with the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
drivers are sought after all .
last year , U@@ PS raised its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 aid .
given the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business .
in 2013 delayed deliveries had brought the parcel service to harsh criticism .
first f@@ ren@@ zy storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öhn winds its way through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz was sharing on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night for Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with a storm speed through the fo@@ yer valleys .
after passing on Thursday morning a striking cold front crosses us , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently located on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest exposure .
on the north side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds its way through the valleys in the night .
the fo@@ eh@@ n blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the fo@@ yer valleys until Thursday morning , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow away from the alpine hill@@ side .
here is a rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be calculated in the south of the Alps . this has already fallen into large amounts of rain after the last few days .
on Thursday morning the f@@ öhn winds its way , and in consequence a cold front rolls over Switzerland with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east .
along with the cold front , the wind will fres@@ hen up strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures drop considerably .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sun@@ nier and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome .
in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often only live in secret for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place will become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
at that time he felt the city as a lost sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome .
with his theses , Luther then had initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Old has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Bible , which now has been published with sum@@ p@@ tuous pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 designs articul@@ ated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has been preserved by the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles devoted to themes such as crosses , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ land .
he has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting .
he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current context in today &apos;s context .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation from Martin Luther , each with a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this gives the 75 @-@ year @-@ old double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggered for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was education already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work out so that I may also re@@ mit my father &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art again in the quick@@ est times : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is marked by advertising today , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; come up &quot; into the images , let them look at themselves , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst &apos; : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
I didn &apos;t care to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the mysterious themes which are important for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation .
start of construction for the BM@@ X rail
plans made , space found , companies commissioned to model earth moun@@ ts for a circuit : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished .
failure in politics and administration led to dr@@ uss , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the train .
looking down hill , looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will be submitted in October , the First Co @-@ worker Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate with the Child and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and Bundes@@ liga sets a clear mark on the weekend .
the soccer team responds to the situation in Germany and helps the politicians to cope with the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can tell in principle that nothing beats me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest every single person to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B Chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet State Minister Mr@@ s Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
soccer can and wants to help .
but the decisive course has to face politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal states also support this programme .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear signal if they are on the left jer@@ sey sleeves instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logo ( Her@@ mes ) the impression &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Head of Sports Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama assumes everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can play football fans , no , we have to use our bla@@ sting power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the European Cup against Hungary this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs in their locations had started their own projects was great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B @-@ selection and the federal government , will provide 300@@ ,000 euros each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP chief executive loses an eye in the event of an accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on the steps in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to a water glass after midnight that he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , was impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged out of the road - that he told us last week , &quot; c@@ ites the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I stood all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to rise up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen apart ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen swe@@ ated a similar photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was thrown off the wheel .
he therefore does not come as a reserve driver for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller at the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes of a com@@ eback by Marco Re@@ us in the first group match of the Europa League have definitely sm@@ ashed .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in du@@ el with the fi@@ bre@@ glass Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the BV@@ B coach said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to practice on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ chel is not only able to change its stem cells on the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ way position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the seat of a master @-@ keeper novel natur@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
but if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe league games in the future , Tu@@ chel has left open .
with a high probability , he will also play the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the search statement by fellow player Re@@ us that the final move for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , keeps the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that Marco does not lie so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot;
Ro@@ bot Cars : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing cars .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of transport minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counterpart from the G@@ 7 states , which will also come together with representatives of industry at the International Motor Show .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a high level of switching to digital radio .
in order to test new technology , a test track is currently being developed on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed on the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to work internationally for the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 will be technically feasible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , road@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected to go far ahead of 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly determined .
yet the Germans are still looking skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday is the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not count on it in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed account for up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the Digital Union Bit@@ kom only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
at least 15 per cent of the traffic could be seen on the motorway , 45 percent in traffic jams .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis tournament
according to the current status of the title fight , Düssel@@ dorfer wants to strike only in the single in the title of the title fight between September 25 and October 4 .
the final decision should be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , Head of the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who lists the S@@ etz@@ als in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo had been missing , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ranking List . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a heavy injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : mannequins which look aw@@ k@@ ward human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , but now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from 18th of September , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which a lot of effort was carried out : to fr@@ oth the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have drawn up 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the launch of the Oktober@@ fest a special delic@@ acy was there : a leather pants outfit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Gau@@ l@@ tiers Old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the Desig@@ ners .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught fashion designing fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
it used to go on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to get meters .
the embroi@@ dered cloth and spi@@ kes were produced in a large quantity for customers , which they used for example , for blankets and sheer curtains .
this is no longer possible today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ zz@@ itz P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt c@@ ites some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past styl@@ istic eras , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
he is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery , together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
there are almost no private specialist shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
today , the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
moreover , exports are weak@@ ening , up to date to Russia and the US .
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have been leading a quality seal indicating that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies , which have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly modified to hold a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historic snow@@ ball point .
at the same time , the machine rocks small spheres at some places .
the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ mind Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; before I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says .
they also deliver to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .

you shouldn &apos;t touch legends , but Disney still dar@@ es to watch a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;

it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the global economic crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabit@@ ant milking system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important , as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legally state business environment and is open to the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also ease controls on powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to manage their businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimizing the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ limits in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to give consumers a much higher dose of the tox@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper in the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side @-@ effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force on pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limits of nerve pois@@ oning for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy grounds &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
big pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are , however , already so heavily polluted with mercury , that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 mg of mercury per kil@@ ogram according to F@@ ood@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ cal distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is particularly rich in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish through the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already low quantities can cause damage to the nervous system especially in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily absorbed by the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
