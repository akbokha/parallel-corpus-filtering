the organization is held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of this material in the state or the respective countries concerned and on any passing on of such material from this state or these states .
this explains its agreement as soon as possible ; it extends only to matters such as time and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include endor@@ sement or a knowledge of the military activity , nor does it refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations from this Convention .
if the community , states or persons subject to their authority , however extraordinary costs due to a special request of the organization , the organization reimbur@@ ses these costs , provided that it has agreed beforehand .
in any case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and the States ensure that the protection of liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be avail@@ ed in accordance with their laws and other provisions , to the organization and their officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the nationals of states .
any claim that the community or state against the organization or the organization against the association or the State for damages - with the exception of damages resulting from a nuclear incident - that have ar@@ isen from carrying out the security measures in accordance with this Convention will be governed in accordance with international law .
in accordance with the relevant information submitted by the General Director , the Council as@@ signs that the organization is not able to verify that no core material which must be subject to safegu@@ ards for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explo@@ sives in accordance with this Convention , shall refund the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) and , if necessary , take the other measures envis@@ aged therein .
in such steps , the Council , in which mass has been achieved by the applied safety measures , offers the Community or the State - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - any reasonable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary security .
at the request of the organization , the community or a state , consultations on questions arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the State concerned to take part in the discussion of such questions through the Council .
except for any dispute related to a Council pursuant to Article 19 or a measure taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be settled by an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators , based on the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the community and the States design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appoint a fifth which leads the presi@@ dency .
if the Community and the States or the organization have not appointed two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for an arbit@@ ration claim , the community or organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure shall be applied if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding for the organisation , the community and the countries concerned .
a ) This Agreement shall apply to non @-@ nuclear nations , the contracting party of the Treaty , and members of the Community ( in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organisation noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and
( II ) If the community of the organisation noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the States consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change of this Convention .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conventions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement signi@@ fies agreement and protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the Part I concerning preventive measures .
the aim of the safegu@@ ards set out in this Convention is the timely detection of significant quantities of nuclear activities of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other core explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence of such tur@@ no@@ ff by the risk of early detection .
for the achievement of the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial confin@@ ement and monitoring as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the verification by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity which is not proven for a certain period of time is specified for a certain period of time , stating the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out their audit , the Organization makes full use of the security system of the community after article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for nuclear materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
in applying their security measures , the community will make use of the methods and measures of the following kind , and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are closely identified and expe@@ dient in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system for the determination of the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock removed core material and inventory ;
( B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , examination and evaluation of differences in the measurement of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
e ) procedures to assess the accumulation of un@@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system which indicates the core material inventory and the changes of this stock , including the input and output of the material bil@@ ance zone for each material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) proceedings for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the Organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium containing material which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) is introduced into the states , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material if it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) relies on core material that is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other safegu@@ ards mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions listed in Article 11 are not fulfilled , however , the organisation and community shall consult each other about the use of suitable securing measures for the time being .
B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community shall state that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams - or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material if used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the community , the Organization shall release the core material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures in accordance with the Convention , of these security measures , provided that the total material quantity freed on account of this Article shall not be at any time any more than
a ) A total of one kil@@ ogram of special plu@@ gg@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of the enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if freed core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the security measures in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions are taken for the re @-@ application of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets with the Organization of Supp@@ le@@ mentary agreements necessary to the extent that is required for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organization according to this Convention , in detail how to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements may be extended or am@@ ended without alter@@ ing this Convention in agreement between the organization and the community .
the Supp@@ le@@ mentary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the States undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organization provides a summari@@ zed inventory of all the core materials underlying this Convention , irrespective of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory due to the following reports and the results of their verification .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States of Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other .
GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EW@@ G decided to contribute to the special action programme set up at the International Economic Cooperation Conference to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income whose development is ham@@ pered by common resource transfer problems .
C ) The aim of the EEC and the Member States is that the contribution made by the Member States is bound up within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted one another about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Trade Account &quot; which consists of the funds made by the Member States in accordance with this agreement on the special transaction account ; this account is managed and used by the Organization as Administrator ( in this capacity ) only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment takes place in the form of cash or in@@ interest debt of the member state , which are to be paid on request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the respective country .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the ste@@ ward agreed date ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may , upon request , make payments before the aforementioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes approximately proportional drawing on the cash or the school Notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ approval ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly @-@ ref@@ und@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) regardless of whether it belongs to the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered to be the objective of the agreement , stated in letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the Special Trade Account may not be used instead of the Bank or Organ@@ iz@@ ations of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organisation which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization ; therefore , in ten years , they are ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years .
special transactions are issued in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this fee must be paid directly to the organization that retains them .
any transaction loan is to be indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the means is indicated .
the proceeds from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the recipient country or for goods or services that are produced or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and who may be recipients of a special transaction in accordance with what the administrator has set at the time of loan granted .
capital re@@ payments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be with@@ held back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State in the currency of a member state .
until full disclosure of any transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker will instruc@@ t the EEC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors in preparation and via the projects and programmes approved by the directors .
during the time of the payment of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the EEC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses being made .
as soon as possible , the administrator transm@@ its a detailed account of the transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organisation to this account statement as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC transm@@ its a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are based on the accounts recei@@ vable and the amounts paid from the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the Administrator up to the full issue of the funds of the Special Trade Account from time to time provide an exchange of views of the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date the EEC and the Organisation agreed not to enter into force , the agreement and all obligations of the parties arising there@@ from shall be due with immediate effect .
if the total amount of all the special transaction loans received by the recipients are paid back in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and returned to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC according to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fy the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat shall forward these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper authorization of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the organization .
this agreement is written in two in@@ scrip@@ tions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , and each word is equally binding .
whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter change to change the An@@ nex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - HA@@ T en@@ act the following VER@@ OR@@ D@@ N@@ TION :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Council &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET Project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a common company after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Common J@@ ET &quot; - will be transferred .
Switzerland has been involved in research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is very familiar with the area concerned .
as until the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion is still extensive work to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to avoid their per@@ tin@@ ent efforts in order to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research , which gained a higher priority due to the energy crisis .
this agreement is intended to enable every contracting party to benefit from unnecessary over@@ lap by amal@@ gam@@ ating its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physi@@ ology , thus achieving the common goal of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ effective electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
to achieve the aim of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II , herein@@ after &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom Programme ; it is extended or am@@ ended after inspection by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , which may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this shall be replaced by the programmes listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realized through : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present Convention , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on Eur@@ atom &apos;s programme ;

with the same objective Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland particip@@ ates in the agreement on the promotion of human resource exchange at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot;
in view of J@@ ET &apos;s participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the J@@ ET common company , whose constitution accepts it .
furthermore Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , with the exception of association agreements or other similar contracts signed by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with carrying out the association designated in Article 2 , 1 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the association agreement includes , in particular , the implementation of a steering committee , the competent representatives of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of research and to direct the best possible outcomes in line with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; VG . &quot;
the VG , which has the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions relating to ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom Programme , takes up this task in terms of all research and development activities that this agreement relates .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and aims at fulfilling its T * quality in the interests of the two contracting parties on the common objective established in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss program , as well as to the scientific and technological developments outlined in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives at the consultancy groups established within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme whenever the competent Swiss authorities are seeking .
the consulting groups that provide the VG research proposals with a view that the means approved for the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , take this task as regards all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement .
Switzerland is represented in the committee of directors established within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme by the Director of one of the participating laboratories .

the BI@@ S may conclude stand @-@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks submit a corresponding request .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future EU delivery funds .
even now , however , some conditions are mentioned below for their application the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially take on an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions being extended , but without a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as for their event@@ ual extension the BI@@ Z would calculate a credit opening fee .
in addition , it is agreed that the first drawing will not be made before the end of a month after conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the local currencies at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to a period of time taking into account the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the terms would correspond to those which the BI@@ Z applies at the time on similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely comply with market rates .
if the BI@@ S does not have to proc@@ ure the necessary funds on the market , then the interest rate to be applied could reach a maximum which corresponds to the corresponding margin of Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform me about the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S may conclude stand @-@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks submit a corresponding request . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would tell me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is set at 23 000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ inian h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the communal market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community meets provisions so that the shipments of intervention residues on frozen meat are not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation to the he@@ el of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb .
taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement or other funding measures for ex@@ porting H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as for slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs are only carried out at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and trade agreement .
Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that the quantities specified in this Agreement shall be issued for the products mentioned under number 1 .

the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products made of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned collective bar@@ gaining numbers according to the Community .
the Committee shall discuss any questions arising from the implementation of these agreements and recommends the appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the yearly volume set under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 .
the quantity applicable from the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year is set in relation to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal character of trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and , on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand and on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a deadline of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .

- fresh or cooled pile - , lamb and goat meat ( collective tari@@ ff 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the common customs tari@@ ff ;
- frozen h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( collective tari@@ ff 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the common customs tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the import opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set for the following annual amount :
in order to guarantee a faul@@ t@@ less functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is committed to ensuring that the amount actually executed does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out according to conventional bid forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the form of supply is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community is entitled to safeguard the safeguard clause , it under@@ takes to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the remainder of the year .
the community under@@ takes to limit exhaus@@ tion to the imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ech@@ ing rate of 10 b.@@ H. ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the quantity set under number 2 according to the amount of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import burden of these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall take account of the ho@@ ech@@ est rate of exhaus@@ tion under number 5 .
the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is fixed with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community meets provisions so that the sale of intervention stocks on frozen meat does not under@@ mine the he@@ el of Urugu@@ ay@@ an Schaff@@ hausen due to the implementation of the regulation .
taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement or other funding measures for ex@@ porting H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as for slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs are only carried out at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples which contain an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance specified on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured through repeated th@@ inning of the re@@ agent to be examined twice in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by the volume of the blood cell in@@ undation in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are developed at the time standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter observed in a series of di@@ lution in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the international standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent compared to the international standard preparation or a state standard preparation in international units ( See Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall be retained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form , according to the label , lies at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of the re@@ tain@@ ability tests ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container where they have been dried and that is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ ous @-@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the re@@ agent continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood @-@ group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re@@ opening , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments , gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for international exchange for blood @-@ group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination can be distributed in such a way that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination .
proper samples of all re@@ agents are to be kept from the laboratory until it is prob@@ able that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood type determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective inheritance .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each container , a black on white printed label is available in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ charging ,

in DER weighing that the Community decided within the Action Plan to strengthen the internal market , as of January 1 , 1988 , to introduce a uniform administration paper in Community goods traffic ,
in the calculation that it is appropriate to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by introducing a single administrative document ,
in the D@@ ut@@ ure that this Convention may not be interpreted in a manner that it de@@ bin@@ ds the contracting parties from their obligations under other international agreements ,
in this Convention , measures are set in order to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; this applies in particular to a uniform administration paper ( herein@@ after referred to as Single Resolution Paper ) , which is to be used irrespective of the type and origin of the goods for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as the method of shipment ) .
the form@@ alities associated with the sale of goods between the contracting parties are granted by means of a single @-@ purpose paper , for which im@@ prints are to be used in accordance with the samples in App@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention .

in the cases of paragraph 1 , it may be allowed to use instead of the incorpor@@ ation agent .
if the unity paper is used , the parties involved can join the relevant authorities with the consent of all the relevant authorities , instead of submitting supplements to the stock paper in the trade , in which the goods are described .
- to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of for@@ war@@ ts for their entire goods transport or for sub @-@ areas ;
- in the case of con@@ sign@@ ments containing several types of goods , for the provision of the form@@ alities in the shipping method store lists instead of supplements to be used as a single paper ;
- to allow applications to be created by public or private data processing systems according to the conditions set out by the competent authorities if necessary ;
- to allow the competent authorities to enter the data required for the provision of the relevant form@@ alities in their data processing systems for the treatment of applications , and if necessary , without giving a written registration ;
- to allow the competent authorities in case of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of the applications , that the export , shipping or import registration is due either by the entry paper created by this system or , if such a paper is not created , by entering the data into the data processing plant .
- to make arrangements adopted by the Joint Committee on the basis of a resolution pursuant to Article 11 paragraph 3 .

in the assumption that the development of the technology and structures of international trade makes essential changes of the Brussels Agreement of 15 December 1950 on the tari@@ ff scheme for the import of goods into customs tari@@ ffs necessary ,
