this document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ verage Report ( EP@@ AR ) explaining how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the trials conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need more information about your illness or their treatment , please read the packing supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. If thinking and talking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder where the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alternating with periods of normal atmosphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the injection solution is used to quickly control increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to inhal@@ e or melt the enam@@ el tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
for patients who simultaneously take other medicines that are min@@ ed in the same way as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by means of &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that facilitate the communication of neur@@ ons among themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial Ag@@ ony &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters act to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms was studied in three studies for up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies with 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , suffering from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , more than twelve weeks ago , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a trial of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased rest@@ lessness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the changes in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bed the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to intake .
in both trials with injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ ease compared to patients receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
in addition , for up to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered additionally to an existing treatment .
even more effective than placebo , Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses reduced the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled sugar ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were out@@ weighed against the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in quick monitoring of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in view of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after menop@@ ause , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be applied with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose to hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ er@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia are encountered in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy should be considered to reduce the dose or to cancel treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed .
so Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with care in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ uria , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to deterior@@ ating glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to coma bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central acting medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically in@@ relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; metabol@@ ites the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and the concerns arising in the reproductive studies at the animal , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - A controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , with potential clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects that may arise in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence .
there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is of benefit in the treatment of over@@ dosing , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma retention .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor .
using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dosage in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , on the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ t .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 the respon@@ der &apos;s share of response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was included in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed doses with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy over placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy superior to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior superi@@ ority to the prevention of bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a fall into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ lic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination cycle is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l for extensive metabol@@ ites using C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop @-@ up @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics gave no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with varying h@@ ep@@ atic cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and for the can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the Hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in G@@ all of monkeys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ x of the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can alternatively take the melting tablets to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after onset or after changing of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder over the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was included in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed doses of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy over placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were compared with a dosage of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical c@@ max average value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the Hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ x of the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in order to increase the absorption and minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vention of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if an additional oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with det@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , the patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be applied with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose to hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ er@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occ@@ ured during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ uria , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to deterior@@ ating glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to coma bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater than that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dosage ) was used intra@@ muscular as one @-@ time indication and which simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; metabol@@ ites , compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received intra@@ muscular , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared with the after all@@ some gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant adverse events ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , with potential clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects that may arise in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of a@@ gi@@ tis / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) involving 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as a@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of a@@ toxic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement from initial value on P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score for the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe toxic@@ ity , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the population population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 the respon@@ der &apos;s share of response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression rate were significantly stronger than in Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compla@@ ined about the prevention of bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after the dose of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human@@ izing exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscul@@ arly .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application , no safety @-@ related concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) were beyond the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and for the can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans ; thus , they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent branch @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the Hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in any form or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if one considers only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who previously had other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs in patients with the first treatment and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ene number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment can be interrupted until an improvement is reached in degrees 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were carried out with patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bon@@ ded nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have considerably different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated in the patients until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ine number rose again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly marked cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there is nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patients after the treatment , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment of block@@ age , as the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the traffic jam and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and major incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most eye @-@ catching important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported at 79 % of patients ) and was fast reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 lists the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , elevated blood sugar , elevated phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , painful g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , ul@@ cers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding diseases of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ary receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the tumor area due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ blin@@ ded studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the decay of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft @-@ point connection of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clear@@ ance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ dosage ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the total dose of α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
however , only a few data are available on patients at the age of 75 , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , caution should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , it is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into an Abra@@ x@@ ane flow bottle .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the flow bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid material .
then the flow bottle should be slowly and carefully swi@@ v@@ elled and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until a full suspension of the powder is done .
if precip@@ itation or sin@@ uses are visible , the flow bottle must be inver@@ ted gently in order to achieve a complete reset before applying .
the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated and the corresponding quantity of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PVC or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

member states must ensure that the holder of the authorization for placing on the market prior to the market launch will provide medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( technical information ) , label and packing insert . • A clear picture of the correct application of the product provided cooling boxes for the transport through the patient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that it is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood iron values in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood @-@ blood donation is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with stre@@ amed stre@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a self @-@ blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection may also be performed by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received adequate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced into which it is capable of forming epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the case of an injection , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a primary study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an an@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to stre@@ amed stre@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between 25 and 29 weeks .
the company also presented the results of a study where the effects of stre@@ amed stre@@ amed stre@@ amed under the skin were investigated with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study of patients suffering from an an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to se@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ raine @-@ like head@@ aches and confusion .
it may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
fl@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to make sure that it does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the rules of the European Union the evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces stre@@ amed stre@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce medicinal P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the placing of stre@@ amed products across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned bigger surgical procedures that require large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of external blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in adults without iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml that cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients with hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease ; therefore , the examination of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability of patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed on or under the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in one patient .
in light of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose can be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ emia ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ emia ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ ema symptoms and - following symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor .
in light of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l relative to the initial value , the dosage of 150 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l above the initial value , the dosage should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l relative to the initial value , an indication of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood cann@@ ed is required , should be taken twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight .
as early as possible , the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the se@@ amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine into the circulation .
patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive any stre@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial ven@@ er@@ eal disease , vascular disease of the carot@@ ene or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of time , defined as a reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ contact ( iron , fol@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium oxidation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers should be detected , and if no other cause of a loss of action is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row can be considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of stre@@ amed patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributable to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by concentrating on the concentration necessary to control an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of hypertension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
tumour patients with chemotherapy should consider a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ substanti@@ ated ) for evaluating the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on the benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ ol pro@@ phyla@@ xis as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , particularly in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa can be associated with an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events for patients with an initial stroke value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy returned when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be checked and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dosis should be adapted to the rising hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies of tumor tissues no evidence arises of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , ather@@ os@@ clerosis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ ary events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetic derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ulated and is identical with the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin were consistent with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common malign@@ ancies , significantly higher mortality than in the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and in inspections .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the reviewed data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
according to sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa serum levels are much lower than the serum levels achieved after IV injection .
there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal studies with approximate 20 times the weekly dose recommended in humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fat body weight , to a delay in the os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in fo@@ etal mortality .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a minor trauma of the hip , such as the H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ builds bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study of older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared with the patients .
in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most Ac@@ la@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney complaints , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta manufacturer provides information for physicians who prescri@@ be acet@@ one for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications of how the medicine is to be applied , as well as similar material for patients in whom the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the placing of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the European Union .

for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s disease , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years old ) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on safety and effectiveness are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting the therapy ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid introduction of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure an adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( bad oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with adequate preventive dental treatment .
no data is available to patients who need dental surgery , whether the dis@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of Ac@@ la@@ sta administration may be reduced by the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of suspected atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with kidney dys@@ functions , which manifested itself as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the alteration of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical trial in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of treatment was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the disease @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies .
all patients received supple@@ mental amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the morph@@ ological Pa@@ get @-@ Studien ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a recently received hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study , local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , were reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the oral area was made public , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental surgery .
7 Study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area with an Ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in case of an over@@ dose that leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two light or medium @-@ weight existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly decreased over a period of three years and the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density at the lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ um by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic slu@@ dge were taken one year after the third annual dose .
a micro@@ computer ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture in patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to placebo .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during the duration of the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta therapy increased the BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at the overall stu@@ ds and scar@@ ves at all times .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % over 24 months compared to placebo treatment and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study were random@@ ized to 50@@ 8 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to reduce clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % for Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated males compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the yearly administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at the beta Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was investigated in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly mild to moder@@ ately severe disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
the combined results observed a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron at the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach to 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron could be maintained in an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application .
in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the peak value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination cycle t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of metabol@@ ised substances by cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely because zinc acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 examined patients .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function disorder down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid required .
because for severe kidney dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest un@@ let@@ ally acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight in mice .
in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) were 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with IV application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was administered by using doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated expos@@ ures exceeding the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects on other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and the intraven@@ ous injection point occurred .
the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spontan@@ eity in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals during the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels .
if the drug is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone conversion is too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by normal@@ ising the bone structure again , ensuring normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have used them recently , even if they are not prescription drugs .
it is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , you are concerned that you will have enough fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have broken the hip recently , it is recommended to take the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta is working for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please notice your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and shi@@ vers , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .

sustained pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or the jaw were mainly reported in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information information .
if the drug is not immediately used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need to be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid introduction of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , corresponding to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you need more information about your illness or their treatment , please read the packing supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , A@@ comp@@ lia is used to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
in addition , four studies were conducted on more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive drug for setting the smoking compared to placebo .
on the other hand , the studies on smoking smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this area of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia that were detected during the studies ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable while using A@@ comp@@ lia using medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HIV infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

it supplements diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported with up to 10 % , suicide thanks to up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in the case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment in an individual case predomin@@ ate the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who - apart from obesity - have no apparent risks , de@@ pressed reactions can occur .
relatives or other related persons are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as handling the animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no adverse effects on fertility or cycle disorders were observed .
the impact of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ verage Report ( EP@@ AR ) explaining how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the conducted studies in order to reach recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest acceptable dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , making type 2 diabetes better regulated .
for more than 1,@@ 400 patients , the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced by applying the dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional dosage of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ resin was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was investigated in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who included Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took additional placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor ( e.g. heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
in this study , there was an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , hypertension , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked .
the decision whether treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be conducted by the clinical assessment until the clinical trial has been completed .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can result from fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ dy@@ no or two @-@ compartment combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a reduction in visual acuity was reported under the treatment of thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indic@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or occurs , the treatment should be cancelled ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance in pregnancy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etal growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( cannot be estimated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and refra@@ ction index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic drugs .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ specimens occurred three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as under placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients were conducted in the group treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms appeared .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it has been shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time until the end of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite a three @-@ month optimization phase were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared with the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slight , but clin@@ ically in@@ significant elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in , or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide , reduced the overall plas@@ mat@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels was found under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while levels of met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide were observed .
in a study of 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this both by an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
according to oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ bed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application are reached .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV contributes to the effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in decay ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elimination cycle of unchanged pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and all of the active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clear@@ ances of the mother &apos;s substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies appeared in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the resulting hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal dimin@@ ish , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etal growth .
long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) induced increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tumours ( male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um .
in an animal model of family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide have been studied .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both by an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was lacking its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is not associated with cardiovascular long @-@ term risks .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced similarly to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood sugar ( the complete list may be found in the packaging supplement ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by an intensive insulin therapy , may change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of thickness , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin of animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to acet@@ one in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or other than their previous insulin .
when travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor therefore has to consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ adequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with transi@@ ent or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Ac@@ tu@@ ally - peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid recovery of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 . an intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar setting can , however , be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
skin and sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue illnesses - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection site , li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur if failed to change the insertion points within the injection range .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can , however , develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated through the oral supply of glucose and sugar @-@ containing foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a one @-@ weigh@@ ted help person or through glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire time of operation is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sile ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) loc@@ alities on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans .
it is recommended to increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane flow bottle is removed from the refrigerator before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the instructions for the first use .

this document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ verage Report ( EP@@ AR ) explaining how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the trials conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
the medic@@ in@@ ally effective ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the method of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ med@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu © E@@ MEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged ?
Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
additionally , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin must be raised , followed by the amount of insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment .
when travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the administration site - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma may occur at the injection site ) .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a one @-@ weigh@@ ted help person or through glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
clinical trials in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures showed that a 42 % reduced mortality was reduced by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged 13 to 17 ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ E. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ E. / ml insulin human in the in@@ fusion fluids 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D@@ - glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable for 24 hours at room temperature for 24 hours .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have signs of de@@ br@@ is , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or arthritis ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger agate @-@ crystalline deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
rheum@@ atic attacks can still occur during the first treatment months , and it is therefore recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic treatment for the first six months will still have more medicines to prevent rheum@@ atism .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving a dose of 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 from 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who received 120 mg once a day , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ uria ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
particularly in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also cause a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already lead to urine deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or current g@@ out node and / or g@@ out arthritis ) .
if the serum residual acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into account daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t receivers , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ essed medicines , an acute rheum@@ atic attack can occur during the course of treatment because the reduction of the serum acid level first mobil@@ ises ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine in rare cases is so wide that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing the Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before starting the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ treatment and in the course of the course ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was not performed any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll @-@ level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with an increase in f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .

in a study of subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x measured a moderate 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of a sei@@ zur@@ ite containing magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminium hydro@@ xide , delays the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a reduction of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change of the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies let not close to side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol Group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once were listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no serious rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years .
the related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ ot@@ es@@ thesia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of skin , skin stain@@ ing , skin les@@ sion , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein ur@@ inary , kidney failure , erectile dysfunction , increase of the potassium concentration in the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and is produced within the framework of the reaction sc@@ ade Hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro escap@@ ement , which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
the efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was demonstrated in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
Plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with serum incre@@ in@@ ine value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x per day compared to treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x per day compared to treatment with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction of serum acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ atin values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( i.e. , h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage decline of serum acid concentrations in subjects , despite their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum har@@ n@@ ate concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of serum concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
data from the Phase 3 open extension study collected in two years showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the number of gi@@ mm@@ ers , which resulted in a complete disappearance of the g@@ out no@@ des by month 24 at 54 % of the patients .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ l / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportion@@ ate increased .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration was observed , provided this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range of 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma penetration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites were mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as an unchanged f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as imm@@ utable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at decreased approximately 1.8 times of 7.5 μ of ari@@ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ of ari@@ h / ml in the group with severe kidney @-@ s@@ itter function .
12 Li@@ ver Dys@@ function After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( chil@@ d- pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction changed the C@@ max and AU@@ C from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered un@@ relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
in high doses that were approximately 3 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which was accompanied by lowering the re@@ aring performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in bearing rats with ex@@ positions , approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in supporting rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times of human therapeutic exposure , did not reveal ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble .
if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the formation of crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be used , if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine , if you have a heart failure or suffer or suffer from another heart problem . • If you are suffering from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration following a cancer or the les@@ ch @-@ ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disorder where too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) .
if at the moment you have a rheum@@ atic attack ( sudden occurrence of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , feeling of warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the rheum@@ atic attack is cleared before starting with the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
this does not have to be with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary in order to prevent a rheum@@ atic attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding boo@@ sting vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only received Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the same dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive apparatus such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , abdominal abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as acid b@@ umping .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it must not be used in the case of diseases of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients unable to stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can only be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or dis@@ assemble the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract apart from p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , should be given only under special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cers and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( some were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end the medicine in the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star@@ ial pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ zer@@ a were rarely reported , including some severe and severe complications ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men predominantly administered intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available which indicates whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned at the scheduled weekly day .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines can interfere with the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in clinical trials was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the serum calcium levels were up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ing@@ es@@ tion of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) Vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ mes to vitamin D@@ 3 .
the main effect of 1.@@ 25 D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase of the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as regulating serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al muscul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ia can lead to increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies , the mean arter@@ ies of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.@@ 2 % versus placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved with the share of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ wel@@ s continued to remain ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and thereafter 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the appearance of at least a new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption At an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the average oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ gh@@ tly fast and two hours before recording a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies of rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
after IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the waste .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and systemic clearing exceeded 200 m@@ l. / min .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is affected by these transport systems .
absorption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) after the administration of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after ni@@ gh@@ tly fast and two hours before reception of a meal , the middle area under the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 was 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( without taking into account endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 levels ) .

ex@@ cre@@ tion In the case of a dose of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy subjects , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the decay after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics of patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is nonetheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bone is expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see Section 4.2 ) .

because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already employed in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , compared with the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in whom the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a year of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including either under @-@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or the regime should be performed only under closely mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of impact and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below )
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low should be checked before the switch and over two weeks after the switch .
in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable both in kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low are recommended during the first two weeks following transplantation under lawyers to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ transplan@@ t phase .
because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ level substance , an adjustment of the an@@ agra@@ f dose can take several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral treatment in the first post @-@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application For the suppression of the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , the maximum duration of the oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dosage in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dosage in the morning .
dosage recommendations - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of adv@@ agra@@ f , thus this conversion has to take place in a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must commen@@ ce for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients converted to adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is to be taken daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , p@@ ank@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ted patients , came to an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood circulation in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum levels of serum , a calculation of the cre@@ atine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to adv@@ agra@@ ph when switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of impact and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the help of full @-@ blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low @-@ level controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood flow levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustments , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time applying substances which could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the indications in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the tal@@ low level does not exceed 20 ng / ml in the blood .
in clinical practice , the levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood usually lie in the range between 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t receivers , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or the regime should be performed only under closely mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ated formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ ph are still available for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood .
due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy , known as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and visual disturbances indicate , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. .
since adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose is included , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels with simultaneous use of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose accordingly to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of the gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus lowers the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus can increase hormone exposure , precau@@ tionary measures should be taken cau@@ ti@@ ously in decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially l@@ essen the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long its half @-@ life .
the results of a low number of transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , as is well known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which frequently increases suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal den@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with adv@@ agra@@ f .

due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding on er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it is assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a specific number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in the large trials in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent , multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported about 110 patients receiving either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
a chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ acy syndrome , was seen less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in tac@@ ro@@ lian and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patient @-@ transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed to 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ t , following a random@@ ised trial of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on the 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after bow@@ el transplan@@ tations showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ tied faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , mainly via bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients ( once a day ) in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .

advoc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method referred to as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced into which it is capable of forming the human factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ates in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tic episodes with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies compared to Factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ant may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the Factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and the extent of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following here@@ after @-@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall under the specified plasma seals ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute injury are eliminated .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
during the treatment process , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to Factor VI@@ II , can achieve various in vivo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered .
the administration speed should be directed at the patient &apos;s request , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ directed Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of inhibit@@ ors is cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk is greatest in the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decrease of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels was observed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time , and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed difficult to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , in none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O @-@ cell protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms indicated , indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients reported cases of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency unknown ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated Factor X by Factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in previously treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic value of factor VI@@ II @-@ Activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has further evaluated the benefit @-@ risk assessment as a positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s security profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , and decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited officially notified the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company receives its application for approval for the placing of an attorney for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ end@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified in such a way that it does not produce any copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infection in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene present in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient where Li @-@ Frau@@ end@@ i &apos;s cancer occurred in the lower abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered .
based on the examination of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ ent@@ i tumours benefits patients .
the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither to the environment nor for people who come close contact with the patient .
the company did not notice the CH@@ MP if it has consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a couple of hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main impact measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients showed their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction in symptoms of 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who were alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart @-@ hunting ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines used to treat allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from narrow angle glaucoma ( hypertension ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dosis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( stroke @-@ related strokes ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have finished .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within the 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ po@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , which are either per@@ oral or nas@@ al as swelling of the Rhin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ az@@ oline etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient population and the data is not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ol were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data is not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in the event of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of the head@@ aches ) must be removed .
caution advised in the treatment of the following patient groups : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder hal@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests because anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vivo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies showed no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impaired traffic or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible oral procedures .
headache , anxiety , frigh@@ tening mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecule P @-@ Sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily did not determine an increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic activity of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period according to the overall score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma .
according to the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted using the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects dis@@ soci@@ ate des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the all@@ ot@@ ment of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
however , based on conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of lau@@ at@@ radi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance that can un@@ fold its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and lac@@ ri@@ mal or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach pain , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of inflammation of the liver , and cases of eye @-@ catching li@@ ver@@ iness have also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ zer for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup resp@@ .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes sy@@ rup , the solution to insert and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg as@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom ( score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us was 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progress and may be terminated after the end of the symptoms and resum@@ ed in their return .
in the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the treatment period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance reduction of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in impaired traffic or ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg per day than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study that was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Sel@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
within the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses administered in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study where des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the total core of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as representative of further forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , irrespective of e@@ ti@@ ology , is similar in the various forms and can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited by chronic patients .
as the history of hist@@ amine is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in the case of Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the itch by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wa@@ xing as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study where patient demo@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following once daily use of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
in vivo Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not identify any particular danger to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken irrespective of meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the remaining doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher levels of substance ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children aged between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that among children who metabol@@ ise normally .
this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance reduction effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup group as with the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study of adults and adolescents at which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were administered .
children aged between 1 and 11 years of age ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 ) were given a daily di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
within the framework of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not determine an increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials were not impaired by psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ics .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not lead to an increase in the alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance or an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated on the basis of the total core of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study with sy@@ rup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a termin@@ ally half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant drug ag@@ ulation following once daily use of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in the recommended doses were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III brown bottles with child @-@ resistant polypropylene seal cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at once a day to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ le can be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets at the recommended dose of 5 mg per day than in those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data were documented .
within the framework of a clinical study involving multiple doses in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily did not determine an increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
at a 17 single dose study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of side effects between the lung and placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ elled tray proved to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for the loss formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for taking , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined on pedi@@ atric patients , but in connection with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg doses in children aged 6 to 11 years .

the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irritation tests for the enam@@ el tablet revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irritation in clinical use .
the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children aged between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that among children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group as in the placebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported in placebo were diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , a single @-@ dose dose of 2.5 mg of the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution did not cause adverse side effects in patients between 6 and 11 years of age .
in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not determine an increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially notified the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to withdraw its application for the release of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine to protect from a stem of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily be spread from humans to humans because humans have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the part of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign to the body &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the immune system later able to form fast antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this trunk .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign objects ) was removed , cleaned and used as a constitu@@ ent of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are participating in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your attending doctor .
if you would like further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients unable to swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to take @-@ in , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed once the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus is to be addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines are taken .
for children between four and twelve years old and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
AIDS cannot heal , but can delay the damage to the immune system and thereby the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , which has been dos@@ ed with low doses , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors earlier .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo after 48 weeks , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors responded to the treatment .
in the study of adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase enhanced the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reduced the viral load after four weeks compared to patients who received their former prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded just like A@@ gener@@ ase and are health @-@ damaging in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines against HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the self @-@ healing immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have out@@ weighed the risks over four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee stated that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally supposed to be under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as only limited information was required at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted approval to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited company for the placing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ in is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the strengthening addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adults with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that it can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with reduced liver function including chronic hepatitis show increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions in anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceed the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ush@@ ing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of the active substance .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the nature of the interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the onset of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other conditions to which therapy medications were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. a higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis are reported .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , leading to serious clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , increased Body Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width a@@ generic are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are predominantly metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in an attempt to compensate for the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed very frequently .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus mirror and , if possible , check the virus load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day that substanti@@ ate the efficacy and safety of this treatment regi@@ mens .
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a closely mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study for use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the fantasy component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and a@@ gen@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dos@@ is@@ adjustment is necessary in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors would be lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine possibly lowers the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster a ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin , even though there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in increasing the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ AD ) to 2,@@ 69@@ times in comparison to the value observed after 200 mg ket@@ ac@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tors , may also interact with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to interact .
the patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs when used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on data from other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it can cause res@@ or@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme reduc@@ ers ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma seal of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy related side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the fluor@@ ine cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous addition of as@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced reductions in plasma levels while administration of A@@ gener@@ ase is expected .
as plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of levels is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with the oral @-@ taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while at the same time use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at this time , as the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose can be adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous addition of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .

in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r goes into breast milk in humans .
a reproductive study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the implantation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight during lac@@ tation during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side @-@ effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , rose early and rarely led to the onset of treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines used for HIV treatment at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg as@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated below the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ th@@ om@@ al fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients with 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s performed in Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ cu@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
patients who received 600 mg as@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to be observed on signs of in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g pol@@ - prot@@ ein@@ sions with the result of an education of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M for acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r tann@@ ed treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / V / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / V / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates , phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be applied .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic patterns with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients , where a F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 insul@@ ates ) , intestinal avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 insul@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early termination of a failure treatment is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study conducted with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) or a standard care ( SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly associated with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ negative threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of efficacy of un@@ blocked as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , as@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 B@@ ased on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ roasted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration the mean duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
for this reason , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was imp@@ acted by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of absorption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of in@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state via the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or form a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a single milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a ren@@ al function disorder should be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regi@@ mens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily , without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in dos@@ ages that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the orig@@ ination of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , which included bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical daily routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients was observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies , treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality both in the control animals and with the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus jug@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the strengthening addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with low or slight h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of the active substance .
a@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a closely mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended because the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors would be lower .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster a ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data are available .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ odi@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the fluor@@ ine cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous addition of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproductive study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the implantation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during lac@@ tation during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to be observed on signs of in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M for acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ roasted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while absolute concentration of in@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state via the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or form a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al function disorder should be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in dos@@ ages that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

toxic@@ ity studies , treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality both in the control animals and with the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabolic path@@ ways are not yet fully mature so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for use is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not occupied with patients treated with PI previously treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ in is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dose recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for insertion and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ar , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the concentration of active substances .
a@@ gener@@ ase should be abor@@ ted in the long run if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis are reported .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data of 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , a significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected following oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take @-@ in may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r goes into breast milk in humans .
a re@@ production study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the implantation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 55 inches during lac@@ tation during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines used for HIV treatment at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • For ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses , it can be applied three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment .
before bed@@ time , apply the thin layer of the skin on the affected skin areas so that it will remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo were either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four major studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible in@@ clin@@ ations have disappeared in the genital or perio@@ don@@ tal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption of the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only completely cured , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream once he / she notices it and continue with the usual therapy plan .
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub into the puri@@ fied skin area in the puri@@ fied skin until the cream is completely absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
in these patients a weighing procedure should be carried out between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ famili@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a stri@@ k@@ correction leading to circumcision were observed .
when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream to higher than recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation has been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experience has been reported to the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly after a treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections for the treatment of external in@@ clin@@ ations in the genital and perio@@ don@@ tal area .
although limited data indicates a higher rate of bid response in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of in@@ clin@@ ations .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od inside 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be judged after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered for super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experience is present , therefore the application is not recommended in previously treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicate that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ stick .
very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is available for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ic locations outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normally decrease in the course of the therapy in intensity or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical trial reveal that patients with more than 8 patients showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with care in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies , no direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / f@@ fet@@ al development , the bond or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) quanti@@ fiable after a single treatment , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period .
the most commonly shared and prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the site of treating the in@@ clin@@ ations ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme in the related side effects include complaints at the application site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the results reported by 185 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme from a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical study report are shown below .
the most common , prob@@ able or possibly associated side effect with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in these studies was a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the adverse events reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials involving i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream are listed below .
the evaluation of the clinical signs indicated according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme often resulted in local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / fla@@ gging / turning ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) .
the evaluation of the clinical signs indicated according to the test plan shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often resulted in severe Er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and cal@@ ming ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area .
the accidental one @-@ time oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia norm@@ alizing after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 phase @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in reference to a complete eradic@@ ation of the in@@ clin@@ ations during an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior .
in 60 % of the total 119 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen had completely recovered ; this was the case at 20 % of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
complete healing was achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 male patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od compared to 5 % of 161 male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at five times per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ally classified bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data obtained from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic active les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of extreme in@@ clin@@ ations , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not investigated .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drug in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and aged 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od to topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity of the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study conducted for the clinical application for four months did not show similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in painting three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the area of application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only minimal systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk for human beings to look very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active ingredient free cream earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

the study was mainly based on the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect in reducing the concentrations of G@@ AG in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the concentrations of G@@ AG in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of the lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vers .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to larv@@ ae id@@ ase or any of the other ingredients ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not to be applied .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , verify and , where necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , derived from the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ juven@@ ation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with care when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously preceded .
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ ents ) to be treated in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data is available to new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly referred to as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the Phase 3 study and its pro@@ long@@ ation with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table following the following frequencies : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial o@@ ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desired drug interactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 trial with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly severe exp@@ iry and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients were treated with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , and in the age of 5 patients with a heavier circulation usually came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days for patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until premature withdrawal from the study ) , no antibodies were found in 13 / 45 patients by radio@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients with whom it never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was detected in patients with high antibodies .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ing effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to imp@@ air clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even though the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is an adequate restoration of the enzyme activity in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulating sub@@ str@@ ust and the prevention of further accumulation .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an accelerated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected Fe@@ V and the total distance in the 6 minute walk .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received a further 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and disability , which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as emerges from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of feedback is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with H@@ ep@@ atom@@ il@@ anom@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was detected , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage normal Fe@@ V , range in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test , range of motion of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a decrease in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in 20 patients , which at the time of their inclusion in the study were under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe lead form and 4 with mean follow @-@ up ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe exp@@ iry form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe form @-@ form only limited or no progress in cognitive development were detected .
in a phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage regi@@ mens were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed below 6.@@ 6 .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients previously treated with other chem@@ o@@ therapies as the sole treatment .
to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , reduced or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ i@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( other medicines for cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months on the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell count on the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer times of survival than with the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each flow bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the volume of the necessary dosage is removed from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung carcin@@ oma except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung carcin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid on the day before and on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after every third cycle of treatment .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood image should be created before every donation , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking into account the balance of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value prior to treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased risk factor in patients aged 65 years or over in the age of 65 .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical studies , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone @-@ market res@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neutr@@ ality , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed if a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients encountered these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed when this drug was commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly har@@ dening of the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment course to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) lead to reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
caution should be taken when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) are used in high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min @-@ tens 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed be avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data on the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy except when strictly er- and after careful balancing of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects of the inf@@ ant inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and were random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in relation to the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural reg@@ ression was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the sole c@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted in an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy demonstrated a medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months with patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who are taking All@@ i and do not have a weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot break down some fats in the food , causing roughly a quarter of the fats that have been fed to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no loss of weight could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with bow@@ el passage , bow@@ el cord , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , passage o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or on ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the placing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , gre@@ asy diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich snack or fat @-@ rich diet .
as weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted .
patients who eat all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dose of this medicine has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma seal was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the levels of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene in the normal range remained .
however , patients should be advised to take a supple@@ mental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
following the administration of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a slight decrease in the am@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of known side effects found after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to Bek@@ le@@ mm@@ ungen with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after market launch were reported to have either no side effects or similar adverse events as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the lip@@ ase @-@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect is applied in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic lip@@ ases .
clinical studies have derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials for adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months .
the average cholesterol in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of accumulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ bi@@ ated dose was administered , two major metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ form @-@ leu@@ cine group ) could be identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and are caused by the fact that more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks of treatment , as you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet at this time .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutritional related symptoms : • Start a few days , or better a week , before taking capsules with a fat @-@ based diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms appear , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not store all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the cart@@ on . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

being overweight has influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
lasting weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les which you can also find as an indication of the packaging of foods . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at most per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should intake with each meal .
the amount of calories available for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • D@@ ue to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of accompanying symptoms . • You should try to remove gradually and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you daily only do little or no , climb stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means you burn 150 k@@ cal daily by movement , i.e. through 3 km walk , 30 to 45 minutes gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a lasting weight loss it is necessary to adhere to realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to adhere to them . • Essen@@ tial is a nutritional diary containing information on the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking al@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fat reduction and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
al@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient prevents binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong and moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate causes of nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted authorisation for the transport of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
al@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in exc@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting caused by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute ion@@ ization should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to a further chemotherapy drug , Alo@@ xi will not be used either for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chemotherapy drugs examined against tumours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ abine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical trial , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zin , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , Ran@@ iti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical studies , the most common adverse events associated with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( altogether 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least associated with Alo@@ xi , were head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were given in post marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar occur@@ ren@@ ces of adverse events were shown as in other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.2 hours ) were given , which was given intraven@@ ously to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron that were given intraven@@ ously at Tag 1 .
results of the studies with exc@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportion@@ ate in the entire dose range of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
following the intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that once a daily IV administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days , the overall composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable with the value measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the one @-@ time entry of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bolt injection for healthy dogs , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination cycle and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the period of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose in roughly 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given every day over two years , resulted in increased incidence of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al marks ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is estimated to be low for the human being .

June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the approval of the drug prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that has already been approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infections ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damage damages , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood ab@@ norm@@ alities .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon manufactures data confirming the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was taken ( i.e. no symptoms of the virus were detected in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ze@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns were expressed as to the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease fl@@ amed up again in more patients than with the reference drug , and Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not adequately validated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection which is accompanied by cr@@ ust ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ ations ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ man@@ tis may not affect this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together at home @-@ dogs , approximately 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or by infections that have been proven or presumably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small hospitals , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with un@@ infected open wounds the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected in vivo ( see Section 5.2 ) because of the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after a topical application on pe@@ eled skin or infected superficial wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 Once a total dose of 2 times a day 200 m@@ g. of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on pe@@ eled skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / terminated , between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman to weigh .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go had applied , the most frequent reported side @-@ effect irritation at the date of administration involving approximately 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly called Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al units .
if due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear question@@ able in the case of at least some types of infection , consultation should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to respond to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
absorption In a study with healthy adults 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on stri@@ ped skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of trau@@ matic trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the Medi@@ cation and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 pe@@ eled skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng - h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhi@@ bitions .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro examination of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in the rat micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vivo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in an exposure to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ographic application on 200 c@@ m2 pe@@ eled skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were detected in oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between 1 and 15 years of age , which are not immune to these two diseases .
ambient rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and is ensured that the vacc@@ ination existing in two doses can be completed .
if a ref@@ res@@ her dose of hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ambient rix contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine approved since 1996 and the approved V@@ acc@@ ine of Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are given children as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because ambient and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as a cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
ambient rix performed between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar at a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standard vacc@@ ination plan with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered at the appointment of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster shot is intended for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) were observed in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ vacc@@ ination , need a ref@@ res@@ c@@ ination as protection , as they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in the case of non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , in the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , containing 360 ELISA units with a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with immune system disorders , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels are achieved after pri@@ ming , so that in these cases the administration of additional vacc@@ inations may be necessary .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal result , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception , as in these cases intra@@ muscular administration can lead to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was similar to the incidence observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ isation and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to the three @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % of the subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the entire vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the patients who had given Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the volunteers who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combined vaccine with the 3 doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ent group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , with the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported at the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted for vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the serum levels of serum for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. , month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose of the second dose ( i.e. , month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the serum levels of serum ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix after the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
the immun@@ o@@ responses that were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after the end of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with ambient rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study versus both anti@@ gens was comparable to those found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was possible to show that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the booster shot of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion rates similar to the previous formulation .
the vaccine is examined for possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transferred by other means , such as bathing in water contaminated by wastewater .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be fully protected from an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even though the entire vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both V@@ acc@@ ine Ambi@@ rix is / is ( although you / your child may feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of a vaccine ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath , or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to quickly take a precau@@ tion against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
in case of a potential risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface antibiotic ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection against the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected for people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
ambient rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction is on vacc@@ ination .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child are taking another medicine ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / or if you / your child have been inj@@ ected recently / has or has planned this in the near future .
it may be , however , that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine needs to be given simultaneously with ambient rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
typically , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women are not given unless it is imperative that they be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very frequent ( more than 1 case per 10 t@@ ins ) : • pain or discomfort at the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ iness • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite

further side effects that were reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 weigh@@ ted cans ) were reported :

ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in traffic only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug are limited due to low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ ola can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defects or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ aps - split by several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered through a gastro@@ stom@@ y hose ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ ola could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ don@@ ym , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
Am@@ mon@@ ola can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disorders or taste , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ y in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information about this drug occurred due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete lack of enzyme has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) there is an indication for use if there is hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually by taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is necessary for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders as there is a risk of the origin of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat occurs over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal reproduction and increased neur@@ on loss .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a hin@@ dran@@ ce to the brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at 56 % of patients at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tat@@ too dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ tery top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dosing occurred in a 5 @-@ month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which , with intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day , showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an active met@@ abo@@ lically active compound , which is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of bi@@ ased sodium but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis is made early and treatment is immediately commen@@ ced to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues in the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative methods of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by offering a single dose of 5 g. sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis following specific indications as well as repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following the intraven@@ ous formulation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a fatigue or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in the plasma after a noc@@ tur@@ nal fast .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys within 24 hours of about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
following the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no compla@@ ined effects in rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ hip or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is necessary for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20@@ g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat tur@@ tles were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain cor@@ tex occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tat@@ too dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ tery top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram , bi@@ sodium but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ulate form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
during durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products which accumulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out for you , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
during the lac@@ tation period , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , aband@@ on@@ ment of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency reception of your hospital in order to initiate a corresponding treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood count ( red blood cells , white blood cells , plat@@ el@@ ets ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention ( swelling ) , taste disturbances , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin odor , rash , kidney function , weight gain , and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date specified on the cart@@ on and the container after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Avail@@ able up to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on equal individual doses or via a stomach fi@@ stel ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is guided through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon gran@@ ulate . • Incre@@ ase a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of tabl@@ espo@@ ons gran@@ ulate out of the tank .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of chest pain with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stroke &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in the case of a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI the patient was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in reference to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd approved for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift @-@ inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours according to clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt release of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of an allergy @-@ free application of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed and the bol@@ us dose is quickly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate ren@@ al function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the biop@@ repar@@ ation of the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adaptation at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or an increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hypertension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
although most hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in arter@@ ial points occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) may be bleeding during the treatment .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ j@@ ine , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din reaches the level before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly checked .
animal experimental studies are insufficient in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding , such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding were significantly less frequent in Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following occur@@ ren@@ ces : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point of point , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed bleeding locations that occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose , or neck .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ j@@ ine in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding were significantly less frequent in Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above were reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ j@@ ine can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ j@@ ine , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , on its part , slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with serum of patients with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation reaction .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is supported by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI has been carried out below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ leverage ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required an angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly across the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent an angi@@ ography within 72 hours .
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ day and the 1- year end@@ point for the overall population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients receiving aspir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l according to protocol ( prior to angi@@ ography or PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on four @-@ fold and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous correlation ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is a pe@@ p@@ tide cat@@ abol@@ ism into its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent recycling of amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabol@@ ite , which results from the spl@@ itting of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ in , is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in .
the elimination takes place in patients with normal ren@@ al function after a first order process with a half @-@ life time of 25 ± 12 minutes .
based on conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks at an exposure to 10 @-@ times of the clinical ste@@ ady state plasma concentration ) was limited to over@@ shooting pharmac@@ ological effects .
side effects due to a longer @-@ term physiological burden than reaction to non @-@ hom@@ ec@@ ost@@ atic co@@ ag@@ ulation were not observed after short exposure comparable to those in clinical application , even at very much higher dosage .

An@@ gi@@ ox is a freeze @-@ dried powder in single dose per@@ ch bottles of type 1 glass to 10 ml , which is sealed with a but@@ yl rubber stop@@ per and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium .
5 ml of sterile water for injection purposes are put into a water bottle of An@@ gi@@ ox and easily swi@@ v@@ elled until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear .
5 ml are removed from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or given as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot operate insulin effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was found after six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ ec@@ onds .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh , or the delta muscle or by sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection into the area of the abdominal cavity .
due to reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin demand in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced .
any change of active strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ ar@@ ded , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method may result in a change in insulin demand .
3 A inadequate dose or termination of treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the actual profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment schem@@ as are changed .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic acid and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effects of symp@@ a@@ thetic polym@@ eri@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ vo@@ c , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation can be weakened or absent .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine is not known in human breast milk , but insulin is generally not absorbed into breast milk nor res@@ or@@ bed after oral application .
listed below are the un@@ desirable strains of medic@@ ating known from clinical studies , group@@ ed according to the decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 100 ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration difficulties , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive dog , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is neg@@ li@@ gible to continuously change the injection unit within the injection range , as a result , li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by a doctor &apos;s intraven@@ ous administration of glucose .
after glu@@ ing the patient , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ines the effect occurs faster and the time of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em regul@@ it@@ ol .
in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine showed a proportion@@ ate glucose effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ enk@@ enden effect , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine has twice as rapid effect as a normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucose healing effect about 2 hours earlier than a human insulin .
from the data it became apparent that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postoperative gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as with a human regulator that is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was swal@@ lowed in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ den@@ ial control was reached than with a human insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as with a human regulator , which is given 2 mi@@ ds before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to a human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at dosage 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
