<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Beverage Report (EPAR) explaining how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the trials conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or their treatment, please read the packing supplement (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like further information on the basis of the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melt tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. If thinking and talking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusion; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder where the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternating with periods of normal atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used to quickly control increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to inhale or melt the enamel tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who simultaneously take other medicines that are mined in the same way as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by means of "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that facilitate the communication of neurons among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazole is probably mainly known as" "" "partial Agony" "" "for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters act to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies with 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, suffering from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, more than twelve weeks ago, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a trial of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the changes in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbed the enamel tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both trials with injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased unease compared to patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, for up to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered additionally to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even more effective than placebo, Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses reduced the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled sugar), drowsiness (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and in which the manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in quick monitoring of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In view of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after menopause, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazl should be applied with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose to hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports on dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia are encountered in a patient treated with Abilify should be considered to reduce the dose or to cancel treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">So Aripiprazl should be used with care in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for unwanted cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in relation to deteriorating glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to coma bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other central acting medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically inrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' metabolites the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan-ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and the concerns arising in the reproductive studies at the animal, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, the patients should be warned against using dangerous machines, including vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazl has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - A controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total of lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients with Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, with potential clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters, showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">CPK increases (creatine phosphokinase), in general temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects that may arise in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and also reported in treatment with Aripiprazole include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose attacks, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazl alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without a death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is of benefit in the treatment of overdosing, as Aripiprazl has a high plasma retention.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder over the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HTA receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazl showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity for dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">Using Aripiprazole dosage in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the nucleus caudatus and on the putt.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 the responder's share of response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazl group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double-blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks involving 314 patients and in which primary study target 'weight gain' was included in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed a placebo-superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed doses with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy over placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy superior to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, in week 12, Aripiprazl showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase prior to randomization, Aripiprazl showed superior superiority to the prevention of bipolar response, mainly in the prevention of a fall into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for Dehydration and Hydroxylic of Aripiprazl, the N-Dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination cycle is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl for extensive metabolites using CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites above CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazl there are no differences in the pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-up-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics gave no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazl were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with varying hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety spharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and for the canogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the Hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in Galle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of Hydroxy- Aripiprazl found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in Gall of monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3- and 11x of the middle steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">As soon as it is clinically appropriate, the treatment with Aripiprazl injection solution should be terminated and commenced with the oral application of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the absorption and minimise variability, an injection in the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle is recommended under circumvention of adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If an additional oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify enamel tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution in patients with detoxicity and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution, the patients should be observed in terms of extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazl should be applied with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose to hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occured during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in relation to deteriorating glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and bipolar mania due to coma bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater than that of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy subjects Aripiprazl (15 mg dosage) was used intramuscular as one-time indication and which simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">With CYP2D6 'bad' metabolites, compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) received intramuscular, the intensity of sedation was greater compared with the after allsome gift of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Aripiprazl injection solution more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse events (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, with potential clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters, showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">CPK increases (creatinphosphokinase), in general temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Side effects that may arise in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and also reported in treatment with Aripiprazole include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose attacks, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazl injection solution associated with statistically significant greater improvements of agitis / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agitis and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of atoxicity and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from initial value on PANSS Excitement Component score for the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe toxicity, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the population population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 the responder's share of response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg-depression rate were significantly stronger than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double-blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week extension in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase prior to randomization, Aripiprazl complained about the prevention of bipolar response, mainly in the prevention of a return to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazl AUC is 90% larger than the AUC after the dose of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazl injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15- and 5 times over the maximum humanizing exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after IV application, no safety-related concerns after maternal exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) were beyond the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional trials with Aripiprazl (oral) for safety spharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and for the canogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans; thus, they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent branch-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the Hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in Galle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters of which had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in any form or as monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared with 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If one considers only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who previously had other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed in relation to these indicators that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel drugs in patients with the first treatment and that unlike other paclitaxel drugs it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted approval to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the placing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophene number &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy grade 3, the treatment can be interrupted until an improvement is reached in degrees 1 or 2, and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies were carried out with patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bonded nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel, which could have considerably different pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient must not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">No renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated in the patients until the neutrophine number rose again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly marked cardiotoxicity has not been proven, cardiac occurrences in the patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If there is nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in the patients after the treatment, they can be treated with the usual anti-emetic and constipating agents.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable method of contraception during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to treatment of blockage, as the therapy with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very frequent) and dizziness (frequent) that can affect the traffic jam and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and major incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pivotal clinical phase III trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most eye-catching important hematological toxicity (reported at 79% of patients) and was fast reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed at 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 lists the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased blood sugar, elevated blood sugar, elevated phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, painful gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding diseases of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, flank pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimkrotubules substance that promotes the accumulation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminary receptor and a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the tumor area due to the albuminous protein acidic rich in cysteine.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unblinded studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a negative overall condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for the decay of baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to the IV administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft-point connection of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-dosage (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urine excretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the total dose of α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available on patients at the age of 75, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic drug and, as with other potentially toxic substances, caution should be observed when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, it is slowly injected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution into an Abraxane flow bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the flow bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid material.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the flow bottle should be slowly and carefully swivelled and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes until a full suspension of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitation or sinuses are visible, the flow bottle must be inverted gently in order to achieve a complete reset before applying.</seg>
<seg id="330">The exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated and the corresponding quantity of the reconstituted Abraxane is injected into an empty, sterile PVC or non-PVC infusion bag.</seg>

<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood iron values in which complications may occur in connection with a blood transfusion, if a blood-blood donation is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with streamed streamed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a self-blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection may also be performed by the patient or his caregiver, provided that they have received adequate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by erythropoietine deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced into which it is capable of forming epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In the case of an injection, Abseamed was compared to a primary study involving 479 patients suffering from an anemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to streamed streamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between 25 and 29 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study where the effects of streamed streamed streamed under the skin were investigated with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study of patients suffering from an anemia caused by kidney problems, haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to seamed were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12,0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side-effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging migraine-like headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">It may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Flamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to make sure that it does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the rules of the European Union the evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces streamed streamed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company Medice medicinal Pütter GmbH & Co KG for the placing of streamed products across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned bigger surgical procedures that require large blood volume (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of external blood, Abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic procedure in adults without iron deficiency, where a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml that cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Hemoglobin concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients with hemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anaemia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and overall disease; therefore, the examination of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability of patients, individual haemoglobin values can be observed on or under the haemoglobin target concentration in one patient.</seg>
<seg id="389">In light of this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose can be reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose required to control anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anemia (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low Hb (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anemia (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week with intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anema symptoms and - following symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and total disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In light of this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose required to control anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the hemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte number ≥ 40,000 cells / µl relative to the initial value, the dosage of 150 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase is &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the Retikulocyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl above the initial value, the dosage should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.E. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte number ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl relative to the initial value, an indication of epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood canned is required, should be taken twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="403">As early as possible, the iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program begins, so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the seamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to flush the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythroblastoenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive any streamed or other erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastopenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboses (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial venereal disease, vascular disease of the carotene or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of time, defined as a reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the Retikulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes of non-contact (iron, folc acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium oxidation, infections or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticulocytes "Index"), is lower (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers should be detected, and if no other cause of a loss of action is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow can be considered to diagnose a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of streamed patients with a risk for an anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, the upper limit of haemoglobin concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins if the haemoglobin concentration is increased by concentrating on the concentration necessary to control anaemia symptoms and avoiding blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in hemoglobin should be about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestion insufficiency, the upper limit of haemoglobin concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">Tumour patients with chemotherapy should consider a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transsubstantiated) for evaluating the therapeutic efficiency of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anaemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on the benefit-risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated appropriately before the onset of epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosol prophylaxis as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, particularly in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that treatment with epoetin alfa can be associated with an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events for patients with an initial stroke value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy returned when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be checked and the Ciclosporindosis should be adapted to the rising hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies of tumor tissues no evidence arises of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF concerning hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Over thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, cerebrovascular attacks, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thromboses, aneurythromboses, atherosclerosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovasculary events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetic derived epoetin alfa is glycosiulated and is identical with the amino acids and the carbohydrate content with the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates the erythropoesis and does not affect leukopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="438">Survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 2833 patients; four of these studies were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and</seg>
<seg id="439">In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and the control patients.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin were consistent with anaemia due to various common malignancies, significantly higher mortality than in the controls.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications associated with recombinant human erythropoetin treated patients and in inspections.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolism in tumour patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a haemoglobin value below 13 g / dl, as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the reviewed data.</seg>

<seg id="445">According to subcutaneous injection, epoetin alfa serum levels are much lower than the serum levels achieved after IV injection.</seg>
<seg id="446">There is no accumulation: the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift.</seg>
<seg id="447">Bone marrow fibrosis is a well-known complication of chronic kidney insufficiency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyperparathyrooidism or unknown factors.</seg>
<seg id="448">In a study of hemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for three years, the incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased compared to the control group with dialysis patients who were not treated with epoetin alfa.</seg>

<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared with Risedron (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in serum (an enzyme that debuilds bone substance) normalized in the blood or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study of older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared with the patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">In comparison to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis), the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study of men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 from 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most Aclasta side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney complaints, reactions to the infusion site and osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The Aclasta manufacturer provides information for physicians who prescribe acetone for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains indications of how the medicine is to be applied, as well as similar material for patients in whom the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novartis Europharm Limited for the placing of Aclasta in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • The packaging supplement • Concontraindication in pregnancy and lactating women • Required of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When taking care of medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with low-traumatic hip fracture the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment with Aclasta's disease, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oralem or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see Section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin-clearing &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years old) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on safety and effectiveness are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), as only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting the therapy (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid introduction of the effect of zoledronic acid on bone reconstruction a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget to ensure an adequate intake of calcium, according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids (bad oral hygiene) should be considered before an application of bisphosphonates with adequate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available to patients who need dental surgery, whether the disruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of Aclasta administration may be reduced by the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of suspected atrial fibrillation was increased in patients receiving Aclasta (1.3%) (51 from 3,862) compared to those receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal function disorder Zoledronic was associated with kidney dysfunctions, which manifested itself as a decrease in kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The alteration of the creatinin-Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as a restricted renal function were comparable in a clinical trial in osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatine within 10 days of treatment was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels that were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l) occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the disease-Paget-studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplemental amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to prevent clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the morphological Paget-Studien (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on preventing clinical fractures after a recently received hip fracture, the vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical study, local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, were reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the oral area was made public, especially in cancer patients, via osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental surgery.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study of 7,736 patients performed osteonecrosis in the jaw area with an Aclasta and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of an overdose that leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconat.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years with either a bone density value (BMD) T-Score for the Schenkelhals ≤ -1.5 and at least two light or medium-weight existing vertebral fracture or a BMD-T-Score for the Schenkelhals ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta significantly decreased over a period of three years and the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures after one year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a lasting effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density at the lumbar vertebrate, hips and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the Schenkelhum by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology At 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies from the pelvic sludge were taken one year after the third annual dose.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with Aclasta compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the duration of the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP after 12 months compared to the initial value and was held at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta therapy increased the BMD compared to placebo treatment at the overall studs and scarves at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% over 24 months compared to placebo treatment and 4.3% at the Schenkelhals.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study were randomized to 508 men and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to reduce clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% for Aclasta-treated males compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the yearly administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at the beta Paget of the bone Aclasta was investigated in patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly mild to moderately severe disease Paget of the bone (medium serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2,6fold to 3,0fold age-specific upper normal value in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg risedronate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results observed a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 patients treated with Risedron at the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach to 141 of patients treated with Risedron could be maintained in an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the peak value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearing from the large cycle with half-life t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination cycle t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Coledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance of metabolised substances by cytochromium-P450 enzymes is unlikely because zinc acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Coledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin-Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in the 64 examined patients.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function disorder down to a creatinin-clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the cioledronic acid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because for severe kidney dysfunction (Creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest unletally acting intravenous single dose was 0.6 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg of body weight in mice.</seg>
<seg id="657">In dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC) were 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with IV application, the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid in rats was administered by using doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7times the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated exposures exceeding the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects on other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, and the intravenous injection point occurred.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spontaneity in the Metaphysis of the long bones in animals during the growth phase with nearly all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the drug is not immediately used, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a substance called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the disease Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens made from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget the bone conversion is too fast, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising the bone structure again, ensuring normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, inform your doctor that you will be treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">When using Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have used them recently, even if they are not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta together with food and drink, you are concerned that you will have enough fluids according to your doctor's instructions before and after the treatment with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="679">Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year, administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an infusion in a vein.</seg>

<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg, which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an infusion in a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">As Aclasta is working for a long time, you may need another dose after one year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work longer than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration of Aclasta was missed, please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before the treatment with Aclasta If you are considering the termination of the treatment with Aclasta, please notice your next doctor's appointment and discuss it with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion often occur (with more than 30% of patients), but are less frequent after subsequent infusion.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and shivers, muscle or joint pain and headaches occur within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="689">Currently it is unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="690">Physical signs due to a too low calcium concentration in the blood, such as muscle cramps or tingling or numbing sensation, especially in the area around the mouth.</seg>

<seg id="696">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="697">Before and after the administration of Aclasta, patients need to be adequately supplied with liquid; this is particularly important in patients receiving diuretic therapy.</seg>
<seg id="698">Due to the rapid introduction of the effect of zoledronic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic, hypokalcemia can develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="699">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, corresponding to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="700">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oralem or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the infusion of Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Beverage Report (EPAR) explaining how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the conducted studies in order to reach recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest acceptable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resin or insulin, the present dose of the sulfonyresin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, making type 2 diabetes better regulated.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1,400 patients, the effectiveness of Actos in tripletherapy was studied; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced by applying the dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional dosage of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyresin was 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients, the patients who included Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in the patients who took additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory infections (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the placing of Actos in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor (e.g. heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, there was an increase in reports on heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, hypertension, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazone should be conducted by the clinical assessment until the clinical trial has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can result from fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a slight reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving pioglitazone as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sulfonydyno or two-compartment combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a reduction in visual acuity was reported under the treatment of thiazoldindicons, including pioglitazone, occurrence or worsening of a diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribing physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or occurs, the treatment should be cancelled (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in AUC of pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the reduction of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance in pregnancy with pioglitazone, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (cannot be estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and refraction index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone ALT-specimens occurred three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as under placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo if pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about heart failure under pioglitazone, but more often when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients were conducted in the group treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study running over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It has been shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time until the end of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite a three-month optimization phase were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c - value reduced by 0.45% compared with the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinine quotients was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slight, but clinically insignificant elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone, compared to placebo, metformin, or Gliclazide, reduced the overall plasmaterides and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels was found under pioglitazone, while levels of metformin and Gliclazide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this both by an effect on triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application are reached.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV contributes to the effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies have shown that Pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in decay (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination cycle of unchanged pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and all of the active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearances of the mother's substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies appeared in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the resulting hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal diminish, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">Long-term studies (up to 2 years) induced increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (male rats) of the bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other Thiazoldindions led to increased frequency of colon tumors.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazone or Gliclazide have been studied.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinin quotients was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both by an effect on tryglyceride absorption and hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was lacking its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that the intake of pioglitazone is not associated with cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily, if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly, for example, by an intensive insulin therapy, may change the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of thickness, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analogue) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA to insulin of animal origin) may cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when switching to acetone in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or other than their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">When travelling across multiple time zones, the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor, as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor therefore has to consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which may occur in a non-adequately controlled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with transient or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system Actually - peripheral neuropathy A rapid recovery of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5. an intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in blood sugar setting can, however, be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Skin and subcutaneous tissue illnesses - Lipodystrophy At the injection site, lipodystrophy can occur if failed to change the insertion points within the injection range.</seg>
<seg id="884">Local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma occur at the injection site).</seg>
<seg id="885">Immune system diseases - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disturbances, angioneurotic edema, breathing difficulties, palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / loss of consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia can, however, develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemia can be treated through the oral supply of glucose and sugar-containing foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a one-weighted help person or through glucose, which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum working maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire time of operation is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fissile (hydrolysis) localities on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional safety spharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended to increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature (not above 25 ° C) after the Actraphane flow bottle is removed from the refrigerator before it is resuspended according to the instructions for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or other than their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="896">13 Intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in blood sugar setting can, however, be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="897">The terminal half-life (t ½) is therefore rather a measure of absorption as a measure of the elimination per se of insulin from the plasma (insulin has a t ½ of only a few minutes in the bloodstream).</seg>

<seg id="1176">In comparison, this was 22% (60 of 268) of the patients under Allopurinol and none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuria (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Particularly in patients with heart problems in prehistory, there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that adenuric was more effective in lowering the uric acid level in the blood than Allopurinol, but could also cause a higher risk of side-effects related to the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in diseases that have already lead to urine deposits (including one out of the medical history known or current gout node and / or gout arthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum residual acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dose increase on ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into account daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe kidney function, efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents, the use of febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Since there are no experiences in organ transplant receivers, the use of Febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular disease In patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated heart failure, treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other harnessed medicines, an acute rheumatic attack can occur during the course of treatment because the reduction of the serum acid level first mobilises uric acid deposits in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. in malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan's syndrome) the absolute concentration of Xanthin in urine in rare cases is so wide that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During the Phase 3 clinical trials, slight abnormalities of the liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before starting the Febuxostattreatment and in the course of the course (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwas not performed any interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO-inhibiting can lead to an increase in theophyll-level (an inhibition of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen was associated with an increase in febuxostats exposure (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicine / indometacin / hydrochlorothiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be combined with colchicin or indometacin without a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient used simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study of subjects, 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x measured a moderate 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, suggesting a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that simultaneous intake of a seizurite containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide, delays the absorption of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a reduction of the Cmax by 32%, but no significant change of the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies let not close to side effects of febuxostat on the pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborns.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be cautious when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall febuxostatgroup compared to the Allopurinol Group in the pivotal study of Phase 3 (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an arteriosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects that could arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg febuxostat and which were reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once were listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with colchicin. * * In the clinical trials no serious rash or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open long-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies, 906 patients were treated up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients treated with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The related events reported during long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to indications occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported in the pivotal studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypotesthesia, conspicuous ECG, cough, shortness of skin, skin staining, skin lession, bursitis, protein urinary, kidney failure, erectile dysfunction, increase of the potassium concentration in the blood, decrease in lymphocyte number, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The active mechanism of uric acid is the final product of the purinmetabolism in humans and is produced within the framework of the reaction scade Hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a potent, non-Purin-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki value for in vitro escapement, which lies below the nanomolar range.</seg>
<seg id="1210">The efficacy of ADENURIC was demonstrated in two pivotal studies of phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients with the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with serum increinine value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x per day compared to treatment with conventional doses of Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x per day compared to treatment with the conventional dose Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Patients with serum increatin values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were summarized for the analyses. * p &lt; 0.001 versus Allopurinol, # p &lt; 0.001 versus 80 mg</seg>
<seg id="1216">The reduction of serum acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained throughout the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received Allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum increatin values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with renal function restriction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with renal function restriction (i.e., h).</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was reached at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences with regard to the percentage decline of serum acid concentrations in subjects, despite their renal function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney dysfunctions).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum harnate concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX- and FACT study) had a serum concentration of serum concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">Data from the Phase 3 open extension study collected in two years showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) showed that less than 3% of patients needed treatment against a gout (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not require treatment against gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the number of gimmers, which resulted in a complete disappearance of the gout nodes by month 24 at 54% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH values (&gt; 5.5 µl / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received Allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dosisproportionate increased.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, a rise in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is larger than the dosisproportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the Cmax is about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration was observed, provided this was checked (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) from Febuxostat lies in the range of 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma penetration of Febuxostat amounts to approximately 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsoms, these oxidative metabolites were mainly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid is mainly caused by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine was found as an unchanged febuxostat (3%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair found itself as immutable Febuxostat (12%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) and other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat decreased approximately 1.8 times of 7.5 μ of arih / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.2 μ of arih / ml in the group with severe kidney-sitter function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver Dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (child- pugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh-classification B) Liver dysfunction changed the Cmax and AUC from Febuxostat and its metabolites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase of bladder tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purinmetabolism and urine composition and considered unrelevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It was found that Febuxostat in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In high doses that were approximately 3-fold of the human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred, which was accompanied by lowering the rearing performance and a developmental delay in the descendants of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in bearing rats with expositions, approximately the 4.3-fold and in supporting rabbits with expositions, which amounted to approximately 13 times of human therapeutic exposure, did not reveal teratogenic effects.</seg>

<seg id="1258">If at the moment you have a rheumatic attack (sudden occurrence of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, feeling of warmth and joint swelling), wait until the rheumatic attack is cleared before starting with the treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be with everyone, but may also occur with you, especially during the first treatment weeks or - months, if you are taking ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe other medicines if necessary in order to prevent a rheumatic attack or to treat the associated symptoms (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding boosting vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who only received Alendronat (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the same dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of digestive apparatus such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (diarrhea), constipation, diarrhea (diarrhea), constipation, abdominal abdomen (bloated abdomen) as well as acid bumping.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients, ADROVANCE may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It must not be used in the case of diseases of the esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients unable to stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1287">ADROVANCE can only be taken with water (not with mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and related side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • The patients should not chew the tablet or disassemble the tablet in the mouth, as there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract apart from pyloroplasty, should be given only under special care (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal lines, were reported in patients under the intake of alendronat (some were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be advised to suspend the medicine in the occurrence of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrostarial pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with alendronat no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulzera were rarely reported, including some severe and severe complications (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonecsis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen predominantly administered intravenously administered bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available which indicates whether the use of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who require a surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE after having noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned at the scheduled weekly day.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be adequately treated before starting the therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antazida and some oral medicines can interfere with the absorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking Alendronat, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, alendronate in clinical trials was taken together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for the treatment of postmenopausal women and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or by breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronat do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonecsis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports stem from cancer patients, but also in osteoporosis patients.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, the serum calcium levels were up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and serum phosphats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>
<seg id="1309">Alendronat ingestion of an oral overdose may occur hypocalcemia, hypophosphataemia and side effects in the upper gastrointestinal tract such as stomach upset, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis or ulcera.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including either under-immunosuppression or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; formulations of the formulation or the regime should be performed only under closely meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of advagraf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of impact and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see below)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus tallow should be checked before the switch and over two weeks after the switch.</seg>
<seg id="1416">In day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable both in kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus tallow are recommended during the first two weeks following transplantation under lawyers to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate aftertransplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because tacrolimus is a low-level substance, an adjustment of the anagraf dose can take several days until the steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of the application For the suppression of the graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, the maximum duration of the oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advagraf therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dosage in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments may be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of the stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advagraf therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dosage in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendations - changeover from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted a transplant recipient of twice daily dose of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of advagraf, thus this conversion has to take place in a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), based on the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant After switching from other immunosuppressants to advagraf once a day, treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplants must commence for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients converted to advagraph, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is to be taken daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advagraf in lung, pankatic and colorectal transplanted patients, came to an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood circulation in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum levels of serum, a calculation of the creatine and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Change from Ciclosporin to advagraph when switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of impact and tolerability in individual cases under the help of full-blood tacrolimus-tallow-level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus valley level during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood flow levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from prograf to advagraf, dose adjustments, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or at the same time applying substances which could alter the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since advagraf is a drug with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The indications in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases, if the tallow level does not exceed 20 ng / ml in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of Tacrolimus in full blood usually lie in the range between 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant receivers, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which can occur in a sequence of tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; formulations of the formulation or the regime should be performed only under closely meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1442">No clinical data for the retarated formulation of Advagraph are still available for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft recipients in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, which can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is to be avoided (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber or septum hypertrophy, known as cardiomyopathy, was observed under Prograf, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malignant skin lesions due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who are taking Tacrolimus, symptoms of PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, cramps and visual disturbances indicate, a radiological examination (e.g..</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels with simultaneous use of substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose accordingly to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was associated with antimykotika such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macroeyelid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of the gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4 can impair metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus lowers the Clearance of Steroid-contraceptives and thus can increase hormone exposure, precautionary measures should be taken cautiously in decisions on contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus potentially lessen the clearing of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong its half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of transplant patients do not indicate that in tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors associated with treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding on erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it is assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus can be mediated by binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cell nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibiting of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a specific number of lymphokin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphokines (like interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which no acute graft rejection occurred was after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the patient-transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of bronchiolitis was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low haematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the untied faction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearances observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, mainly via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in stable patients (once a day) in proportion 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent haemorrhage in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method referred to as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced into which it is capable of forming the human factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advocate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, among them a study of 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advates in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood septic episodes with "excellent" or "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies compared to Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advant may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Baxter AG for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the Factor VIII deficiency, the location and the extent of the hemorrhage and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hereafter-hagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma seals (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute injury are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to Factor VIII, can achieve various in vivo recovery and exhibit different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII-therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should be directed at the patient's request, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in treating patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII-directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of inhibitors is correlated with the extent of exposure to Factor VIII, whereby the risk is greatest in the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestic known inhibitors development, after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of Factor VIII (5 patients), which showed a higher risk of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected decrease of the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels was observed postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the time, and both the factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed difficult to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor after 26 expositions with ADVATE (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, in none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%), a FVIII inhibitor was detected after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE treated inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed a statistically significant uptrend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO-cell protein, otherwise no signs or symptoms indicated, indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Four patients reported cases of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has further evaluated the benefit-risk assessment as a positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVATE's security profile, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, and decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company receives its application for approval for the placing of an attorney for the treatment of Li-Frauendi cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissues that connect, surround and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has been modified in such a way that it does not produce any copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infection in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the non-defective p53 gene present in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni-cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient where Li-Frauendi's cancer occurred in the lower abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the answers of the company to the questions asked, there were still some questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of advexin in Li-Frauenti tumours benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither to the environment nor for people who come close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notice the CHMP if it has consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or "Compassionate Use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "altered drug release" "" "means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a couple of hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years old, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main impact measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients showed their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who received Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in the patients who received pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction in symptoms of 37.4% versus 26.7% in the patients who were alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart-hunting), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (somnolence), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic active substances or lauatadin (other medicines used to treat allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from narrow angle glaucoma (hypertension), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyroidosis), hyperthyrosis (stroke-related strokes) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it can be swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have finished.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within the 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergoid, dihydropoergotamine or other deongestiva, which are either peroral or nasal as swelling of the Rhinology (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nazoline etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient population and the data is not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerosol were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data is not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in the event of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Caution advised in the treatment of the following patient groups: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder halstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests because antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazol were administered additionally, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor tests showed no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and the placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether or not desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies showed no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness that can lead to impaired traffic or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible oral procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, frightening miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordiale pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary stiffness and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecule P-Seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study of adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily did not determine an increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic activity of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period according to the overall score for the symptoms (except nasal mucosa swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetic of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">According to the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow balance of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted using the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects dissociate desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the allotment of pseudoephedrine is equivalent to exposure to an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">However, based on conventional safety spharmacology studies, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin does not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of lauatradin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and the pharmacovigilance system described in module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance that can unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and lacrimal or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you have the following symptoms or diseases under the use of aerinaze: • high blood pressure • heart chase, palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches, or strengthening existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">When taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not a prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">The use of the recommended dosage means that aerinaze leads to dizziness or reduces the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerosol than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aerosol than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take Aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, take the medicine as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratradin very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (difficulty breathing, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chase, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of inflammation of the liver, and cases of eye-catching liveriness have also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilizer for intake (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which in the form of 2.5 ml syrup resp.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by identifying the symptoms (itching, number and size of the squares, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body utilizes syrup, the solution to insert and the enamel tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg aserius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom (score) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria, the decrease in the scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius was 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadin, Loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials on efficacy in the application of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease progress and may be terminated after the end of the symptoms and resumed in their return.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with desloratadin tablets where erythromycin or ketoconazol were administered additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance reduction of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness which may result in impaired traffic or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg per day than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported in placebo were fatigue (1,2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study that was administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dosage).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Seltin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">Within the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses administered in the desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study where desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the total core of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated as representative of further forms of Urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, irrespective of etiology, is similar in the various forms and can be easily prospectively recruited by chronic patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As the history of histamine is a causal factor in all urinary diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in the case of Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, the majority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the itch by more than 50% was observed at 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and waxing as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study where patient demos were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients reached a higher concentration of Desloratradin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation following once daily use of loratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In vivo Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies performed with desloratadin and Loratradin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional safety spharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin can not identify any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken irrespective of meals, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The remaining doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data is available which support a treatment of an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabolise Desloratadin and experience higher levels of substance (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children aged between 2 and 11 years, which is fully metabolized, is identical to that among children who metabolise normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains saccharose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies using Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazol were administered additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance reduction effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group as with the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose reported 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study of adults and adolescents at which up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose) were administered.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years of age (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11) were given a daily diloratadine dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Within the framework of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was used in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not determine an increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">In a single-day dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials were not impaired by psychomotics.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not lead to an increase in the alcohol-induced loss of performance or an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated on the basis of the total core of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricted metabolizing phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study with syrup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminally half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant drug agulation following once daily use of loratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies showed that the AUC- and Cmax values of desloratadin in the recommended doses were comparable with those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients unable to swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to take-in, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asgenerase should only be prescribed once the doctor has checked which antiviral medicines the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of the virus is to be addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years old and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS cannot heal, but can delay the damage to the immune system and thereby the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had not previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase, which has been dosed with low doses, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used to take protease inhibitors earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo after 48 weeks, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study of adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase enhanced the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV resistant to four other proteasinhibitors, Agenerase combined with Ritonavir reduced the viral load after four weeks compared to patients who received their former protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side-effects of Agenerase (observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients who use St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are degraded just like Agenerase and are health-damaging in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines against HIV, patients who take Agenerase risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecsis (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the self-healing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of asgenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children treated with protease inhibitors have outweighed the risks over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic kritonavir, but the Committee stated that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously had not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally supposed to be under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "as only limited information was required at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted approval to the Glaxo Group Limited company for the placing of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules are to be given to the pharmacokinetic booster of amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to take-in is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution are not exchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the strengthening addition of kritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adults with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase should not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the intake of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that it can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules are to be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with reduced liver function including chronic hepatitis show increased incidence of liver dysfunctions in antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceed the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Norised Ratio), methods are available to determine the concentration of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to estimate the nature of the interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycolcontent of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be reduced to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported about the onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other conditions to which therapy medications were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. a higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and related metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemothrosis are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), leading to serious clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is assumed (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, increased Body Mass Index), cases of osteonecrosis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width ageneric are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are predominantly metabolised via CYP2D6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to compensate for the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were observed very frequently.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus mirror and, if possible, check the virus load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials dosages of 600 mg amprenavir were used twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice a day that substantiate the efficacy and safety of this treatment regimens.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a closely meshed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study for use of Agenerase in combination with didanosine, but due to the fantasy component of didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of didanosin and agenase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and kritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dosisadjustment is necessary in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended because the exposure of both proteasinhibitors would be lower.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other proteasinhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapine possibly lowers the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised, as Delavirdin may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer a rifabutin together with Agenerase, at least half of the recommended dose is recommended to reduce the dosage of rifabutin, even though there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asgenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily resulted in increasing the Cmax of ketoconazol in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-AD) to 2,69times in comparison to the value observed after 200 mg ketacazole once a day without simultaneous use of fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or CYP3A4 Inductors, may also interact with Agenerase, possibly to interact.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs when used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other proteasinhibitors it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as asgenerase as it can cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzyme reducers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma seal of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Isradipine, nifedipine, niodipine, niodipine, nifedipine, niodipine, niodipine, and Verapamil can be increased 10 by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous use of Agenerase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and intensify related side-effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluorine casonpropionate plasma levels rose by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous addition of asgenerase with kritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced reductions in plasma levels while administration of Agenerase is expected.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma levels of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including rhubdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of levels is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous use of amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be used together with the oral-taken Midazolam (see section 4.3) while at the same time use of Agenerase with parenteral midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at this time, as the amprenavirus dose can be adjusted if Amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous addition of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, an increased control of the INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or amplification of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramin and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous use of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of potential benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactation rats, amprenavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether Amprenavir goes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study on pregnant rats, which was administered by the implantation in the uterus to the end of the lactation period Amprenavir, showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight during lactation during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side-effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, rose early and rarely led to the onset of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are associated with taking Agenerase or any other medicines used for HIV treatment at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006) in which patients with protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg asgenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated below the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as laboratory changes (degrees 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fathomal fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stitching) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 patients with 245 NRTIs performed in Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or maculopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonecrosis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In case of HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Patients who received 600 mg asgenerase twice daily with low dose Ritonavir (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degrees 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degrees 3 and 4) were very common in patients who received Agenerase along with low dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is to be observed on signs of intoxiation (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures can be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral Gag- and gag pol- proteinsions with the result of an education of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemp concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is located in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM for acute infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir-dosages - as with other Ritonavir tanned treatment regimens with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance testing, genotypical interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, M36I, I54A / L / M / S / T / V, I62V, V82A / V / F / V, I62V, V82A / V / F / V, I62V and L90M.</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">In combination with the genotypic data for estimating the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor resistant isolates, phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance tests can be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic patterns with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir creates a certain resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral untreated patients, where a Fosamprenavirus (one of them showed a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir (three out of 25 insulates), intestinal avir / Ritonavir (three out of 25 insulates), saquinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other proteasinhibitor resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early termination of a failure treatment is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study conducted with PI pre-treated adults after virological failure (viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml) or a standard care (SOC) with a PI, predominantly associated with low dosed Ritonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-negative threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of efficacy of unblocked asgenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, asgenerase solution for taking and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dosed Ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>

<seg id="2043">After oral administration the mean duration (Tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal results in a 25% decrease in AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">For this reason, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was impacted by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of absorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir that represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of inbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state via the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or form a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered with caution if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase Solution and Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on a single milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of a renal function disorder should be low on the elimination of amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice daily, without the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, benign hepatocellular adenomas occurred in dosages that corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8-fold (rat) exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the origination of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, which included bacterial reverse mutation tests (ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations tests on human peripheral lymphocytes, Amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in the clinical daily routine by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, no significant liver toxicity in patients was observed in clinical studies, neither during the administration of asgenerase after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity studies, treated at an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality both in the control animals and with the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">Systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus jugation and minor skeletal changes were observed that indicate delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the strengthening addition of kritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with low or slight hepatic dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Norised Ratio), methods are available to determine the concentration of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be reduced to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and related metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increased, for Cmax by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a closely meshed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended because the exposure of both proteasinhibitors would be lower.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer a rifabutin together with Agenerase, at least half of the recommended dose is recommended to reduce the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data are available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Isradipine, nifedipine, niodipine, niodipine, nifedipine, niodipine, niodipine and verapamil may be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluorine casonpropionate plasma levels rose by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous addition of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, an increased control of the INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or amplification of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin of Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproductive study on pregnant rats, which was administered by the implantation in the uterus to the end of the lactation period Amprenavir, showed a reduced increase in body weight during lactation during lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of Agenerase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdosing, the patient is to be observed on signs of intoxiation (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures can be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemp concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM for acute infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Vice versa, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other proteasinhibitor resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>

<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for Agenerase solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) Amprenavir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">In addition, as no dose recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of asgenerase solution for insertion and low dosed kritonavir, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dose adjustment for amprenavir is not considered necessary, an application of Agenerase is contraindicated in patients with kidney failure (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glycolar, Agenerase is contraindicated in pregnant women, pregnant women, patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>

<seg id="2194">Although limited data indicates a higher rate of bid response in HIV-positive patients, Imiquimod-creme has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of inclinations.</seg>
<seg id="2195">The treatment of the basal cell carcinoma with imiquimod inside 1 cm around the eyelids, the nose, the lips, or the hairline was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are frequent, but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's complaints or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment break may be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be judged after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there are currently no data on long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment, other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered for superficially basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs no clinical experience is present, therefore the application is not recommended in previously treated tumors.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) have a lower likelihood of response to imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lipstick.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Very limited data on the application of imiquimod is available for the treatment of acute keratoses in anatomic locations outside the face and the scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on actinic keratose on the underarms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions normally decrease in the course of the therapy in intensity or go back after the treatment with imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong, the treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical trial reveal that patients with more than 8 patients showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be applied with care in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies, no direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy, the embryonic / ffetal development, the bond or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) quantifiable after a single treatment, no recommendation can be given during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and probable or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimod-Cream related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the site of treating the inclinations (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and probable or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimod-creme in the related side effects include complaints at the application site with an incidence of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The results reported by 185 with imiquimod creme from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical study report are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probable or possibly associated side effect with the application of the imiquimod cream in these studies was a reaction to the application location (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The adverse events reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials involving imiquimod cream are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of the clinical signs indicated according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies with Imiquimod creme often resulted in local skin reactions including erythema (61%), excoriation / flagging / turning (23%) and edema (14%) and edema (14%).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of the clinical signs indicated according to the test plan shows that in these studies, five times weekly treatment with imiquimod cream often resulted in severe Erythema (31%), severe erosion (13%), and severe scarring and calming (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratose, alopecia was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental one-time oral absorption of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia normalizing after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 phase-relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in reference to a complete eradication of the inclinations during an imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the total 119 patients treated with imiquimod the Feignizen had completely recovered; this was the case at 20% of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Complete healing was achieved at 23% of 157 male patients treated with imiquimod compared to 5% of 161 male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of imiquimod at five times per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficially classified basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data obtained from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of imiquimod during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non hypertrophic, non hypertrophic active lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the unhairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of extreme inclinations, actinic keratose and basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Creme was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic inclusion of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of drug in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and aged 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure data showed that the resorption of imiquimod to topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6-12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superficially basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the dermal toxicity of the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study conducted for the clinical application for four months did not show similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice in painting three days a week did not induce tumours in the area of application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since imiquimod has only minimal systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, there is a risk for human beings to look very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active ingredient free cream earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2244">If it remains untreated, it can lead to distortions, especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to sunlight during their lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be used for flat aktinic keratoses in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most appropriate treatment for you.</seg>

<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently applied, even if it is not a prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your infant during treatment with Aldara cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimod passes into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of cowards, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratose (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin with the lips and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with inclinations under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area beneath it (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before applying Aldara Cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>

<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause you to create a blue stain, or it can cause weakness.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas on which you applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Most of the time, these are lighter skin reactions which end up again within 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally, some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, makeup, skin tumors, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes at the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, heat or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, nasal pain, diarrhea, actinic keratose, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, body aches, fever, weakness or shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and therefore accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, complicate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines before administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly based on the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect in reducing the concentrations of GAG in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the concentrations of GAG in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions at the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement of the lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to larvae idase or any of the other ingredients (anaphylactic reaction), not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known, verify and, where necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the placing of Aldurazyme in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, derived from the Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where rejuvenation facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with care when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, due to the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment must be cautiously preceded.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the onset of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyents) to be treated in order to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of slight or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procain because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data is available to newborns exposed to Laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed with Aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly referred to as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme observed during the Phase 3 study and its prolongation with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table following the following frequencies: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory and facial oedema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesired drug interactions associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 trial with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with mainly severe expiry and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients were treated with a seroconversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, and in the age of 5 patients with a heavier circulation usually came to a seroconversion (average after 26 days compared to 45 days for patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or until premature withdrawal from the study), no antibodies were found in 13 / 45 patients by radioimmunosuppression (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients with whom it never came to seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine while a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was detected in patients with high antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibiting effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to impair clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even though the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is an adequate restoration of the enzyme activity in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulating substrust and the prevention of further accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via manose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an accelerated expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FeV and the total distance in the 6 minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open label extension study where they received a further 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and disability, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as emerges from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of feedback is clinically not significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased further proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with Hepatomilanomaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the GAG-Spiegel in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin) was detected, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage normal FeV, range in the 6-minute hearing test, range of motion of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a decrease in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were investigated in 20 patients, which at the time of their inclusion in the study were under 5 years old (16 patients with severe lead form and 4 with mean follow-up).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe expiry form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe form-form only limited or no progress in cognitive development were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosage regimens were carried out on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional studies on safety spharmacology, toxicity in a unique administration, toxicity in repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2347">Advice for handling - thinning and application The concentrate for the production of an infusion solution must be diluted prior to application and is intended for intravenous application (see information for physicians or healthcare professionals).</seg>
<seg id="2348">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-I- conditioned participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, however, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory and facial oedema.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very frequent (occurrence of more than 1 out of 10 patients): • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • joint disease, joint pain, back pain, pain in arms and legs • redness • fever • less oxygen in the blood • reaction to the infusion site</seg>
<seg id="2351">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the packing supplement will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2352">If the ready-to-use preparation is not immediately used, it should not be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, if the dilution occurred under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Preparation of Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • Depending on the body weight of the individual patient, first determine the number of thinning bottles to be diluted.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used in combination with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer that does not attack the squamous cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have not previously been treated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients previously treated with other chemotherapies as the sole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is given together with cisplatin, before or after the gift of cisplatin, an "antidepressant" (medicine against vomiting) and fluids (to prevent a lack of fluid) should be given.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, reduced or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetrexed into its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural amithelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (other medicines for cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another anti-cancer drug), both in combination with Cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who previously had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months, compared with 9.3 months on the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared with 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with cancer did not attack the squamous cell count on the administration of Alimta longer times of survival than with the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the placing of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each flow bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The volume of the necessary dosage is removed from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">The reduction of frequency and severity of skin reactions must be given a corticosteroid on the day before and on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first pemetremixed dose as well as after every third cycle of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetrexed, a complete blood image should be created before every donation, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose check must take place taking into account the balance of the blood image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients need to be treated according to indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), the therapy with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 dose reductio a haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so- on the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased risk factor in patients aged 65 years or over in the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatinin-clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin-clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone-market resuppression and Pemetrexed may not be given to patients before their absolute neutrality has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrality, thrombocyte number and maximum non-hematological toxicity as observed in previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 haematological and nichmatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed if a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetremixed must be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophy- lactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with Pemetremixed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients encountered these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion before the Pemetremixed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with Pemetrexed when this drug was commonly administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of irreversibly hardening of the reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment course to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g per day) lead to reduced Pemetremixed excretion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution should be taken when patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) are used in high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and min-tens 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed be avoided (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data on the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Norised Ratio) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- or antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy except when strictly er- and after careful balancing of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of irreversibly damage to reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed is transferred to the mother's milk and unwanted effects of the infant infant cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and were randomized cisplatin and Pemetrexed as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2427">From clinical studies patients with pemetremixed treatment were occasionally reported cases of colitis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal intestinal perfo- ration, intestinal necrosis and typhlitis).</seg>
<seg id="2428">In patients with Pemetremixed treatment, cases of sometimes fatal interstitial pneumonitis with respiratory insufficiency were reported in patients with Pemetremixed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2429">It was reported about cases of acute renal failure in pemetrexed monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients before, during or after Pemetrexed therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic antifolate that exerts its effect by interrupting important folc acid-dependent metabolic processes which are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as an antifolate with multiple targets by blocking thymodylatsynthase (TS), Dihydrofolatreductase (DHFR) and Glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are folatdependent key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymid- and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomized, simple-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleural amithelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had clinically significant advantage over patients who were only infected with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">Statistically significant improvement in clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in relation to the malignant pleural regression was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the sole cispla- tin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms resulted in an improvement in lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and a worsening of lung function over time in control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicenter, randomized, open phase III study with ALIMTA against docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy demonstrated a median survival time of 8.3 months with patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the influence of histology on overall survival was in favour of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non-plate epithelial histological type (n = 399, 9.3 versus 7.4 months, adjusted HR = 1,56; 95% CI = 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018).</seg>
<seg id="2439">Limited data from a randomised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data (survival and progression-free survival) for Pemetremixed between patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 540) pretreatment by docetaxel are similar.</seg>

<seg id="2525">Following the administration of a one-time dose of Amiodarone, a slight decrease in the amodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects found after the market launch of orlistat is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to Beklemmungen with regard to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Cases of orlistat overdose reported after market launch were reported to have either no side effects or similar adverse events as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on investigations on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects caused by the lipase-inhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is applied in the lumen of the stomach and the upper thin-intestine by covalent bonding to the active serine-rest of the gastran and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials for adults with BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with hypokaloric, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average cholesterol in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3,30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The waist circumference was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (output value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolised orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients the minimal systemic resorbiated dose was administered, two major metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-form-leucine group) could be identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alxi is used in chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there is not enough information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-Hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was studied at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong and moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In the case of chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 from 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the case of chemotherapies, the moderate causes of nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189) compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted authorisation for the transport of Aloxi throughout the European Union to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with highly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in excetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting caused by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be amplified by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon massage, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of subacute ionization should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required with simultaneous dispensing of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapy drug, Aloxi will not be used either for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapy drugs examined against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial, there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, Chlorpromazin, Cimetidine, Doxorubicin, Chinidine, Ranitidine, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common adverse events associated with a dose of 250 micrograms (altogether 633 patients), which were at least associated with Aloxi, were headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were given in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar occurrences of adverse events were shown as in other dosing groups; there were no dose-effective relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume a dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for an Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients who received a moderate-emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 micrograms or 750 micrograms of dolasetron (half-life 7.2 hours) were given, which was given intravenously to day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg of Ondansetron that were given intravenously at Tag 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with excetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular degeneration and repolarisation and prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of intravenous Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosisproportionate in the entire dose range of 0,3- 90 μ / kg for healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following the intravenous dose of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean mean (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that once a daily IV administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron reached 3 consecutive days, the overall composition (AUC0- ∞) was comparable with the value measured after a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the one-time entry of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which, compared to Palonosetron, have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine, palonosetron as unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolt injection for healthy dogs, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal elimination cycle and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, but a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies, evidence suggests that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular degeneration and repolarisation and can prolong the period of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose in roughly 30times of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given every day over two years, resulted in increased incidence of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marks) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is estimated to be low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the approval of the drug prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same drug that has already been approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference drug" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infections).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damage damages, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminototransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon manufactures data confirming the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was taken (i.e. no symptoms of the virus were detected in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.zea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed as to the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease flamed up again in more patients than with the reference drug, and Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection which is accompanied by crust) and small infected infirations (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarmantis may not affect this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the area to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together at home-dogs, approximately 90% of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in treating abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissue) or by infections that have been proven or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections outweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small hospitals, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitization or severe local irritation by applying Retapamulin ointment, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with uninfected open wounds the efficacy of reapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2-3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected in vivo (see Section 5.2) because of the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after a topical application on peeled skin or infected superficial wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 Once a total dose of 2 times a day 200 mg. of ketoconazole increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on peeled skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical reapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Reapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / terminated or the therapy with Altargo continues / terminated, between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman to weigh.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo had applied, the most frequent reported side-effect irritation at the date of administration involving approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly called Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of Retapamulin should appear questionable in the case of at least some types of infection, consultation should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to respond to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption In a study with healthy adults 1% reapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact and on striped skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin ointment twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of traumatic traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the Medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, maximum individual systemic exposure to humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 peeled skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng - h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">Studies on the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma-test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rat microkernel test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in an exposure to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topographic application on 200 cm2 peeled skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were detected in oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3-times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between 1 and 15 years of age, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambient rix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and is ensured that the vaccination existing in two doses can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose of hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defense of the body), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and generates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambient rix contains the same components as the Vaccine approved since 1996 and the approved Vaccine of Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix are given children as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because ambient and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults were also used as a cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient rix performed between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambirix was similar at a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other constituents or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002 the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccination plan with Ambirix consists of two vaccinations, whereby the first dose is administered at the appointment of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster shot is intended for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine may be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) were observed in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons, who have responded to a Hepatitis Avaccination, need a refrescination as protection, as they may be protected by immunological memory even in the case of non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, in the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the administration of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, containing 360 ELISA units with a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and individuals with immune system disorders, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels are achieved after priming, so that in these cases the administration of additional vaccinations may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal result, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, however, Ambirix can be injected as an exception, as in these cases intramuscular administration can lead to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maturiness, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was similar to the incidence observed in the earlier thiomerisation and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccinations were given to a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared to the three-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50,7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% of the subjects after the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the entire vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the patients who had given Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% among the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maternity was comparable to a proband (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the volunteers who received Ambirix, compared with 36.2% of the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and maturation was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combined vaccine with the 3 doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-olds the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambient group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, with the 6- to 11-year-old, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported at the 6- to 11-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported severe side-effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted for vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years, the serum levels of serum for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e., month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose of the second dose (i.e., month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinant vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the serum levels of serum (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambirix after the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunoresponses that were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds a month after the end of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a two-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of priming, the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs could be detected over at least 24 months after immunization with ambient rix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>

<seg id="2769">In a clinical study in 12- to including 15-year-olds, it was possible to show that the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot be fully protected from an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even though the entire vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both Vaccine Ambirix is / is (although you / your child may feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of a vaccine), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>

<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly take a precaution against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">In case of a potential risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine (360 ELISA units of a formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection against the end of the vaccination series.</seg>

<seg id="2791">It may be, however, that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine needs to be given simultaneously with ambient rix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data known since the issuance of the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was placed in traffic only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug are limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonola can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defects or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps - split by several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered through a gastrostomy hose (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammonola could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a pseudonym, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonola can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disorders or taste, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammony in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information about this drug occurred due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete lack of enzyme has already been manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first months of life) there is an indication for use if there is hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually by taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is necessary for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or orniintranscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders as there is a risk of the origin of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat occurs over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">Subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in a slowdown of neuronal reproduction and increased neuron loss.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a hindrance to the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted by humans into breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at 56% of patients at least one adverse event (AE) occurred and at 78% of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactattoo dosis, severe hypokalemia, artery topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosing occurred in a 5-month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which, with intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day, showed dose-limiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an active metabolically active compound, which is conjugated with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine that is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of biased sodium butyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis is made early and treatment is immediately commenced to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the use of alternative methods of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Ornithintranscarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatically with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by offering a single dose of 5 g. sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis following specific indications as well as repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following the intravenous formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea fatigue or haemoglobin, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable in the plasma after a nocturnal fast.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted through the kidneys within 24 hours of about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">Following the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrat had no complained effects in rats treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken orally (infants and children who cannot swallow any tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastrostomieship or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is necessary for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or orniintranscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat turtles were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), lesions in the pyramid cells of the brain cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactattoo dosis, severe hypokalemia, artery topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, bisodium butyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate in granulate form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the middle measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products which accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of chest pain with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stroke" (an anomalous measured value of electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox in the case of a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine to prevent blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure), and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as ciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox in reference to all indicators was as effective as heparin, except for severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other hirudine or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd approved for the transport of Angiox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (instable angina / non-ST-lift-infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous infusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in another episode, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours according to clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt release of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of an allergy-free application of Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended, even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed and the bolus dose is quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate renal function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the biopreparation of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adaptation at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudin is given in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Although most hemorrhages in arterial points occur in PCI patients under Bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous Koronarintervention (PCI) may be bleeding during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with bivalijine, monitoring of the INR value (International Norised Ratio) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with bivalirudin reaches the level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregations) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological haemostasis parameters are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental studies are insufficient in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, binding or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, women as well as in patients over 65 years were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding, such as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding were significantly less frequent in Bivalirudin than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe hemorrhage was defined as one of the following occurrences: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point of point, reduction of haemoglobin mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding locations that occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose, or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bivalijine in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, women as well as in patients over 65 years were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding were significantly less frequent in Bivalirudin than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above were reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organ classes in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with bivalijine can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalijine, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds both the catalytic center and the ion-binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thromboin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Binding of bivalirudin to thromboin, and therefore its effect, is reversible because Thrombin, on its part, slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of thromboin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudin with serum of patients with thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) did not induce thrombocyte aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect that is supported by the prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI has been carried out below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, fractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-leverage (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to receive a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either prior to the onset of angiography (at the time of randomization) or in the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required an angiography within 72 hours, were spread evenly across the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent an angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and the 1- year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (prior to angiography or PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on four-fold and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of Angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous correlation (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin is a peptide catabolism into its amino acid constituents with subsequent recycling of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite, which results from the splitting of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombin, is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thromboin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination takes place in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a half-life time of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional safety spharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks at an exposure to 10-times of the clinical steady state plasma concentration) was limited to overshooting pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects due to a longer-term physiological burden than reaction to non-homecostatic coagulation were not observed after short exposure comparable to those in clinical application, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or given as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisine differs very slightly from the human insulin, and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot operate insulin effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was found after six months compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin liseconds.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh, or the delta muscle or by subcutaneous injection into the area of the abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin demand in patients with reduced liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of active strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc retarded, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method may result in a change in insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dose or termination of treatment, particularly in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of hypoglycaemia depends on the actual profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment schemas are changed.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, monamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxylic acid and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effects of sympathetic polymeritics such as beta blockers, cllonidin, guanethidin and reservoc, the symptoms of adrenergic antiregulation can be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">Insulin lulisine is not known in human breast milk, but insulin is generally not absorbed into breast milk nor resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesirable strains of medicating known from clinical studies, grouped according to the decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 100; not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration difficulties, drowsiness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is negligible to continuously change the injection unit within the injection range, as a result, lipodystrophy can occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by a doctor's intravenous administration of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluing the patient, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially by skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisines the effect occurs faster and the time of action is shorter than with hu- manem regulitol.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus insulin lulisine showed a proportionate glucose effect in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosesenkenden effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisine has twice as rapid effect as a normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucose healing effect about 2 hours earlier than a human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it became apparent that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postoperative glycaemic control is achieved, such as with a human regulator that is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was swallowed in 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-dendenial control was reached than with a human insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisis applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, such as with a human regulator, which is given 2 mids before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin for 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to a human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at dosage 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after) after the start of the meal compared to human nor- malinsulin which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
