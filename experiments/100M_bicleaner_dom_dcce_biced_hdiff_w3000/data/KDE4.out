you can translate the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras website . select the source and target language of the translation from the list @-@ up list .
if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated in place of the complete &amp; URL ;
machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Baby@@ lon@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations do not make important decisions dependent without checking the translation in advance .
only web@@ pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can insert texts that can be translated directly .
the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; making them easier to use .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual at &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Add extensions ... Open the box tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of default setup modules from the Box ; add@@ ons . please note that if you have additional software installed , you may need more modules on your system .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras crashes . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes if available .
the module view filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Manual filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ aries , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to graphi@@ cally represent ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can display either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ elled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle .
for tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be comp@@ lied with that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always comp@@ lied with . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of the entries , and this framework will need space , which will then be lost for the frame , if the rect@@ angle is square .
how to partition the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is always advantageous for lab@@ eling and avoiding space losses through boxes to create rec@@ tan@@ gles that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the Picture Gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you open the image gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can define the image of the gallery .
the Tit@@ le of the page allows you to adjust the title of the gallery page in a text input box .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a rotating field to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each row in the gallery .
with the check box fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , specify whether the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the check box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be stored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sub@@ folder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check box , you can set the sub @-@ folders to which level the sub@@ folders will be included . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the check box original pictures you can copy whether the original pictures should be copied to the gallery .
using the comments file check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures in the check box &apos;s own color depth .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; Settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use it to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or the lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to report problems or improvement suggestions as easily as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu contains an entry problems or wishes . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error report system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would encourage you to ask questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also edit the digi@@ kam ; visit homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to log in to the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
if you want to launch &amp; digi@@ kam , start for the first time , you will be asked where to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter path names or click the folder icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the dat@@ ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path will remain the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also use as an al@@ ben@@ library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; consider each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ st recur@@ sively recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folder . this can be done by adding a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change those by taking any photo from the album and putting it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can edit and edit your digital camera . after that you should learn how to use My Albums and My Wor@@ ds to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; possibly handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu Help .
how to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h decoder settings and ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , exten@@ di@@ ble software collection for digital cameras which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , and digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes were made in &amp; digi@@ kam .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
moving and dropping images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the tree tree , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only restriction is that an image cannot be placed in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , raw , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos taken by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , sorted by the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date on which the album was created first .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Import Pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the pop @-@ up menu you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right @-@ click on the album and select album properties in the contex@@ tual menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection from you will be used to sort your photos if you choose to add or delete collections from the toolbar or view albums . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums by date .
the oldest , average , New Year &apos;s buttons : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . for this purpose first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead .
if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; open , the first picture in the album will be a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this should help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another picture as an album icon , you must click the image with the right mouse button and click on the contex@@ tual menu &amp; quot ; As album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always only be included in a collection and collections cannot be desp@@ ised .
the Album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a bit while the preview images are generated . you can avoid this by re @-@ creating all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can edit about settings . change the albums page and adjust the range of thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse cursor a moment above a picture , the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such an help window .
photos are all about &amp; digi@@ kam . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can access all the features that are edited with you . you have the choice between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by choosing either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... Select . in the Edit section , you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . image editing allows you to view and edit your photos .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the contex@@ tual menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File menu . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image processing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the image can occur . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button to preview and rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo , it will be moved to the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del Falls you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed .
tags are labels provided by a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ste@@ quot ; to collapse so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so , you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked a new keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be added to the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and selecting keyword edit in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; change .
to select another picture as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use keywords , you first need to add keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; drag and drop it there . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select cue from the context menu .
you can select a photo with any number of key words . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to him . in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event in which it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Rem@@ ove from the keywords menu . the menu only shows the keywords assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a tim@@ ately adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection box that displays the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps , and more .
when you click here , the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filter what you have entered as search criteria . after saving it , it appears filter in the list .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be executed . the text box Save Search as is used to list your request a name in My Search list . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the form to enter the search will appear again with the search information previously entered . if you select to edit as an extended search , the dialog will appear for the extended search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the section The Advanced Search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the search context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are added time @-@ wise , separated by operators . an option can be added to the search group / search group or deleted from it . in addition , you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free hand sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or move it out and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window that lets you easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L The illuminated table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window is opened . if you are back in the edit window ; main windows are , you can quickly open the light table with L Extras lighting table .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select to sync preview from the toolbar and perform zoo and move operations on one of the pictures , then these are also executed with the other image .
another mode is better suited to pick up quickly from a series of images . if you navigate pair @-@ wise navigate from the toolbar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to see it in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal delete actions also work directly from the lighting table , e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the lighting table . this makes it easy to associate visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function , which you recognize on the crossed arrows . to wave the visible area of the image , you have to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode preview , both pictures will show the same image area .
the zoom works as much as in other views . just use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this is done in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been made to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital stock management . however , most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure , find , protect and use photos . we focus on the procedures for Digital Phot@@ ograph@@ ers die &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we look at the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , backup , evaluate , sample , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , assem@@ bles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you probably don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can access freely with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point .
holiday pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the metadata storage option in &amp; digi@@ kam the metadata settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? this provides &amp; digi@@ kam ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important .
now the real work begins as you now should assign keywords , labels and a rating to every photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos in further work .
now let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ ged pictures from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically set up the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graph shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to descriptions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to share your photos , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming , associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who consider your photos the title might be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help Him over the subject that you moved has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE provides you even a spell ch@@ ecker .
remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips by means of pictures with geographic data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files which you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a copy@@ rights with copyright and den@@ otes practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply to all changed versions , thus also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information is in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title : associated with the author . this field contains the job title of the photographer . examples can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a reference to the author &apos;s field , it must be filled in as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which you provide the image to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this , in the image embedded metadata . for private persons this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : plate failure , record failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion
of course we do not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which cause data loss .
to combat the problem of CDs / DVDs , these cau@@ tious ones must be treated and you may not be trusted for more than a couple of years . of course , you can also purchase CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece which takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and the check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanism of hard drives on this topic : disk error study
electronic parts of the controller are the most common fault cause , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT termin@@ ate the im@@ minent failure . these are especially reading errors and displacement counter . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems .
while most electric appliances do not make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , it looks different with computers with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause persistent key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware obsol@@ escence , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects .
the most widespread protection against spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . but remember that not every plug @-@ in strip also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , be sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be sure that all periph@@ er@@ als that are connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare your security in case of electric disturbances with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
you are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the relatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general security solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are provided on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version will provide you more , in case Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disorders remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day to open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection for this in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you &apos;ll see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the loss of data on not@@ ebooks and 46 % on job systems . not@@ ebooks already account for 50 % of the@@ fts .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been seen for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file is not completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ xel and a high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anybody else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by data loss every year . so , do backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before making any more dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane disasters : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring up your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two times : the one of the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time that such a backup has been made . this backup comes with an expansion system closest to the exception that is only scanned and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
backup important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or any other optical medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , image file saved IP@@ TC information , associate X@@ MP files , original memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ covering images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , usage of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you must consider all that is said today with caution and re@@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other option as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . all the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this always means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have budget@@ ed the scal@@ ability and want to increase the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # modify the size of file if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software to read , then you can create it yourself . this task becomes easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . it should therefore no longer be used .
P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard to replace the GIF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( def@@ late ) . it manages pictures in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format is adapted by many people .
D@@ NG is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it at some point .
this is probably one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits this as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it may cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI teams , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera panel , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for fine @-@ gra@@ ined editing , you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images , you should add the metadata again . these may be trun@@ cated from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them into Web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to get . in the section Add a Photos to an Album you will find a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use &amp; digi@@ kam your digital camera , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . for some cameras it may take a while . if the connection is made , a fer@@ tig indicator appears at the bottom and the preview images of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the view will be shown on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information that is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Met@@ adata Met@@ adata displays the internal metadata like Ex@@ if , manufacturer remark , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the images were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected is gra@@ yed until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an Option New is available . if you select this option , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you want to download the buttons All or use Sel@@ ected , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section . select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after you &apos;ve selected the target album , press OK , and digi@@ kam ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once by del@@ eting the Clear All Del@@ ete button . if you just want to delete some , you have to select them first and then use Del@@ ete Del@@ ete .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . the photos will not be put into the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; they will be completely deleted before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera finder completely , you should do so via the camera system , as this is much faster .
the file names are normally recycled after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames if you upload photos from different recording sets to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made to the file name .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for data @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the first two concern the data about the author in the standard auto @-@ identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you prefer a different date format than the default format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the option Date &amp; Time . for further custom@@ ization , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option Camera fil@@ en@@ ames , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer .
the new file name , which has been digi@@ ti@@ sed ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section Tool@@ bar , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam ; use this to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album when downloading . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar met@@ a data , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually turned off , and in that case , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the option Dat@@ eline @-@ based under@@ scores at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the selection is done , digi@@ ti@@ sed , queries &amp; digi@@ kam , where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers can it be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical allocation ( manual ) and finally via the manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
download the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to store these data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the geographic allocation module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ ison@@ ous coordinates that are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you must select in the Edit menu ; set up . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be set to include preview or start image editing . in order to select the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam , click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the title bar : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this may be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture other &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this means that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited and edited without getting lost .
save image let@@ tering as embedded let@@ tering ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . note : for images that already contain cap@@ tions , these are over@@ written by the cap@@ tions .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions is digi@@ ti@@ sed ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category .
the brightness of &amp; digi@@ kam can be set to the default settings on this page . however , each time you open the lighting table , these settings are turned on if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , you can obtain better viewing results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed pictures . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this mode of view can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression .
the TI@@ FF file option comp@@ resses the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the de@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the resolution of loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently it is very quickly developed into a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . this option marks the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera will be used . otherwise , if set , the auto colour balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . default is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the S@@ LR . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top lights , i.e. the parts of your images that are burned , due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights , as continuous white . use the setting through white in the settings . the setting colors trigger some unusual results , as they can re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the Spitz@@ lich@@ ens .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struction option , you will be able to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adjusted for each image .
set the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . this can also be made later in the image options of the digi@@ kam . to keep the time for the demo icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ous Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ ding correction since it is carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to give it again . there is also L@@ CMS and digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information from one color space to translate into the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files .
color profile folder Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam , then examine these folders during startup .
settings of the ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , e.g. Canon , which do not contain color tones mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated . this could correct you manually instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension allows you to recognize the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these are then passed by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the frame transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata into or out , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during ad .
the camera features on the left hand side a list of all cameras currently supported . on the right side there is a button Automatic Discovery , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
to use your digital camera , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and switch it on .
try out if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the Main Window &apos;s C@@ ameras . if you have more than one camera , you can paste them all here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving images into the tr@@ ash bin , you can set and edit the conversation between &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to save the changes using the button changes .
you can also add &amp; digi@@ kam the display of the welcome screen ; under certain circumstances , this will speed up the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
the setting Bei@@ m Start to search for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something is deleted from the base folder , queries &amp; digi@@ kam ; you if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . you can select these settings in Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs are defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam ; create , find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selection of the entry / Edit / Edit .
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before you have used Save or Save the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you might need to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ producing from the File Rest@@ ore or using the Rest@@ ore button Rest@@ ore in the toolbar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last saving .
virtually every action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting Edit back or restoring by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl , -@@ Z to und@@ o and remember C@@ trl ; Shift Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the reverse or restore button in the toolbar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions between them will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can zoom in and out in the photo by typing C@@ trl , mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the size of the window , you can use this button in the toolbar : select magni@@ fying factor
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you will appear in the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the toolbar will be displayed . if you do not want to do this , you can edit it from the Edit menu . see the section for setting the image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print image in the File menu and receive the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences . entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side bar to appear or disappear into the edge .
in the label view , you can enter or insert in@@ scrip@@ tions with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the in@@ scrip@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved .
with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the Ur@@ gency IP@@ TC field . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the key words used previously in this &amp; digi@@ kam .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword .
if you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to add a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the keyword filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Date , keyword and search views . if one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed .
you can also drag and drop key words . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to put the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Options Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can , for example , set an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you wish to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I did it mainly and edited it in concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable vari@@ ance from the actually photographed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the topic comes to color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons he wants to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image expenses are via email or the web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and life is so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus have to think about color bl@@ ending ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to list my monitor if I chose to work in a s@@ RGB color space only ?
yes ! whether you are working in a s@@ RGB color space or not , you have to list your monitor as s@@ RGB assumes that your ; on@@ itor is based on s@@ RGB . if you work as a color space of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting a further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Balance , Automatic Balance and Con@@ trast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic Cor@@ rection try to automatically make the most of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the Leu@@ st@@ amp values over the entire image , making the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test dot as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out .
balance : this method adjust@@ s the lumin@@ ous ef@@ actor of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . thus , nearly every brightness range has the same number of pixels . sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes either wonders in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channels . it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the entire hist@@ ogram area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ usti@@ fication of all values in between . this is only visible with well @-@ washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to complete the white balance of a photo .
the whit@@ ew@@ ash correction is slightly limited since it works over a color space with 8 bits per color . if you are too far away from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will fail better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it through the menu item colors White Balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right up , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even trim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings . the following settings are available :
the Over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Download buttons make exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the coding depth per color channel of the edited image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 bit coding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide to use color profiles can consult the chapter Color Management .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and also allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always need the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the color effects are provided by four color effects , a solar thermal effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , was created by adding a partially developed pressure to a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar process . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment eventually creates a negative image so that it cannot be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar heat effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply , it embell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an in@@ verse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ vet is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are too much for a few photographers , especially those of hardly any landscapes .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . for large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ance of the photos . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple den@@ te force / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on ton@@ ing correction to improve exposure . even though the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the sli@@ der for the purpose explained here . more details the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three slide slides into which can be cli@@ cked and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate is to shift the controls and watch out how the image changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynamically updated based on the settings of the image . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three controllers : the top for the dark sounds , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ pi@@ ds can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output rate inter@@ actively and the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create an extended picture as background while something else is visible in the foreground .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image .
save as and Load : with these buttons , the pres@@ et values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input is automatically adjusted for all shadows , resources and Sonn@@ ent@@ öne . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right :
modi@@ fier channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images recorded with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most useful . for images with large areas of constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you shift a wedge arrow to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the associated image pixels get darker .
when you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a dot on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and Load : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . every curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and solar tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color gra@@ dations of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing .
the channel selection box allows you to select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing relative distribution and rash . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own tab .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are shown on the right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance the picture will retain the overall brightness even if you change the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also activate the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me , because the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos .
sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour space . there are little noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colour space first .
the storage and loading buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can then be saved for later and then loaded . the used file format is the gi@@ mb@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was read@@ just@@ ed . maintaining the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image can be seen under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

with the digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry Image texture apply the image processing can be used for this .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or tr@@ inity of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed one ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; Add tool frames can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photograph is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the streaming eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . permanently trans@@ borders the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce borders it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bent down it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a kno@@ p effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio beforehand .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this also works in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . the larger the image , the bigger the character set has to be .
each setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved once , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the digi@@ kam ; apply mould template you can place a template over a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu can be used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template , there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template , simply send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you are using this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the Basic Fol@@ der button in the dialog . select the folder you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after setting the root folder for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears . selecting a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail preview toolbar .
under the preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
res@@ ize : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you have to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produced especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact , it does not shar@@ pen a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for custom@@ ization .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process must merge colors with minimal differences to one color dot . elements that are smaller than the resolution are thus combined into a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for home users .
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers are already using a sharp@@ ens image while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing focus . this can be called with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting Fol@@ f .
you should be careful , however , since the results do not work very naturally : the sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . under re@@ focusing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the image a little sof@@ tly is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove mu@@ cous from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often generate good results and should first be tried . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the blur@@ ring mask too strong , you will produce noise and the impression of gr@@ ates near sharp edges .
the radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should be best sharpen@@ ed in their final resolution .
the amount sets the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference sum . thus , one can define a minimum difference in this way for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore beauty fla@@ ws in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur mas@@ ked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ ry mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focusing re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted removal filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focusing reaches mostly better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in the image processing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the palate &apos;s folding . the G@@ auss &apos;@@ sche folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also dependent on the source pix@@ ies , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ itting is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should give 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
noise Filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor .
G@@ auss &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur is g@@ auss . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge &apos;s focus . however , note that the module will be very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load Buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not visible immediately , but later left unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you are reading and comp@@ ressing images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp masks produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king used a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp masks always have to produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of the blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Wiener filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the sharp@@ ness correction methods in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the sli@@ der puts the bl@@ ur of the area dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas larger values mainly smooth homogen@@ ous regions and keep details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary subsequently .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions while a value is fl@@ atten@@ ed close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD noise will produce a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG Artef@@ acts are best eliminated at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing over all@@ es. p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to calculate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle Dimen@@ sions &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integ@@ er step width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal . it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it .
the Save As and Load Buttons make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and later rel@@ o@@ aded .
correc@@ ting errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Canc@@ el .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied to a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hairs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter needs per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus minor bugs adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not remove the entire noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the Details Settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the Details Settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more bol@@ ted .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . when it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther , when it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear at the edges .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
the solution to draw the image a little sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen a picture . use tool for soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ ten and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local mistakes that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Artef@@ akte reduced : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Artef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Download buttons make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
below you can restore like a photo with uniform noise reduction .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected unter ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo , which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot pixels of photos that have been removed with a CCD camera gem . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark@@ image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the Dark Screen button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels .
the image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a spac@@ ing of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ quad@@ r@@ atic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of quad@@ r@@ atic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture can be seen under ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially the middle and large photo format , can often not evenly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ ading ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which increases the shutter speed under certain circumstances so it is impossible to keep the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should also use a center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ hei@@ gh@@ tened effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and film scanner , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a c@@ enter@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection Filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , reducing the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options .
if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the Edit menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient fourth degree correc@@ ts the removed corners opposed to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be virtually eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . negative values can cause distortion and positive values of cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ enti@@ ls , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the revers@@ ed character of the General .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image res@@ izes .
ligh@@ tening : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the sound or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or res@@ izing changes . best perform this correction as the first . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ n@@ ular correction the effect is obviously the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the sound / kis@@ sed distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the Edit menu from the image processing or the Zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motives such as shots from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the tone @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture can be seen under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate inf@@ ra @-@ red movie of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Fun@@ ge movie grain if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels for the reproduction of infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the inf@@ ra @-@ red filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the sharpen@@ ers .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the film licensing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from daily life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , then you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film licensing effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the film sensitivity used is ISO @-@ 1600 .

this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel big picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sket@@ ch . images of their gra@@ dients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch out . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower knob adjust@@ s the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Grav@@ ur shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , equ@@ als 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the shaft blocks 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one central point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image by rotating the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
movement blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera .
sof@@ ter blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by accidentally shifting the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color @-@ basin in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this gives natural images a wet appearance . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and the density of the drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can use the Edit &amp; Edit to keep an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will stay free from rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . you can find the tools in the menu Transform@@ ers Rotation or Trans@@ action mirrors .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how to recover the missing information or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select Transform@@ ers size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use some kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
keep the aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is present , as it is difficult to calculate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ading buttons are used for this purpose . each image can be enlarged as text file and later rel@@ o@@ aded .
infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can still last very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by adding a small picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison .
to cut a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you just have to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut out . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging it at the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply holding the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The editing button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save As in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview pane you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains unchanged .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned .
the tool Ac@@ cor@@ ding to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool Ac@@ cor@@ ding to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the combination help enable you to fade in , so that you can better compile your pictures . these help are :
harmonious triangle : harmonious divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ angels , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle aligned in similar harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden center is a division based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spir@@ als of a Nau@@ til@@ us m@@ uss@@ el or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; ab , where each number is equal to the sum of its two preceding numbers .
the golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spi@@ ral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third angel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the spiral line and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow on this way .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rect@@ angle is used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also diver@@ t from the golden spiral above . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not tri@@ angular tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place these lines can make a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame create an effect called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the Horizon@@ tal options mirr@@ oring and mirr@@ oring can be used to mirror the harmonious divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easy , that you keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the digi@@ kam , image processing and the tool free rotation . select to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the screen .
to your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have shot an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Transform@@ ers cut out of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally Cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after the turn . however , note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little gre@@ ased . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformer cutting from the image processing .
the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . for example , a horizontal she@@ ar will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane .
move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ aling , the image is blur@@ red a bit . for a single she@@ ar this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sha@@ w@@ ls are twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing the picture has unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformer cutting from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ il@@ ert have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system at this point . however , they will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF under it .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; only shows files in formats that you know . this is done by file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , then digi@@ kam ; modify this list of file extensions . see Con@@ figuration section for more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG for the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save losses if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ kam in the Con@@ figuration section .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . hereby , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that were edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; understands these formats and will generate preview for the movies . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing software and therefore has no built @-@ in options to view or edit movies .

K@@ IP@@ I module exports a series of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
if you swap the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast is already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the module White Balance .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam . your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft@@ marks , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , blur@@ ring , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture applicable ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontally divided without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizontally . the upper area shows the original and the lower one to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this box with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all adjusting entries from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page toolbar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Charac@@ ter@@ istics : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data originate from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or move it out and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and use colors .
the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; C@@ de ; Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Palette load dialog , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files .
the cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described in the palette view . here the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is inserted either or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions to copy , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ end sign , if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be past@@ ed as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs . graphics &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; programs are out@@ dated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphics . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; on . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; Po@@ sters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; bles ; the graph@@ ene re@@ comp@@ uted and in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; - Compon@@ ent
loading big graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knots )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for displaying graphs . required are :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar only contains the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; the main window looks like the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the uploaded file is modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether to re@@ load the graph or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; can also note your decision , so that later also proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graph viewer ; set up ... see also .
if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph viewer , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer , or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start , you can open all the graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as change later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on a page will be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph@@ ene distributed over several pages without head@@ line and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut store page gives the option to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or request the program every time .
the Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; to specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or choose to be asked for each start afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up additional options :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z and layout algorithms . the entries found on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ eri@@ ved graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for un@@ er@@ ect graphs . it uses the Fru@@ eh@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des in a circle according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can &amp; eg ; den &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; use special options , or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of the graph ( directed or un@@ executed ) and uses the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ processed graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .

&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you will find further options in the Settings menu .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid in which you draw the icon .
create a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears , in which you can choose whether the symbol should be created by a template , or whether you want to start anew from scratch .
restore the last und@@ o @-@ made step . if you do not have a step back , this function is disabled .
inserts the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current icon in grey scales . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de .
does not alter the symbol , but sets the current drawing color on the color of the point on which you click .
the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it displays the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
inserts the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three sides templates for symbols , background and symbol grids .
with buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove Tem@@ plates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc ; Change .
choose Transpar@@ ent pixels or display rulers and set a color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a banner . you can also choose the size of the ch@@ ess@@ board : the Kar@@ os on Klein , Medium and Great as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose .
reading the K@@ IP@@ I module images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry images a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears in that you can replace the default default duc@@ r@@ oth own to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner .
make sure that the window is completely displayed because some settings might not be displayed .
after you have pressed the scanning button you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 ; you must also select or create the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the Import &gt; screen@@ shot menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
when all your program windows fade out , the calling program will disappear , so that you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options already described above .

if you select the Change option to select the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at Maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF data of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same location as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have trace data from one place for images , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog is the coordinates of one call to the next you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the map displayed . select the region in question and increase it . always select this region and increase it . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded by U@@ TF @-@ 8 in order to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tabs in which the settings can be customized . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text displayed in the header of the HTML page will be displayed .
the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . the option For each image one page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg .
the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Suite that contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with other color depth . it also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail tab allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will be automatically started at the end to preview the gallery . press closing to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving on them . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been designed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture will be shown in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows for the actions listed below to save images in JPEG format without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found , for example , in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy from the main program and then invo@@ ke the import function . this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the module MPEG enco@@ ders can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Sli@@ deshow . after that you can create the module via Tools MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images you have selected are then listed among image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the list of images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to return the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the m@@ peg output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . once you have adapted all settings to your preferences , you can use the encoding button to start generating the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can quickly or in all rest enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back again .
if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the button Settings right below .
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is for example : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct print@@ out .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the key parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame stays the same , and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less capability of LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them further , you should not choose the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are secure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ ride existing files automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all the images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number of numbers and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images in an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size .
non @-@ proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
printing preparation : prepares the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo api@@ ece . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the images you selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog using the button Add images . for the last selected image , a preview will be shown on the right .
you can also drag and drop pictures to the picture list and add them to the list of images to be sent .
remove images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your email client . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments .
don &apos;t mind to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of emails sent . it might be a good idea to send multiple emails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted from loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG images in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is completed , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you would like to have shown your slide show will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ Transi@@ tions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file name option shows that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the images in the album .
the time interval between the images can be set with delay between the images . 1500 mil@@ lis@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends to the presentation !
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select another effect at any transition between the images .
during slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
on the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name , location of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting an image as a background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop surface .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with comments , you can browse through &amp; photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , now in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords entries are present .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have provided information when you have marked your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images are shown , on which both persons are to be seen . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of action .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save your own thumb@@ nail with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is of course also valid for locations , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture below .
to view pictures next to the names , select the button on the right of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide which image is to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you will need to open the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the respective person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you open the search entry in the main window , a dialog will show you that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can preview this dialog at once .
if you enter a string in the label or description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images will search for that text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be part of the total date , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here is shown by pictures depicting Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try out the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo if you &amp; photo@@ album ; for the first time start , or select from the menu Help menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then , some sample pictures will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print out this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo@@ album ; view the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics on the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively used in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview window .
you can also select a range of time bar by holding the mouse button down and moving the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ est@@ amps . if you select an area , you will only see images of this time period in preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides two possibilities to create HTML web pages with your images . one is integrated into &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; photo@@ album is described ; integrated version that can be created through the menu file HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described in more detail .
first , enter the title of the survi@@ vor and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; ch@@ photo@@ album ; export file will be created which is to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , all images are from a party .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why it is not dealt with specifically .
at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images that have for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set . so , you can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
it is best to select a basic folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible to the viewer . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to copy them manually . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all the sub@@ folders are located .
the settings currently described have related all three to basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name will set you in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; photo@@ album ; this work will not do again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images twice . first , it searches the images that are in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images can be viewed , which you can access through the Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the option Manual to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . because most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import ... menu , &amp; ch@@ Photo@@ Album will import and import the exported database as described .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ er the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window you will be asked which categories of the file to import are to be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to import with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture .
it must be easy to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you look for example pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will pass through the various steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting the information about your images , through ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adaptation possibilities .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it will take care of your videos . in many places in this manual there is talk about images , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; photo@@ album ; records all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the upper@@ most folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; photo@@ album ; records the folder where your images are stored and uses it automatically in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; photo@@ album , so you can launch a different folder tree with images , you can launch &amp; photo@@ album ; as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings are explained .
on the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . a detailed help is available for each setting , which can be called by pressing a button on the F1 key and one click on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete groups of members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , rather than all groups of a member as explained in the Options dialog .
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo@@ album ; shares its module system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access through the modules themselves .
because the modules are shared by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . demo database can either be accessed through the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help .
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible for some modules to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications put their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order by albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album .
simulated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview right now .
in addition to the current album , &amp; photo@@ album has to be released ; the modules also have a list of albums .
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a Categ@@ ory for Virtual Albums . so , for example , if you use the category People , it will be &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so if you have selected people to view and pass on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select which modules to load .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and toolbar at the top . at the moment , you do not have a lot of information , since you do not yet have any information about your pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; is the ability to display any picture with notes . this includes information about the people shown on the picture , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of images simultaneously . if , for example , shown on all pictures Jes@@ per and all images were taken in Copenhagen .
all of these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text field by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album ; as you will always use them when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , so that the names used are moved up , find the people faster and assign them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sort by date on the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add comments to them . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are under the preview of the picture on the upper right .
if you recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple Invent@@ ory at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
in the picture you will see a browser window that displays the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the comment dialog &apos;s context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag one entry into one category and place it in order to sort it in an sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a box by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which gives you the possibility to save the current layout and look of the window .
you can also fade out a frame completely . if you want to see this window later again , use the button Options ... and then hide / hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you do not have a filter . an example for this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it simply .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview preview . simply select the images you would like to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit Sel@@ ection menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo@@ album ; offers a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the images somewhere , so that &amp; photo@@ album ; you can record the images somewhere , so that &amp; photo@@ album ; you can be loaded into the database index . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images , where the right upper corner is trun@@ cated , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , the preview images are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can preview these images , but you can not view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; does not support you until now to avoid inser@@ ting the respective CD . so if you want to avoid trouble , how to avoid mess@@ ing up your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it .
in the Image menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those remain that you want to make for others in@@ accessible and click on Current View in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister may see , and select the menu entry Any@@ thing except current view .
this means that you specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give your little sister the laptop , simply select the menu item images , so all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be typ@@ ed to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Password in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images are on the hard disk and on the other hand anyone who can access the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d the view of private images .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is of course that you want to consider them sometime . for this reason &amp; photo@@ album ; over a picture and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in it . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have in the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can drag and drop them somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is to be displayed at all .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the matching entries for this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can move in the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply move a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out again . the Plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of zo@@ oming .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ oming . the same button sets the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that are in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key .
with the twist functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the image . at the moment you can view the view and open configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you might prefer to select only the image and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to display images with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view a picture with which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have identified features on your images , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just add them all at once with notes . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview view . if you want to view categories in dre Pre@@ view view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you are allowed &amp; photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can und@@ o your gem@@ old later .
in order to see the painting mode of &amp; photo@@ album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully rule , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu In@@ sert .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed for you to choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the whole texture is rendered even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross the box locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of view of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility stage selected in the toolbar .
&amp; sz@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can set it as desired . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below a given view , pull the start to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the start to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views of each other , drag the start right into the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the card icon at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view out of the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the cham@@ fer bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ ois bar . to prevent closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view can be saved with view window arrangement ... Save . a dialog appears , in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene click on the Ren@@ dering icon The symbol Ren@@ dering in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene render .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each ring mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it &apos;s a name that makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map file size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel , various errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super@@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the second method is adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is further divided and adap@@ tively because the rec@@ ur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre@@ defined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are tra@@ cked individually and tested for further sub@@ divisions .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to create noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last adjustment for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; that calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to let a scene calculate with this property .
on this card you can choose whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent then if the associated rays have not hit any object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently , &amp; ch@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command scope of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; ch@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document retention and version here . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) into the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene folder , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ model views . you can set the grid separately for displac@@ ements , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
when you cross High details for enhanced projections , all wi@@ re@@ model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you cross the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the floor , a bottom is rendered under the objects . the bottom is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when activating edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more details on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window instructions section explains how you can create and save window orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; ch@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting a selected order with the Rem@@ ove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created by button Add and Del@@ ete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the new column . with new column , create a new column on the right of the existing windows , with un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with tabs you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating anch@@ oring the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; Chi@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; ch@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols as well as their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu item .
the wi@@ re@@ frame view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the Apply button or the Enter key , the wi@@ re@@ frame views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , you see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert End@@ or Body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task .
&amp; Chi@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite layer as ground :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed .
the wi@@ re@@ frame view now also shows the level , if at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the level extends to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case you will only find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are a lot of different materials , but select something simple at the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please select the first sub@@ property . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment shows only a matte black material , because you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on Pre@@ view . now , enter the colors for the pigment . also , there are many possibilities again , but take the simplest one .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then click on the preview button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select mon@@ ochro@@ me each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should be able to do this step simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the ground :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or the button Apply ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor , as you have shifted the floor by one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering is now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select the first sub@@ property and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on orb Pig@@ ment , then select one @-@ color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the Enter key .
the brightness @-@ effect and reflection settings result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces even when metal is not selected yet :
you should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered by you and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
once you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last und@@ o command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit back .
save the current window arrangement and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; ch@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , key short@@ cuts and default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to modify or add new short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models will then be further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; Cir@@ cul@@ ation Show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; cow show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file type , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a suitable file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Con@@ figuration - &amp; Cir@@ cul@@ ation Show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , general and editing and slideshow , you can adjust the mode of operation of &amp; cow show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full@@ screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; cow show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; cow show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , a cam show will open ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this will be used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; nbsp ; so set up that only some of the file types will be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
here you can change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; cow show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
decreases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ick@@ show ; is also closed when no browser window is open .
view the original size image . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ Photo ; is part of the digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and modifications .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ Photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an item reports you problems or wishes . this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page for reporting problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ shoot , then we encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ shoot . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ Photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ Photo ; .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; try to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that make the behavior of &amp; show@@ Photo ; change . to access these settings , you need to set up a show@@ down menu in the Settings menu . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you should display in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ Photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . the same page bar can also be found in the image editing . you can view these by clicking on one of the five tabs :
&amp; Channel ; is an application for scanning images that do not do more than scanning and calibr@@ ating images .
&amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes them scan and save images . &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving for each image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; channels . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ anen ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window .
when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you preview a preview in the settings before saving , the image will be displayed in a preview window , as seen below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; through the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , the same named dialog will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option before saving must display a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be checked .
this setting allows you to select the type of each image . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; can@@ l@@ ite ; to save it automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved on the Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as the default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it using the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the images to be stored automatically , and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is uploaded each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; can@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE Over @-@ Dialog for &amp; channels ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; can@@ l@@ ite ; .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cut can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and setting up global short@@ cuts . you can set up the key short@@ cut by right @-@ clicking in the player window and selecting short commands ...
you may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions , most of which can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script is not running .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends notification to all running scripts . to do this , strings are written to the default scripts . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure Wide the script to display the setup dialog . to store and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now query more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( e.g. metadata or piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu item has been cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le are also passed so that the script can be used to remove the selected item . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed to do such as clearing up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as my@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation cat@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is ready , you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script side of &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the Amar@@ ok category ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just want to find a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
you may have already some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you need to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled in order for them to be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if the option is turned off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ s@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the m@@ ood@@ win@@ ometer .
create atmosph@@ er@@ ically : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ s@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
disc@@ la@@ imer files in the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , .@@ mood files will be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s preferences folder ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to start when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save the playlist when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved .
to keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece when changing the piece , causes the playlist window to roll up / down to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area .
changing the context browser automatically shows the context browser when the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section you can specify the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by selecting proprietary fonts , the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browser . press Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the Sel@@ ection Custom color scheme , you own the Qu@@ al of choice and can design@@ ate your own color scheme . to do this , use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreground and background color .
continuing playback at the start causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , the play continues automatically with the piece on the spot , with which it was stopped at the last ending .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can directly view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be shad@@ owed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . one click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the box audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still enable additional adjustment options in this tab card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folders and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Browse to music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to set up how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively search sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to browse both the selected and their sub@@ folders according to music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further installation in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . on Calcul@@ ator : will the host enter where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then it is entered under Port : the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
enter user name : and password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
the debit card last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if required .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can access the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of it to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager does the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by del@@ eting ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the file that caused the crash .
this is mostly due to the fact that tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more sophisticated .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatic switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens when crashing ) . if this is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a info , but do not label it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error while writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ inst@@ ated with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten . in some cases , you need to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most of the installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also help other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .com in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please bear in there only one mistake , if there is something in the repair of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , just a blank playlist will appear . how do music pieces enter in ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the interface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the valuation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show rating . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop it there , just as you would make it with other files . so easy is that : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the button can be saved . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it through the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s really true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back @-@ end independent approach , so the real question must be Which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format .
it can ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include MP3 deco@@ ders in the default setting ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the Multimedia Option Pack 1 . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in the search for the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you might need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ sink ) .
do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can not just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound system . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . follow the register register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - download , compile and install ff@@ m@@ peg , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the latest @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute the list register again . start &amp; Amar@@ ok .
please report them under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; find current titles if you are on another computer ?
if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command will give you the interpreter and title of the running part : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP address and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification exists in ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ isations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing Enter to search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the Control Panel &apos;s system section ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; click the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; R@@ MB@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers to display . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it opens up a file browser with several folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg instead .

basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a decreasing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall score .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the playlist window . there you can select the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , i.e. by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and pressing F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata dialog .
the developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified release plan that is not to be assembled with the short @-@ term scheduled Amar@@ ok plan .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon while playing anim@@ ate in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool bar . select Settings toolbar ... and select the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click New Design to install ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or Navigation Section allows you to monitor &amp; control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Con@@ quer@@ or . start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select the Add Amar@@ ok button .
audio @-@ rob@@ bler is a free service to send information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audio @-@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably need a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , this is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you get the error of There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
setting up Am@@ ok settings ... Audio output enter the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8 x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be looked after . of course you are welcome to take this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed super@@ visor for Arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection subsequently , or the wizard simply do not like , then this quick start instructions should be a help . with their help you &amp; Amar@@ ok will have set up in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag items from the collection browser to the playlist . enter the small text field to filter the collection and save the remaining matching entries . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the button playlist . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view .
to play an audio CD , please select the audio CD in the menu bar . it opens up a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the Play button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol audio cd : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just right @-@ click an entry and follow the burning menu . you have several options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally , some additional packages are listed which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages through a package management system ( eg RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a run@@ time display showing the currently running piece or the current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time to the remaining time of the play .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also under the running text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of playing buttons , volume control and the play position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the piece position or volume . with playing buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from Klassik to Techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you activate the check box equ@@ ali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist for all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the fullness of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current part . its appearance can be adapted using context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the under@@ window has been dis@@ car@@ ded . the information shown there are now available in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to follow the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng will be supported . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ es , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played right away .
among the suggested pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter . this section displays the five highest @-@ rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set what information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . to do this , right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , the artist &apos;s albums , lists all the albums of the current interpreter that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be folded up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the under@@ window text , the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - groups only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres will be dis@@ regarded .
if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Vari@@ ous Interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Artist / Year - Album - S@@ ort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically and are ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be shown first by genre and among them sorted by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change anything to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this could take a while .
directly below the toolbar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter there is a selection box , with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose from different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options .
load - This cle@@ aves the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
app@@ end to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this feature adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer the pieces to the media player via the Media Player . for more details , see the Media @-@ Player @-@ Browser section .
burn all pieces of this artist / Burn to CD - D@@ ue the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) To move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
select as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , and it will appear among various interpre@@ ters .
record @-@ Mark@@ ing - Chan@@ ges a record @-@ marked album back into a normal album . after that , the album is no longer displayed under Vari@@ ous Interpre@@ ters but again under the associated interpreter .
the playlist browser makes it easy to use many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created Smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to performer sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list performer . when finished , click Apply . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . when the commit is finished , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive integration for your iPod .
under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser you will find an address bar with which you can obtain music from a given URL . if you enter , for example , tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can listen to music in the musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window space , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping the shift key . in this case , holding the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist contains all the pieces you want to play . you can change the order by simply moving the entries with the mouse to the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter del@@ im@@ ited search terms by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms OR , search for entries that either contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR Two OR 3 . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) will be found .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a certain search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something searches for pieces that do not contain anything .
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 @-@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bathroom .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click in the desired order to the entries . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you will find the button Add to which you can add the playlist pieces .
next , follow the buttons to und@@ o and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar is a unique , increased analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set to the analy@@ zer by clicking the right mouse button .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you get in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume controls . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons ... Select .
the status bar displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and recovery , a sli@@ der for playing position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed . the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by double clicking the mouse in the appropriate display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . via this menu you can reach &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s settings .
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization Plugins window . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play the pieces : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details to set up these will follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio @-@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
double @-@ click on the playlist you want , drag them into the playlist window or right @-@ click on them and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix instantly fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist &apos;s Recommen@@ ded pieces start with an empty playlist and you need to add at least one piece itself from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can be disabled again .
the New re@@ fills the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings .
right clicking a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . this will open the dialog to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here , but the name should be unique in order to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming tracks will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a single piece in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while playing pla@@ ym@@ ate pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one playlist , add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add random pieces from each of the selected play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on setup .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . a select dialog will open in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you no longer want to use a script , you can delete it . select the script to be deleted then click Un@@ install .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore chooses &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality in burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
L@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . L@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , for example , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully @-@ featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this may be useful e.g. for creating a mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without the norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces will play differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and can automatically playback all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to rel@@ o@@ ad recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is shown , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . that is the same as if you would call for every single project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . in addition , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to happen with it , just as if you have called for any project file C@@ lose .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to happen , as if you have called a file C@@ lose .
when you open this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . that has the same effect as when you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can set up many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you compile files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already available on the media .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this also allows copying a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD , which you can then burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows copying a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD , which you can then burn later . also , converting / decreasing a DVD using the copy dialog will not yet be supported , so the target medium must be large enough to capture the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between write mod@@ i over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burning a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burning a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is selected , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , locking and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the Content View allows you to select and drag files to the project view . the Content View is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct auth@@ oriz@@ ations for burning CDs and DVDs . for this purpose , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator at the start of the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general application settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work right away . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task is crucial , which of the programs you prefer .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ ist , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ righ@@ d ( ) void _ void ( ) void bur@@ n@@ c@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which can only be used for data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String path )
thus it is possible to fill in a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; output reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on hard disk ) and many enco@@ ders that enco@@ de these WAV files . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are supported by default . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the tracks of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself . however , only the enco@@ ders need to be installed that are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer chapter provides a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device protects the protection , it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD ; in any case it can &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator . avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling for the reading of a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
converting to many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the step by step for example , there are more information on how this program is used and screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
start the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - when a encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup d@@ alog - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default . it should be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
open the file manager so that an already selected file will be selected to en@@ code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pi@@ ep@@ ses ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
open the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like encoder , for setting up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; gre@@ ek &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play back these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is supplied free of charge with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but lower bit@@ rates compared to O@@ GG .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11@@ 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or fet@@ ched through the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the encoder program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter the information , so that all the others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translator : with this the author is meant ) am not a lawyer . however , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is actively selecting a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with a different ( fake ) address than the one installed in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what selection program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more about it , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to note is that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened .
to save the read WAV files , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself .
the enco@@ ders package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders is in the Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer chapter .
after installing a coding , you can get more information about its switch by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read real to it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure of what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; trying to copy something inside with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ ders to be used to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change it at any time you read a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD / DVD drive is present , the effective device name can also be specified . if you can access the drive with other programs , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the General Settings tab . here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information please select , so that you will be informed when data for creating keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer via the internet .
note : while reading the &amp; CD , the computer must be connected to the Internet to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; . that is associated with low risk if you later are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or file name is changed with Con@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; quot ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB large , you must select the two selection boxes , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both function equally as regards the server , but as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer )
numbers at the same time : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored . this can be useful when there is only space on another drive . if the field is not selected , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be left to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files to be enco@@ ded simultaneously : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Qu@@ ad or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each read of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk runs . we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is set up , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; enter data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will indicate the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; output of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet happened , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , please refer to the questions and answers section in the Help section or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album is displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window opens , and you can select the database entry that best fits your opinion to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for automatic retri@@ eving fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for Settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the comment field of the album can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the encoder settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re@@ create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see the help for the enco@@ ders to get more information .
just select an entry that is obviously compatible with the style of the CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the web@@ page of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example can be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you download the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the part list .
note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked in such a way will be read out . a simple click on the line will select the selection of the piece or select the All items selected at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
has been started by clicking the button sel@@ ections of the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on tab orders to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will show you if you try to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether to have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this takes place out and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in case of low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear .
now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; today within the &amp; node ; CVS is supported as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous package from there . most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at people comp@@ iling from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs when it &apos;s running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many options . the best way to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the various map cards of the settings and also includes comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication as it should continue from this sort of empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of program start ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator . whoever wants to add or modify something useful , may do it . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and agrees with this suggestion .
strange if you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these Inform@@ ations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it has real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some properties that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag &amp; drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
session Support . when you finish and play ; while playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Play in the toolbar , select the entry Play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for more pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by holding the middle mouse button and going down and forth with the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template and change the playback speed . to restore the original tempo , double @-@ click on the template LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text acquisition , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces don &apos;t have any lyrics at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so that you do not have to manually set it . so , if you select the Automatic Text option in the Settings menu , the Kara@@ oke text is automatically selected , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify an event type , select the entries text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze . these will be played back in series . this section shows how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection at the point Organ@@ izing .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired one in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not stored . consider this if you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song by button Add . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select The series from the Colle@@ ctions sub@@ menu , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to skip a song , select the button Next song , record next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to skip a song back , select the button Previous piece , add Previous item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not stored when you leave &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General MIDI . in this case , the MIDI map transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano type into the events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet when playing a piano .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all the sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section shows how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the sign of equality is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so don &apos;t change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) that sounds similar to a gun .
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch , where each sound is a different percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound is the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped to a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several Key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussion channel . take a look at the supplied key@@ maps as an example .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . if you want to swap for example the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the N channel . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key map will need to be defined in the file name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will try to change the patch on this channel .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; walking around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played right now .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to indicate the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select View Channel View : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; so that the same MIDI file can perform very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file requires 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without the AW@@ E support compiled . to solve the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
in advance , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the template LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard speed you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have opened on a &amp; k@@ de ; - Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - Windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) , just change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you want to listen to a file only once , without adding them to a collection , turn off the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI Files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , this encourages me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for programming , making MIDI files , making music and proving pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error , or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a lot of joy if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kara@@ oke file from a local group . all those who send me a postcard or MIDI file , I will list with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but you should contact me as soon as I have the file already .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and nobody gets money for it . I would like to emphasize that I am only further programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must &amp; k@@ mid ; comp@@ iling with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course hear no music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the associated entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by directly editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / apps directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you need to select the playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without comparing to the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will consider the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening a different source . this would be annoying at the end animation , so the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite image : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; search &quot; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; / lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; /
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file like setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a flash with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even insert the special em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; to play flash &apos;@@ in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the alignment dialog file As@@ sets of K@@ DE must be specified .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
so that a given back end is always taken for a certain mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manually modi@@ fying the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on will play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog can be used in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected , of which one is selected .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playing of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
at the time of creating this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scann@@ ers , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there advice on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive more silent when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be executed as root after mounting the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is needed to compile &amp; launch .
latex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be taken back to the package &amp; textile ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone regardless of experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , the contact via the box should be made .
if you have any questions or if you would like to compile &amp; play , please contact the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , direct and custom access to all &amp; latex ; in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to learn its capabilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working directly with the reading of the chapter working with the Editor of &amp; Po@@ sters .
for &amp; latex ; is the proper pron@@ unciation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , also a lay@@ ie ( english lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good over@@ sight to &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do it . to be able to master good books e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
as well as other mark@@ up languages include &amp; latex ; an introduction with which the general properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are defined as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ arian , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
quick entry assistant from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some options for creating the document . some can also be made to the document @-@ specific settings .
document classes : this includes the type of document to be created : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ all &#93; , projector &#91; sc@@ r@@ all &#93; , foil &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for and latex ; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source code editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le , it is very prob@@ able that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is noticed by the modest appearance of the output file .
with automatic execution of the environments , a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le will automatically create an empty line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to the command line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu Settings Ki@@ le ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
with the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; latex ; as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; is &#93; created , jumps &amp; Ki@@ le ; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and to printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the check box , the elements of the DVI file are used with the editor and once cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file is j@@ umped to the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; source text is j@@ umped to the corresponding spot in the DVI ; -@@ viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . a master document simpli@@ fies work with others .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set via project project settings .
quick @-@ build : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
view of the file : in this mode , the DVI ; file is de@@ composed , de@@ composed , and there is no call to &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast construction .
when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection fields should be visible . the selection boxes have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is available for spe@@ edy integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ...
the Other is for inser@@ ting items such as tags , notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a name for a section is created , an image or other element .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( choose a selection field to be possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files corresponding editors are necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . die &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Grey is used for the definition of the font . it allows to specify the font size for the main text , the notes , etc . the following fonts are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le ; there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ document@@ .com contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the source code above has to be entered the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or the Quick @-@ Building button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically performs the storage .
if the document fails , it should be searched for errors . if it is not the case , logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { context } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } is possible .
the changes are supervised only within the environment ( \ \ begin @-@ environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , li@@ pos@@ ure , cur@@ sive printing , sub@@ missions etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics pressure and is as long as it is closed until it is closed with \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be represented itali@@ c with \ \ pace { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source code with &amp; latex ; label language has been presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , at least a quote , a few passages in fat and ital@@ ics and a poem should be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor View or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) .
once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps are necessary as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step , after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed using file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; latex ; source text , the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the buttons in the toolbar .
the preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . for this , only Modern can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... tools to be selected .
to execute the preview search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be placed in a row of the source text and then cli@@ cked on to the preview search . the jump to the corresponding spot in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; oc@@ cular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ Document of &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and j@@ umped to the corresponding line . for this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Occ@@ epi@@ ent ; as text editor ( Set@@ ting up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
should there be errors in using the &amp; DVI , an error may occur . if there is an error , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the logging file contains the source code error source . in the editor you can paste the Previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and Next La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between errors . the logging file always gives the line where the error appears . to view the fla@@ wed line , you have to click on the error in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the faulty line .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . further information can be found in the section .
high @-@ quality users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file needs to be opened or a new file is created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings General can be set .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ s.com $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated instructions in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be performed :
when creating a new document , it is possible to select one &apos;s own template instead of the default one .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files created in an easy way to create a template should be searched for on the Internet and searched under the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for the ability of reading and out of many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and its possibilities to learn the manual of K@@ ate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin directly with reading the chapter &apos;s works with the Editor of &amp; Po@@ sters .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be called over the menu La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to choose the &amp; tex ; word . this means that if you click \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip just \ \ par is selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search the most different kinds of source texts and highlight them . for example , the natural latex ; -@@ statements from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can inv@@ ent additional ho@@ ck marks . this is an own type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu entries Edit du@@ ck marks or the respective key signature allow the jump to the next or last diving mark . this is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already outstanding features have been added into &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source text added . &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; -@@ statements and all other lines of the source text . this means that the database is separated by two blank lines .
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also supports &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a return stroke ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , this must first be selected and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; offers the key C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands for a faster possibility . under Edi@@ ting Rem@@ ove the following commands are included in the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to attach the environment .
if the cursor is located before or inside the command \ \ begin { context } , j@@ umped to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , quick overview can be lost . this command closes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups defined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . in the Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
if the cursor is above or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , j@@ umped to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted cur@@ ly groups par@@ enth@@ eses , quick overview can be lost . this command includes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; latex ; two simple suits are used as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hall@@ marks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; for the purpose @-@ bearing implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two simple guiding signs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and for two closing marks for &amp; latex ; one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic entry of the double application characters can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used to specify language specific settings ( e.g. n@@ au@@ di or French ) and thus German or French identi@@ fiers . there are also many other languages available .
if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the \ \ item command .
inside a table environment , close &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close @-@ ending line outline .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added to Settings Ki@@ le ; Set ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to arrange columns in tables -@@ surroundings and all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to make it possible . while using Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the underlying line . although this tab does not have the same , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; add some space for the columns position of the current tabl@@ ature .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offering a good source code completion , this was added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for and latex ; ) are added . three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings Ki@@ le ... Compl@@ et@@ ely terminated .
at the beginning of a new environment using the \ \ begin { context } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { near } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the check button , the last letter of the input will be removed and it is possible to reduce the list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are also removed by selecting a command . alternatively , ropes can be inserted , so that a jump to these positions is possible by means of the Edit jump mark N@@ Ã ¤ ck@@ ste boun@@ cing brand and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; Compl@@ et@@ ely adjustments can be made to these lists . there can be a variety of possible lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ statements as well as wish books of the general language used .
the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of the execution mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of environments .
when calling the execution mode over the menu item Shift + Shift key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the ambient execution can be continued in the simplest way and the input key can be terminated by pressing the Enter key .
once this is complete , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ liste of the termination mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ orders .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; support custom lists of trun@@ c@@ ations that are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Be Compl@@ et@@ ely set up . as an example of a drop @-@ down list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the item L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word execution mode over the menu Edi@@ ting Complete or C@@ trl + Alt Space button is started , the letter L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
big W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many administrators are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written records .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... C@@ lose Compl@@ et@@ ely S@@ uns@@ et . here , the threshold for the display of the execution can also be specified .
the complete files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / dresser / folder per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ lichen home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the Graphics dialog box shapes the integration of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and observed .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and re@@ arrangement of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to examine the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed together in the compilation compilation , creating conversion and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for the viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the key signature Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI file can be converted to a PS file in the default viewer using old ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... here the following information for the project will be asked :
when filling the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function from &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be administered via scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fin@@ ite developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) has the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a fairly designed system where basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tual ; are supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and another natural latex ; -@@ reference .
a full Ref@@ ern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and its â de@@ composed &apos; . it is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete user manual for the &amp; latex ; commands and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents &amp; boxes ; provided documents and this for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the major advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results will be displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface , you generate random signatures or signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out for the whole day . for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; empty signature ; in the signatures section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and add your new signature in the lower section . signature sample Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S File or click the Save Disk icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails at home or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , first select it and then remove in the File Rem@@ ove or click the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the toolbar .
you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short @-@ command , select an action from the list . then click the user @-@ defined action on the right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination .
for the use of &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 is required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all of these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has been familiar with me and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it another piece , let &apos;s give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the desired folder , then leave the current job folder . if not , then remove the selection of current job folders and specify the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous and HTML files will be deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the newly opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book then simply select the current job folder . if not , then select the current job folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then you simply drop the current file . if not , delete the tick on the current file and select the file to be scanned by other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the well @-@ formed check selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ ing check is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in file selection is required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; have already been selected , then simply select the current file . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file selection .
enter the name of the file as the result should have named . normally , the file is stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until somebody builds the t@@ apped in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
to install a plugin or a part , we start editing with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all contained plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to uniquely identify .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears fat after which you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitudes of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for more information on comments .
besides the overview of their team there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Site Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog can create , edit and delete events .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to enter notes is simple . either the note entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with nick@@ name of the nominated nick@@ name of the team member , is part of the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the names are invalid .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with respect to tags , including car completion , can be modified .
big / lower case of tags : big / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
big / lower case of attribute value : big / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , for tags that the closing tag is optional , this is immediately added to the &amp; gt ;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
start and finish day automatically : when enabled , the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using button standard .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file Open Open files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is interrupted by the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies regularly , so that during a power failure or crash the document can be restored from this backup at the next startup of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
previ@@ ewing and docum@@ enting can be displayed either in the editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the default window settings to the default when the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depen@@ dencies of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning messages area is used to control the display of warnings by means of hooks of non @-@ inquiries .
the location for the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ s and the source code view in divided mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep is to be opened automatically during a change in the structure tree . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document .
short@@ cuts are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
this is where the plug@@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are part applications from third side that can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a stand@@ ar@@ there like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Read @-@ Only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only read @-@ only parts usually refuse the load if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then tests &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , then save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; added .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging requests . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that it is not necessary to pay attention .
the counter to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started , the script will start with the requirement .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if a request is given , the execution begins as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where it becomes er@@ ron@@ eous when possible in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that you can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to get better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; you enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; your simplicity and flexibility makes aus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages , and &amp; CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contains two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contains handy , symbolic past@@ es of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , insert text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see details for converting .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of writing errors .
tag folders are nothing but folder . they only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carries the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain anything other than the only element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for tag class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the method method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only happen once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
specifies the source code used to fill out the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that groups the elements of a list together . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a merely element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text within a dialog . this tag can only happen once for each attribute in a dialog ( for example , once for each attribute ; type &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each field ; att &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ atly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replace .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , its simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , verification is only performed when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .

XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = displacement 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . clicking the user defined button can be assigned a key short@@ cut ; with K@@ one , the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the defined settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but there@@ on it is not limited ) , which can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . On this way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script in the following loc@@ alities : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replacing the current document URL . in the case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , process . if only one instance is running , the text unique will be added to the PID number . this is useful when using D@@ CO@@ P for the control of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be used ; in the input field input , it is possible to specify what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard output output . it can be specified , which should be done with the text written to the standard output , by setting the value in the selection box output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the day to the appropriate tool bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them , enable dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available , so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other Program@@ s ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; by default uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; -@@ tag to insert in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , so there are still some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bars setting dialog on Settings toolbar . make sure that the desired toolbar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar might think the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Button is the opposite of the start button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new toolbar must be tested by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all symbols to ensure everything works . &quot; &quot; &quot;
secure in the correct folder . after New XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool bar ( s ) is loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the respective type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might want to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; - Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in &amp; PHP ; documentation like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # with Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , resource files .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that serves to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply and after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that this is good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different places there is an email @-@ send menu entry , such as the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool @-@ like tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scrip@@ ts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the entries are checked and only available if our team needs them as correct and useful for the publication . in order to make a single contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it requires a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the future users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New Resource dialog , the input fields have to be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start up@@ loading by clicking OK .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bars toolbar , and started in the template and Scrip@@ ts tree context menu of files and folders .
after downloading a resource , before installation , investigated &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please read the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Load and Con@@ ver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Definition bar : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are a few key concepts . in order to understand these and to take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first acquain@@ t oneself with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used , available . from tool@@ bars to actions everything is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this enables the group of administrators to secure different toolbar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then are available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that only this user can use them personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ beds the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the Editor window , the tree views , the tabs with information and the toolbar .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all the tabs , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu on the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse @-@ cursor , help the word under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor window , the tool bars of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , for example &amp; lt ; paste ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable to navigate and ro@@ am in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the presentation with tabs are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides . this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website , etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of structuring in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . by clicking with the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or email it .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right clicking an element , a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the content @-@ oriented one @-@ way system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can include project @-@ specific documentation , edit and review .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two tabs at the bottom of the window , can be accessed using the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed .
if you have problems starting with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to occupy themselves with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far along the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; aff@@ ol@@ ding it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and has been quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is not in any way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is provided with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or help k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . each time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest record will be removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look into the section on Tem@@ plates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ Note , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ Note which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script exec@@ utes error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
starting and switching the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries forecasts or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available modes of transportation depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the project managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details .
load a project tool bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be set by means of Settings actions ... can be added . tool@@ bars are stored on toolbar tool@@ bars or you will be asked when you are asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a tool bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , team so that the toolbar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it .
download a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or someone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities are to be fresh@@ ened out of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; without updating the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting using tool bar den@@ ies if this day is contrary to the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above mentioned menu items . click on it . click an activated plug @-@ in and de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the type ; version .
select the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people using other OS platforms for developing . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes take time or cause unpleasant graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode corresponding to the presentation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . with selection of an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
to@@ g@@ gles the status bar display at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
alig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; posters , you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones and modify sequences .
this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but has not yet been implemented .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , for example after completing the project name the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
there is the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adaptation might be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and edit . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently .
be hoo@@ ked when files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started anew from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection of good man@@ di@@ ces .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by hooks or , by removing the hook , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profiles or with the keyboard short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) that are ignored for project related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the Pro@@ files sub @-@ pane , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by trimm@@ ing its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added , changed or deleted . event actions are executed when a particular event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project that was opened .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project or Symbol project open from the toolbar . the dialog Project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , closed , the project file is automatically saved . you are asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... right @-@ click on the right @-@ click context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will disappear to prevent removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by program@@ mers . this option is useful when a frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind prior to up@@ loading .
in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed :
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the project or project toolbar , accessible via settings toolbar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best way to make use of the toolbar toolbar . using and adding differ . adding tool bars is handled at the bottom of the Add Tool@@ bar section .
the toolbar and the icons can be set using context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which new action , a New toolbar can be created , can be used to specify other actions such as tool@@ bars , ren@@ ame tool bars , or set tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog where actions on these or other tool bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will also be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with settings ... and set settings actions .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files for linking . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , basically uses templates like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in such cases the restrictions you present for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
binary is anything that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , i.e. pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be written by any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually more specific documents are placed in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl @-@ base . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve whole Web sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save as local template ....
once that has happened , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template to save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be drawn simply by dra@@ gging and dropping onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project file tree view , then select a site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , the project folder is backed up , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can set he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically work with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as par@@ ental attributes are acquired .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder would be set , it would explicitly activate templates in this path unless they were explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows pre@@ defined or re@@ structured text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be accessed from the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and turn back to source editor if necessary , in which the changes performed in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document containing &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 this mode is activated , the button moves the active cursor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set via settings Qu@@ anta .... By selecting V@@ PL ; -@@ View you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small gap for fast machines and a large span for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , tools can be selected . thus , editing invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor is possible . the document properties dialog is also called upon as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor .
met@@ a tags allow saving information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click into the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating the look of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ eting it by means of a button or removing button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way across the tool@@ bars , as in the source editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars such as the table assistant or the Listen Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for specific elements is possible and the style template design can be tra@@ cked .
around &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to be able to compile successfully , we need the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .

in this command , it is checked for partial or complete agreement with a vag@@ ue named QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested break@@ point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points are re@@ checked again shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

on systems with an installed re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll up / down through the memory of the previously executed commands by using the arrow keys .
several commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a stop is placed in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for comparing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly was changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; indicates the exact differences and is similar to the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can ease the typing work by writing only the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder
the opening dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog re@@ members your selection and displays it next time . you do not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
via the button Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or merging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , but for B and C a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
when merging is enabled , the input field for target is active and can be edited . however , it is not strictly necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the Setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can specify options before starting comparing / merging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the opening dialog you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you &apos;d need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; load them and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can extract nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret dra@@ gging and dropping text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
the information line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these default settings can be changed using the settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you can see the color that differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merging ) .
in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare cases . )
the vertical line that separates the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line breaks is enabled , the line is dotted with dotted lines .
the result window ( among the reference windows ) also has an Info line with the output : , the file name and &#91; Change &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference must also be resolved manually at the same time .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then highlight the current group .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic merging or by manual editing . this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps select another source again . this text will not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and insert elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go cau@@ ti@@ ously with this function .
note : when selecting the sources , ignor@@ ing the numbers or ignor@@ ing Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , up , down , side up , side down , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the add button , you can switch between plug @-@ in and over @-@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows at the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ image upward / C@@ trl @-@ image downward ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict .
to copy the tag to the clip@@ board , press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . there is also the option selection automatically copied . if this is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and eliminating manual copying . be careful with this option , because you may accidentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line thrust utility \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car return + new@@ lines \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not with binary files .
the options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved when loading and restored at the next start . ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you shouldn &apos;t use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c script will be displayed . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors might not be available in their pure form but would be rendered to@@ ast@@ ly . on these systems , the button Pre@@ ferences automatically adjust@@ s an odd color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character will be inserted .
when you press Enter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will also be used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copying to the clip@@ board is then dropped .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer for saving . the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white signs can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart @-@ return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line thrust &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others save only one line feed &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is checked , cart returns are made visible , but as a white sign . during merging , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in the automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is ski@@ pped .
( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and perform a merge . see documentation for directory comparison and merging for details .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting is used for all entries .
there is a short notice about the encoding fields for coding which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you might only want to see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply leave the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison windows next to each other or overl@@ apping . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes you view the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre @-@ processor that matches your needs . for example , you can use this function to cut out disturbing parts or correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is passed to this external command first . if a normal pre@@ processor command has been specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre@@ processor command . the output of the command is only used with the line query . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line synchronization to convert the input to upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword to create $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processing command for line synchronization . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , some details are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and merging . other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ up pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively and merge .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without actually performing them ,
... performs selected actions with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not merging . to start merging , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folders , a small message window informs about current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files that have been compared will be listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan will be shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on + / - or by double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories and open all sub @-@ directories with which you can open or fold up all folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed of problems of this kind again .
as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a file and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a file and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started .
the synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified , and if the option directories are active synchron@@ ize . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action out so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option to select new file instead of merge ( unsure ) is enabled , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date is identical .. As long as such errors are not removed , merging the folders cannot be started .
during merging , a file is processed after the other . it indicates the status column when merging successfully , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . when merging is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
when a file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the resolved conflict column is only shown when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or deb@@ tor ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as target , B is selected as target in the two folder merge B and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that might skip certain entries .
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the list menu or press F@@ 7 ( key short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry , select the action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if by conflic@@ ting file types still invalid merge actions exist , a message appears that points to the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when merging all entries , a dialog box appears with the Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el options .
select Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen without actually making changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( notice the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , choose again the directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to resolve the cause of the problem . if you continue the merging continue ( F@@ 7 key ) , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to choose another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with merging .
if some entries have been merged individually &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , these entries ( in the current session ) will not be combined again . even if the merge action has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered as dealt with . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be re@@ merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified sample are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ format@@ ted files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set folder @-@ specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a previous point sel@@ ects a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting .
when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
for links to Fol@@ der : if the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively brow@@ ses . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not lead to possible recur@@ sions .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) Full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modified date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security .
similar to the date of the modification date . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . this can , for example , be useful when copying the modified date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . the results from merging files are also stored in both folders .
if there are differences , instead of merging , the copy of the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been changed too . you should check it in any case . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it is deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not only the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled in the default setting .
normally , the folder merge view is visible while merging single files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is a corresponding menu entry in the list menu . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . once you save the result , the status will be set to completion and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge .
this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : menu -@@ Menu : re@@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ NO@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relatively und@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished from a link to a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , per@@ missions or change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part , view from the context menu .
normally &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is applied as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
you can click on a patch file in the Kon@@ quer@@ or and select Pre@@ view - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; run as part , it supports only the comparing of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot comp@@ are ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably don &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . see the RE@@ AD@@ ME file for more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will not be treated as identical .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text , no sr@@ c appears ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ use the purpose . please use another editor for that .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need to &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties occur , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift In@@ sert ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replace the current mark .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the update function after changes to these options . )
this also causes identical files to be copied into the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later version of the program ) .
note the buttons to select the source with the A , B and C tab under the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both within a working area and with several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible both within a working area and on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager to set ... and Finish . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries will also appear to minimize , maximize , apply to desktop and exit . the commands make the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , you can move windows within the &amp; C@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas .
if this field is selected , the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager will display the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops .
tick this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed along with name , the names will be provided with order numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is selected , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is selected , the running programs will be shown as small windows in &amp; p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty work@@ spaces are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the order of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the main window can be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as from p@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual working areas in a horizontal and vertical range , which is very well suited for viewing on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view and move the windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
ri@@ ght@@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up switch settings ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator .
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you will need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE key packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; to enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the paper or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for various users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
if you like it , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can create a selected area of the screen in the magni@@ fication window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want the mouse cursor to be displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also works with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press &amp; Shift , push button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will be fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it into other applications later ) , turn the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very small , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , High@@ ly ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , pop@@ up and size &amp; etc ; .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts for a while at the same location . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) Syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that occurs when you click the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , the mere moving of the mouse can cause pain . if you suffer from pain related to your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that occurs when you click with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly .
if the smart move is activated , it makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button emul@@ ates . move now the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . this way you can drag the drag while pressing the mouse button . the intelligent sliding requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be st@@ owed after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool .
if intel@@ li@@ gible shifting is enabled , the shooting field is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be activated . after pressing the mouse button , the mouse button is waiting to release if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function activ@@ ates , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and click the tab General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
when this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other windows environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . if you have already pressed the button Apply , the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of the user .
it is best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first with default settings . in particular , the intelligent move should be turned off at first . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first , you should make yourself aware of which places a mouse @-@ click is without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is ru@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the intelligent move in this case , that means &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to perform a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very easy to mark text , copy it to the clip@@ board and insert any other action you want to move the mouse over pressed mouse button . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead mark text as follows : drop a mouse click at one end of the text area and press the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . as a result , each time you click &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . you know exactly when the moving time begins when moving smart . later you can use the intelligent shift even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window has to be installed . this should already be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse cursor as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and which causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a drag action to start before the mouse button is released . thus , dra@@ gging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can select sentences from a list with the conversation history to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . see the description of the setup dialog for more details .
on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ book . from the text passages , you can often select used text passages without having to type them . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word @-@ crossing . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can reconci@@ le the wor@@ d@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word supplement .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have mouth , you can enter the sentences that you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is app@@ ended to the default memory . you can select from it sentences that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page word completion as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the language output box , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding to pass the text to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text should be passed unchanged as standard input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your voice generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . if this is successful , the other settings will be provided on this page . the t@@ ts@@ d voice service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is reasonable even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text pass@@ code book or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of Instant Mess@@ ages , the selected text passage will be directly spoken and added to the default memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box closing the editing window for text pass@@ book , you can determine whether the text pass@@ book book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text pass@@ book book , the book is saved . if you choose to reject changes , the text pass@@ book book will not be saved . select Before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book book should be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dictionary entries . in the main window next to the entry field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box where this list contains more than one dictionary .
with buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the drop @-@ down box .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the single words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries are summari@@ zed and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass@@ book , you can only change its name .
adding actions like new text passages or books or del@@ eting selected text passages and books can either be accessed through the selection in the menu bar , toolbar , or through a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the sequence of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text will be cut and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected areas of the default memory will be used .
the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default storage .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected sentences of the default memory will be used .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar is located directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the toolbar via the editing window . by clicking on the left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
you probably have not entered the command for the voice output right or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the flash@@ card language output . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )

for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed file , so you need an additional program to cut the text into phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ;
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since setting the voice generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use it as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
for setting , use the side K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can issue text through the computer . a list of already spoken phrases is stored , which the user can always re@@ vo@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer included . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .
for more detailed user documentation , go to help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or launch k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .

in addition to the bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ categ@@ orie list instead . subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ aggregates .
before you can use it , you will need to install speech @-@ schedul@@ er program and set it correctly .
on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the map board is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the map map is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed schedul@@ er otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ ines for the same printer .
if you click on the tab speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the tab card is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet another speaker is set up .
all speakers already established appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not give a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to push the speaker down@@ wards in the list . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the map panel . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost always . go back to the map General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create and manage text jobs . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system by &amp; k@@ de . click on the General tab to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to enable the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the cart@@ on map will be displayed , and you can create text jobs and read the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled to activate voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the Control Panel &apos;s system area , it disappears once the reading is complete .
with buttons in this series , you can start , cancel , pause , and record text orders in this series .
with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the map sheet orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and check the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text to be read before , and select Tools Text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also pre @-@ read .
in &amp; nbsp ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text to be read before , and select Tools Text in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system that noti@@ fies you of events that you specified . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages . you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , set up that you are notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu item Noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ert ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before being sent to speech speech pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation in order to replace spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and or@@ ator , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the speech &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the sustained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of warning .
a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can welcome someone who is entering the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you send from the map card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four orders are processed in queu@@ es except for the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this issue is stopped and terminated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . they are applied to regular warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there are still more types of filters .
drawing boxes replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre@@ defined string replacement filters , which allow the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with voice sel@@ ector filtering , you can send jobs depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the map board for example , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . read about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules after which it is used for voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues to pass the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters created on the page below . processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of standard filters . if a filter is not selected , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs will be displayed below .
you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern for the creation of character chain replacement filters . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the respective replacement text . upper and lower case is not considered when compared .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it just has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries are app@@ ended from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks one of the languages entered here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs are available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if , for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copies .
the string asser@@ tion filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions match an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if agree . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string substitute filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ s word \ \ s . thus words must be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions . if you have the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions you will find in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
XML ; Trans@@ forms Trans@@ forms &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
the speaker sel@@ ector sel@@ ector allows you to send texts to a specific speaker set up on the map board , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; there is a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that specify the program , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it with a click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected , which corresponds best to the desired requirements . click the button on the right to view the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API can be added to the K@@ TT@@ SD language syn@@ thesizer so that &amp; kt@@ ops ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the ken ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ bed@@ d over the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text to read and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type :
open two &amp; con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . first launch kt@@ bed@@ d in a window , then t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my speech ?
I created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re @-@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . you must also do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also , make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or inter@@ pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only mas@@ ti@@ cat@@ fish is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the option character encoding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be corrected by a string substitute filter . see .

the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; dict@@ ts have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package k@@ de@@ but@@ t &amp; kt@@ ts ; then download it . also find the source code of k@@ de@@ bark@@ .@@ ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . also check the website of kt@@ ert ; , for information not yet included in this manual .
speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher uses a customizable module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand and extend the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and compile , you need a current K@@ DE development environment ( Version 3.4 or later ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the speech @-@ schedul@@ er program .
if you have downloaded the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; extract from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ ba or have downloaded any of the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program t@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be further developed so that the creation of speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ chers is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can go back to set or paragraph mode , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application passes text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best suitable speaker will be selected automatically . if you want to know more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in after .
if you click on Add to add a speaker on the map or click Edit , the Poster Set will be displayed . as an example , the set @-@ up of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . details of the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in PAT@@ H is included , you just have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to festival . if voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts , are known , this setting will be made automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you adjust volume , voice speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regulator and display this grey , the voice you choose does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with bigger memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet created a speaker ( or forget to click Apply ) .
if this check box is selected at the start of kt@@ m@@ gr the program window is displayed . otherwise , only the symbol t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is still not running , it will appear in the system area as soon as the K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the map board ator .
with buttons in this row you can go back or forth in the order placed in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other index cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
this is where only text jobs are performed and managed . screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and Mess@@ ages are not displayed . for more information about &amp; kt@@ ops &apos;s message types , please refer to .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled and / or without support for the appropriate audio module ; it cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % corresponds approximately half and 200@@ 1. ; % approximately the double normal speech speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to apply the new settings for the current and / or system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out which device works with you . in case of doubt , choose default .
on this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
News is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that ev@@ okes messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web site , you can welcome to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; insert the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this tab card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; start reading K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the flash@@ card noti@@ fications appear .
select this check box to disable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fying noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played are audi@@ ted by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre @-@ read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sends whenever someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list will be ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected custom text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders here :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the map board .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the All Noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can set the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to select text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as it is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and syntax detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single pro@@ positions . this can begin by syn@@ thes@@ ized the first set , since only the first set does not need to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you see the set limit detection filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of rules identi@@ fier filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add further set identi@@ fier filters , but beginners will get away from it .
the easiest way to learn is to set up the language selection by trying . turn on the sel@@ ector selection and enter text to read . turn on the sel@@ ector selection , change some properties and check how the sel@@ ector sel@@ ector changes . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then proceed faster with the pre @-@ reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a very long time ,
you can pause or cancel assignments on the map card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ us@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything to this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limit recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set boundaries ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text in front of the filter ) . note that the standard set of rules defines the pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ aders .
if you have removed the normal set limit detection filter from default , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in it .
the language sel@@ ector sel@@ ector sel@@ ector allows you to over@@ write the language settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the map board ) . in other words : no speaker characteristics are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of a subscri@@ bed speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is the most likely to match the originally set characteristics .
select the method to enter the desired language features by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select here the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing .
mark this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
as the language is a critical factor in getting the output , it is always treated as the prime property . you will rarely use this property . the only case in which you might want to specify the language is , if you know that a particular application will send text in a different language than that set in the working environment .
to use all the features in the spokesperson range , which is best suited to the following , click the standard speaker sel@@ ector and then use the speaker that is best suited to the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ m@@ gr crashes when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer has crashed and / or has been terminated . you probably need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music at the same time with another application . if I receive a text order , it freezes &amp; t@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating &apos; Un@@ able to open PC@@ M &apos; .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . please refer to the AL@@ SA @-@ project website ( d@@ mix ) on www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but respect@@ ful does not display this voice .
add the new voice to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / vocals . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developer .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program needs to be installed so@@ x and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed themselves on the map board for speaker setup . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) Dis@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t manage websites to be read with a female voice . I set up a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; gt ; read the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . in order for festival to produce no mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file will reject the GEN@@ DER tags for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own character chain replacement filter and now I can go back or forth in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the map tab orders will be shown , the job consists only of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
you are not allowed to filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead use a filter for syntax detection instead .

before using &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you must install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , select the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; produces the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates speech from dic@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival creates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed di@@ phon@@ es. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics di@@ phone .
in this process additional wra@@ pper code will be added to Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which enables management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a standardized integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by matching the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Pre@@ ferences module is loaded if the option Network Set@@ ting in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which best suits the distribution and the rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by selecting the non @-@ re @-@ ask setting the setting can be made permanent . the next start of the network settings will then automatically set this selection .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously all options are shown gray , meaning the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . by clicking the button system management mode , you will get to the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the system management mode provides the full functionality of the module . it is divided into three riders :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the tab network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog box to be edited .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options .
with the Sel@@ ection Automati@@ cally the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are done at the same time with the start of the system services . DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setting is required . either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without dh@@ c@@ p or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address needs to be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching on a switched on network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching off an activated network device can be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
specifies the IP address of the host on the local sub@@ net that con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a host with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS resol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the holder name resolution allows for easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . DNS entries can be re @-@ ordered by selecting an entry or upgrading or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ auf or Her@@ od .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator for name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button ....
the list includes name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list includes some known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this version of IP is still to be replaced in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog .
enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , de Button add multiple times and enter the additional alias names .
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog C@@ alled Computer will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; using rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de does not suff@@ ice ; in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended for experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; configur@@ able configuration files will be discussed .
this area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found widespread use . from IP@@ v@@ 6 it is expected that it is going through in the near future . this description therefore focuses on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg . the network administrator is the contact person to assign a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used .
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not rel@@ a@@ yed on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files created by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is another content in case of active DSL connections to be found there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users with advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change users &apos; schedules .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which additionally offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take to secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be connected to &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; disc@@ ard the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; not the pre @-@ credits on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ credits , it searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been incorporated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be brow@@ sed by folding the entry for the band .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a message in the status bar . the band can now be dropped without any danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a tape drive must be format@@ ted before being used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive requires format@@ ting a tape before use , it must be format@@ ted before using the tape . flo@@ ppy disks usually do not require format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with format@@ ting the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically included and ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
ri@@ ght@@ click the local file tree and select from the View menu ...
once the backup is started , the Settings dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files and change settings for backup .
when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Test ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog will appear for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for verification .
if you have confirmed the check settings , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can initi@@ alize the restore , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
ri@@ ght@@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the menu ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog will display settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the Rest@@ ore dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process and the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the tape index file using the tape content . this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a security profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current job folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the newly elected job folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located in the same file system are backed up , such as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
perform incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; lt ; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to device file for tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is included , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when releasing the inclusion of &amp; k@@ dat , the band is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to change the hardware block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n Byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the band has been format@@ ted .
the Band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be edited directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this icon is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the various options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . if this is not shown , then you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or after entered strings . then enter a string of string into the filter bar . the list of the log lines will now be automatically displayed , so that only a protocol line is displayed , if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included .
you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be compared to the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the process name , and then log in the name of a process in the filter bar , so it shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color than note lines of the level critic . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you want to show only certain processes ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the Process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server .
in addition , you can enable the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new add @-@ in lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu pane to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org . you will find more current information about &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also , in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archiv
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; .
the system V In@@ it quickly develops to the standard for controlling the program starts at boot @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I won &apos;t go into historical aspects here ( among others because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . the &amp; Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start when you boot the system or when you move to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run out something that has to do with the serial port .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default runner level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you will get it repaired by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop .
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is called stop with the argument . if it contains an S , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that lets just ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; running . in addition , I could also have a user @-@ run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or a different pointing device is simple to not tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop it ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by dra@@ gging it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens if you extract an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it by cutting into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ ing , and now the machine re@@ starts constantly . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the Enter key to start in single user mode . then , edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default runner level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; designed for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services in these distri@@ butions are started simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; schedule an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are present which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply exit without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that it can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
once you have made changes , you must save it . either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two tabs , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double @-@ click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings . only when you have activated space constraints ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional flash@@ cards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD uni@@ xes .
the password management card may appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD -@@ Unix .
this card card only appears if for at least one embedded file system limitation ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the limited space restrictions in KB are :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field fil@@ esystem with limited space limitation
the group of cards to which the user belongs , can be found in the field Pri@@ mary group . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works similarly .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , modify operating systems , remove , modify and more .
