<seg id="1">You can translate the module website in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras website. select the source and target language of the translation from the list-up list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the complete & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. Babylonfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations do not make important decisions dependent without checking the translation in advance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only webpages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert texts that can be translated directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; making them easier to use.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual at & konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings Add extensions... Open the box tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default setup modules from the Box; addons. please note that if you have additional software installed, you may need more modules on your system.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click & konqueror; on Extras crashes. then you can view the page that has & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module view filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Manual filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; s current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentaries, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView; is to graphically represent nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree-Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size of a file or folder, the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can display either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labelled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used. furthermore, you can set the relative position of the caption in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For treemaps the rule should be complied with that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always complied with. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of the entries, and this framework will need space, which will then be lost for the frame, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to partition the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here it is always advantageous for labeling and avoiding space losses through boxes to create rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Picture Gallery can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras picture gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you open the image gallery, a dialog opens, with which you can define the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the gallery page in a text input box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a rotating field to set the number of thumbnails in each row in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the check box filename of the image, specify whether the file names are displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the check box file size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file selection Save in HTML file, specify where the HTML page should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "in the" "" "Subfolder" "" "check box, you can set the sub-folders to which level the subfolders will be included." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">With the check box original pictures you can copy whether the original pictures should be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comments file check box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">You can specify a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures in the check box's own color depth.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; Settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media rendition for the navigation pane can be found in & konqueror; Display menu under the navigation pane or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the navigation area of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to listen to the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror; in addition, with which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is useful for web pages that allow access to only certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of & konqueror is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change your browser detection into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password in MSIE for pages that deny access to browsers on the base of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to call with & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module check your & CSS; -Style templates and & HTML; -Documents in accordance with W3C's recommendations and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">You can check the module website in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras website. you can check the following checks:</seg>
<seg id="48">With & HTML; check if your & HTML; -document of the syntax of & HTML; matches, all found bugs will be displayed. with this test, you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to check your & CSS; style sheets embedded in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS, your web pages have a consistent look regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Checks the links on your page to redirects and erroneous links. recursively all links are checked on the website.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you specify the addresses of the servers for checking your & HTML; -documents and & CSS; style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module Web archiving for & konqueror; you can save web pages with text and images in .pdf format.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use it to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can easily be expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or the lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; try to report problems or improvement suggestions as easily as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the help menu contains an entry problems or wishes. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error report system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would encourage you to ask questions to other users of & digikam. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also edit the digikam; visit homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digikam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to log in to the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you want to launch & digikam, start for the first time, you will be asked where to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter path names or click the folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the databnk is stored. this path will remain the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will also use as an albenlibrary.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images, as a base folder. & digikam; consider each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; durst recursively recursively the library path in its entire depth. you cannot exclude subfolders unless it is iste in hidden folder. this can be done by adding a dot in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change those by taking any photo from the album and putting it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can edit and edit your digital camera. after that you should learn how to use My Albums and My Words to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, then & digikam; possibly handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu Help.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh decoder settings and roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, extendible software collection for digital cameras which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails of digiKam. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digikam; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, and digikam; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes were made in & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the side strips with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and dropping images works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the tree tree, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only restriction is that an image cannot be placed in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the filename only works if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos taken by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, sorted by the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties or after the date on which the album was created first.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album Import Pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the pop-up menu you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move it to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right-click on the album and select album properties in the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection from you will be used to sort your photos if you choose to add or delete collections from the toolbar or view albums. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The oldest, average, New Year's buttons: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. for this purpose first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & digikam; open, the first picture in the album will be a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; selected. this should help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another picture as an album icon, you must click the image with the right mouse button and click on the contextual menu & quot; As album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always only be included in a collection and collections cannot be despised.</seg>
<seg id="95">The Album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all the photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be displayed in this album in the image window. each photo will be shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a bit while the preview images are generated. you can avoid this by re-creating all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information this is, you can edit about settings. change the albums page and adjust the range of thumbnails to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse cursor a moment above a picture, the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such an help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about & digikam. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can access all the features that are edited with you. you have the choice between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by choosing either F4 image Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit... Select. in the Edit section, you will find instructions on how to edit your photos. image editing allows you to view and edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the contextual menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File menu. for this, and how to customize it to your needs, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image processing programs, problems with the metadata contained in the image can occur. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the right mouse button to preview and rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 renaming from the context menu. note that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo, it will be moved to the garbage bin of & kde; moved. F8 Image Delete or Del Falls you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumslistequot; organizes your photos based on the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="109">Tags are labels provided by a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also find parts of the tree & quot; My keyword listequot; to collapse so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so, you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword; or click an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked a new keyword, after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be added to the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and selecting keyword edit in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword; change.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another picture as an album icon, you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To use keywords, you first need to add keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword; drag and drop it there. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select cue from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of key words. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to him. in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event in which it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the keywords menu. the menu only shows the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a timately adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame, you only need to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection box that displays the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all the elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps, and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">When you click here, the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the binoculars. if you open this, you can save a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filter what you have entered as search criteria. after saving it, it appears filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be executed. the text box Save Search as is used to list your request a name in My Search list. if you want to change your selection after searching again, you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the form to enter the search will appear again with the search information previously entered. if you select to edit as an extended search, the dialog will appear for the extended search to change your previous search. more information can be found in the section The Advanced Search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are added time-wise, separated by operators. an option can be added to the search group / search group or deleted from it. in addition, you can create searches of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar. if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left side bar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand sketch: draw a quick sketch and digikam; find the right pictures. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or move it out and move it. move it while you press the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a Live Geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a luminaire in a separate window that lets you easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L The illuminated table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window is opened. if you are back in the edit window; main windows are, you can quickly open the light table with L Extras lighting table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select to sync preview from the toolbar and perform zoo and move operations on one of the pictures, then these are also executed with the other image.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to pick up quickly from a series of images. if you navigate pair-wise navigate from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to see it in the right pane. this simplifies it through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal delete actions also work directly from the lighting table, e.g. F4 file Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the lighting table. this makes it easy to associate visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in pivot function, which you recognize on the crossed arrows. to wave the visible area of the image, you have to click it and hold the & LMB; in the mode preview, both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom works as much as in other views. just use the zoom knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom in and out. this is done in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been made to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital stock management. however, most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to secure, find, protect and use photos. we focus on the procedures for Digital Photographers die & digikam; use. we look at the download, rename, remove, convert, group, backup, evaluate, sample, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management takes on, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, assembles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you don't even know how many photos you have, then you probably don't use & digikam;. the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can access freely with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Holiday pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata storage option in & digikam the metadata settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? this provides & digikam; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins as you now should assign keywords, labels and a rating to every photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos in further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's start with keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged pictures from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically set up the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to descriptions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to share your photos, they want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming, associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos the title might be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer, to help Him over the subject that you moved has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8) as caption. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE provides you even a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train of spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are countless and will become deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your trips by means of pictures with geographic data. & digikam; can also export kml files which you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a copyrights with copyright and denotes practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply to all changed versions, thus also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information is in the setup page of & digikam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the job title of the photographer. examples can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a reference to the author's field, it must be filled in as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for vendors): use the provider field to identify who works the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which you provide the image to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they do not provide protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this, in the image embedded metadata. for private persons this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in each image. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate failure, record failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we do not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which cause data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem of CDs / DVDs, these cautious ones must be treated and you may not be trusted for more than a couple of years. of course, you can also purchase CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers on gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece which takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and the checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that seems to work miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn the media with a description, date & author and then store on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Your manufacturer's warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanism of hard drives on this topic: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common fault cause, SMART cannot detect these errors. some of the errors identified by SMART terminate the imminent failure. these are especially reading errors and displacement counter. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric appliances do not make a lot of electric shocks, it looks different with computers with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause persistent keyboards, complete data loss, hardware obsolescence, destroyed motherboards and other defects.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. but remember that not every plug-in strip also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, be sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should be sure that all peripherals that are connected to your system can also be protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage contactors that also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare your security in case of electric disturbances with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the relatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general security solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are provided on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version will provide you more, in case Flickr dramatically more. for $25 a year you get unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disorders remain undetected until you one day to open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection for this in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you'll see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in the alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the loss of data on notebooks and 46% on job systems. notebooks already account for 50% of thefts.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been seen for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file is not completely stored before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorates. a sensor size of 6 megapixel and a high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard disk today for 100 & euro; so do not make anybody else responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by data loss every year. so, do backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before making any more dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. forget airplane disasters: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring up your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that are to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two times: the one of the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time that such a backup has been made. this backup comes with an expansion system closest to the exception that is only scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that have really been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or any other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, image file saved IPTC information, associate XMP files, original memory, scalability, media, recovering images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., usage of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years, that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you must consider all that is said today with caution and reevaluate as time passes. unfortunately, there is no other option as a certain vigilance. all the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this always means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have budgeted the scalability and want to increase the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / sdc & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sdc # modify the size of file if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software to read, then you can create it yourself. this task becomes easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. it should therefore no longer be used.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been designed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (deflate). it manages pictures in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format is adapted by many people.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG is a royalty-free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block quot; technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in raw format. XMP fits this as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it may cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as noted above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI teams, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera panel, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine-grained editing, you can use external programs. if you re-edit the images, you should add the metadata again. these may be truncated from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. first export them into Web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; to get. in the section Add a Photos to an Album you will find a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use & digikam your digital camera, connect it to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. for some cameras it may take a while. if the connection is made, a fertig indicator appears at the bottom and the preview images of all photos on the camera will be displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the view will be shown on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information that is stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata Metadata displays the internal metadata like Exif, manufacturer remark, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the images were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods of & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the download button and then download Selected. the button Selected is grayed until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an Option New is available. if you select this option, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download the buttons All or use Selected, a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section. select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you've selected the target album, press OK, and digikam; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once by deleting the Clear All Delete button. if you just want to delete some, you have to select them first and then use Delete Delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. the photos will not be put into the garbage bin of & kde; they will be completely deleted before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera finder completely, you should do so via the camera system, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are normally recycled after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames if you upload photos from different recording sets to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made to the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for data-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two concern the data about the author in the standard auto-identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you prefer a different date format than the default format, e.g. in the editing field, you can use the prefix photo-% Y% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the option Date & Time. for further customization, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option Camera filenames, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or in uppercase, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which has been digitised; used for a photo, is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section Toolbar, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera does not provide this information, the photo is in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digikam; use this to automatically create sub-albums in the target album when downloading. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar meta data, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in that case, & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. use the Advanced button and select the option Dateline-based underscores at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection is done, digitised, queries & digikam, where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear. select the desired folder and press OK to start uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers can it be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailings and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical allocation (manual) and finally via the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Download the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to store these data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the geographic allocation module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of haisonous coordinates that are created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; try to give you so much control over his workflows as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digikam; change. to access these settings, you must select in the Edit menu; set up. the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set to include preview or start image editing. in order to select the default behavior of & digikam, click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the title bar: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. this may be designations such as photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a more detailed description of the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for vendors: use this field to specify which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture other & quot;. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rims. this means that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited and edited without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image lettering as embedded lettering (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures. note: for images that already contain captions, these are overwritten by the captions.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in a & digikam; album folder that has none of these extensions is digitised; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The brightness of & digikam can be set to the default settings on this page. however, each time you open the lighting table, these settings are turned on if possible. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, you can obtain better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed pictures. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this mode of view can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color formations. please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG is using a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">The TIFF file option compresses the delate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, since the delate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the resolution of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently it is very quickly developed into a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal. if the green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a lattice pattern in the output. this option marks the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 lattice pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera will be used. otherwise, if set, the auto colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white balance is not set. default is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the SLR. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top lights, i.e. the parts of your images that are burned, due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights, as continuous white. use the setting through white in the settings. the setting colors trigger some unusual results, as they can reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the Spitzlichens.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstruction option, you will be able to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adjusted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1. this can also be made later in the image options of the digikam. to keep the time for the demo icing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor, which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenous Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color grading correction since it is carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to give it again. there is also LCMS and digikam; information such as the color information from one color space to translate into the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digikam, then examine these folders during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be stored. everything can be changed later when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, e.g. Canon, which do not contain color tones mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile, which you can emulate how your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated. this could correct you manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for. unfortunately, not on the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension allows you to recognize the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface, & digikam; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these are then passed by & digikam. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the frame transitions, usually 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes turn the metadata into or out, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left hand side a list of all cameras currently supported. on the right side there is a button Automatic Discovery, which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and switch it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will be displayed in the Main Window's Cameras. if you have more than one camera, you can paste them all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving images into the trash bin, you can set and edit the conversation between & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find more details when deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes by the right sidebar can be tacitly supported by & digikam; apply if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any queries. otherwise, you will need to save the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also add & digikam the display of the welcome screen; under certain circumstances, this will speed up the start-up of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Beim Start to search for new photos forces & digikam; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam;. if something is deleted from the base folder, queries & digikam; you if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be in & digikam; used to customize the main window to your taste. you can select these settings in Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam; create, find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selection of the entry / Edit / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam. so you may not be part of your distribution. you can find more information about the KIPI modules in the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before you have used Save or Save the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might need to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this with file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by reproducing from the File Restore or using the Restore button Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done on the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can undo by selecting Edit back or restoring by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should remember the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl, -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; Shift Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press a moment longer via the reverse or restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions between them will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and out in the photo by typing Ctrl, mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the size of the window, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnifying factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you will appear in the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar will be displayed. if you do not want to do this, you can edit it from the Edit menu. see the section for setting the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print image in the File menu and receive the standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences. entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export Wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a side bar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation file, even in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side bar to appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can enter or insert inscriptions with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the inscriptions are copied into the EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">With this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the Urgency IPTC field. coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the key words used previously in this & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to add a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - Date, keyword and search views. if one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop key words. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off under Options Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more, you can easily change it by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, set an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you wish to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I did it mainly and edited it in concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable variance from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes to color management, then everyone wants to know which buttons he wants to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenses are via email or the web, where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and life is so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and thus have to think about color blending?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to list my monitor if I chose to work in a sRGB color space only?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in a sRGB color space or not, you have to list your monitor as sRGB assumes that your; onitor is based on sRGB. if you work as a color space of sRGB, you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Balance, Automatic Balance and Contrast extend from the menu Correcting Automatic Correction try to automatically make the most of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the Leustamp values over the entire image, making the darkest point black and the brightest dot as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the luminous efactor of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. thus, nearly every brightness range has the same number of pixels. sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes either wonders in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic comparison: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channels. it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the entire histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new jiustification of all values in between. this is only visible with well-washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to complete the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The whitewash correction is slightly limited since it works over a color space with 8 bits per color. if you are too far away from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will fail better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it through the menu item colors White Balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right up, a histogram shows that dynamically changes once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even trim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The Overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Download buttons make exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button returns all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the coding depth per color channel of the edited image here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16 bit coding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide to use color profiles can consult the chapter Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and also allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always need the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The color effects are provided by four color effects, a solar thermal effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a channel filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also known as Sabatier, was created by adding a partially developed pressure to a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment eventually creates a negative image so that it cannot be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar heat effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvet is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvias strongly saturated colors are too much for a few photographers, especially those of hardly any landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlight. for large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminance of the photos. you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple dente force / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on toning correction to improve exposure. even though the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the purpose explained here. more details the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three slide slides into which can be clicked and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate is to shift the controls and watch out how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamically updated based on the settings of the image. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top for the dark sounds, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpids can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output rate interactively and the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create an extended picture as background while something else is visible in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and Load: with these buttons, the preset values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input is automatically adjusted for all shadows, resources and Sonnentöne. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input of the histogram for red, green, blue and the Luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images recorded with a digital camera, the linear mode is the most useful. for images with large areas of constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you shift a wedge arrow to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the associated image pixels get darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">When you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a dot on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and Load: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. every curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and solar tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the Luminance Channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the digikam; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color gradations of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">The channel selection box allows you to select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing relative distribution and rash. the left part of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are shown on the right: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance the picture will retain the overall brightness even if you change the appropriate color components. this is particularly convenient if you also activate the option Monochrome, because the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black-and-white conversions of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour space. there are little noise artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The storage and loading buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting can then be saved for later and then loaded. the used file format is the gimbp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was readjusted. maintaining the option Luminance is enabled. the original image can be seen under (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Panf Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulated a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulated a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar light scenes at the time of the day. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulated a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the saddle tones. this is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and redevelopment in a Sepiatoner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) seepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the digikam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry Image texture apply the image processing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or trinity of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed one (2) to be seen. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With & digikam; Add tool frames can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photograph is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the streaming eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. permanently transborders the image with a colored line, Niepce borders it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bent down it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a knop effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any place. this also works in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. the larger the image, the bigger the character set has to be.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." after the image has been saved once, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the digikam; apply mould template you can place a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu can be used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template, simply send an email in English to the & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the Basic Folder button in the dialog. select the folder you have copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After setting the root folder for the templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears. selecting a folder automatically updates the thumbnail preview toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Resize: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you have to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produced especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. in fact, it does not sharpen a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process must merge colors with minimal differences to one color dot. elements that are smaller than the resolution are thus combined into a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for home users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are already using a sharpens image while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening focus. this can be called with the menu entry Conducting Folf.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful, however, since the results do not work very naturally: the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. under refocusing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little softly is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry Conducting softeners and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove mucous from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often generate good results and should first be tried. an increase in the radius or the amount amplify the effect. if you make the blurring mask too strong, you will produce noise and the impression of grates near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should be best sharpened in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount sets the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference sum. thus, one can define a minimum difference in this way for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the sounds are excluded from sharper and therefore beauty flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blur masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurry masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digikam; tool refocusing refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted removal filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. refocusing reaches mostly better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the palate's folding. the Gauss'sche folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also dependent on the source pixies, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauss's Fitting is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should give 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise Filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss. use this parameter if your blur is gauss. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge's focus. however, note that the module will be very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load Buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not visible immediately, but later left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you are reading and compressing images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking used a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masks always have to produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of the blurring. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically the result of the FIR Wiener filter is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the sharpness correction methods in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider puts the blur of the area darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image. whereas larger values mainly smooth homogenous regions and keep details sharp. a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpening is necessary subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value is flattened close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD noise will produce a high value wave-like patterns. JPEG Artefacts are best eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing over alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is difficult to calculate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle Dimensions [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integer step width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal. it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load Buttons make exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artifacts. the module is applied to a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">Die & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hairs on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter needs per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor bugs adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not remove the entire noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the Details Settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the Details Settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammattolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more bolted.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. when it is increased, the edges appear smoother, when it is too high, noise and phase jitter may appear at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">The solution to draw the image a little softly is fortunately much easier than to sharpen a picture. use tool for soft sign with the menu entry Correct soften and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">Die & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artefacts and local mistakes that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefakte reduced: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Download buttons make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can restore like a photo with uniform noise reduction.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected unter (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photo, which was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">Die & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows hot pixels of photos that have been removed with a CCD camera gem. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a darkimage subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the Dark Screen button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then choose the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a spacing of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-quadratic surface (2-dim) or a group of quadratic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture can be seen under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Die & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially the middle and large photo format, can often not evenly illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shading) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the shutter speed under certain circumstances so it is impossible to keep the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should also use a center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unheightened effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the Vignetting Correction Filter and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, reducing the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer re-adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the Edit menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of vignetting correction applied to one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">Die & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens off the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth degree corrects the removed corners opposed to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. negative values can cause distortion and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lentils, the 'Corner Parameters' has the reversed character of the General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image resizes.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The sound or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or resizing changes. best perform this correction as the first. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a tonnular correction the effect is obviously the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the sound / kissed distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the Edit menu from the image processing or the Zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motives such as shots from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tone-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture can be seen under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red movie of the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra movie, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Funge movie grain if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels for the reproduction of infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2) to see. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the sharpeners.</seg>
<seg id="595">Die & digikam; filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film licensing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from daily life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photography, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, then you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film licensing effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the film sensitivity used is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">Die & digikam; Filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">Die & digikam; Filter Oil Painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. flatten the smooth or, from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel big picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">Die & digikam; Filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. images of their gradients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch out. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower knob adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">Die & digikam; Filter Gravur shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">Die & digikam; Filter Gravur is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, equals 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art by distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the shaft blocks 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photograph into a work of art by means of blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurring: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one central point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurred the image by rotating the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographed, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softer blurring: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness sharpness: blurred the image by accidentally shifting the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color-basin in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it through the colt with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">Raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives natural images a wet appearance. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and the density of the drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the Edit & Edit to keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will stay free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. you can find the tools in the menu Transformers Rotation or Transaction mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how to recover the missing information or guess? the Cimg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select Transformers size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use some kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep the aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is present, as it is difficult to calculate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Loading buttons are used for this purpose. each image can be enlarged as text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast with what it does, but it can still last very long and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflating by adding a small picture to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">To cut a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a photo you just have to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut out. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging it at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply holding the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The editing button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or File Save As in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool According to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max. relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool According to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the combination help enable you to fade in, so that you can better compile your pictures. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-angels, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle aligned in similar harmonious triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spirals of a Nautilus mussel or the flower petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; ab, where each number is equal to the sum of its two preceding numbers.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third angel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the spiral line and creates a symmetric visual flow on this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangle is used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also divert from the golden spiral above. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not triangular triangles. diagonal to place these lines can make a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break up your frame create an effect called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options mirroring and mirroring can be used to mirror the harmonious divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easy, that you keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the digikam, image processing and the tool free rotation. select to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are given in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the function Transformers cut out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically Cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the turn. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be recalculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little greased. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments produce a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformer cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. for example, a horizontal shear will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">Move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shearing tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scaling, the image is blurred a bit. for a single shear this effect is mostly negligible, but two shawls are twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing the picture has unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformer cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries compilert have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries, it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system at this point. however, they will always find JPEG and TIFF under it.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; only shows files in formats that you know. this is done by file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, then digikam; modify this list of file extensions. see Configuration section for more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG for the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save losses if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the image format, see Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam; you can find further information on the use of modules with & digikam in the Configuration section.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in & digikam. your description will follow here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softmarks, noise suppression, refocusing, blurring, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you can see & quot; texture applicable; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">The left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally divided without duplicate. the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>

<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this box with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all adjusting entries from the last use of the module will be noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page toolbar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo Characteristics: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data originate from EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or move it out and move it. move it while you press the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. graphics & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there has been no modern & GUI; programs are outdated & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraph viewer; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphics. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraph viewer; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; on. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & Posters; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & bles; the graphene recomputed and in & kgraph viewer; represents)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open or open the graph in & kgraph viewer; in a & kate; - Component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading big graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knot and a hack to represent more than these knots)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further needed software: & kgraph viewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; -Tool & dot; for displaying graphs. required are:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in a separate subwindow. initially, when you start & kgraph viewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only contains the symbol file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; the main window looks like the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by the factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the uploaded file is modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether to reload the graph or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraph viewer; can also note your decision, so that later also proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kgraph viewer; set up... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside a running & kgraph viewer, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraph viewer, or want to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can open all the graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice as well as change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on a page will be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graphene distributed over several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut store page gives the option to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or request the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraph viewer; to specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the start-behavior of & kgraph viewer; you can specify a default behavior (open the files of the last session or not) or choose to be asked for each start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears at a click in the main window with the & RMBs, opens up additional options:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz and layout algorithms. the entries found on the website of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unerived graphs. it produces representations in accordance with the springboard model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springboard model for unerect graphs. it uses the Fruehman-Reingold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes in a circle according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">The command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can & eg; den & graphviz; use special options, or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of the graph (directed or unexecuted) and uses the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for unprocessed graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the Sane project or another source such as video streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry images a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to pick the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears in that you can replace the default default ducroth own to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed because some settings might not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the scanning button you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore very large files created. you also need to select or create the folder & # 160; you must also select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected in the Import &gt; screenshot menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">When all your program windows fade out, the calling program will disappear, so that you can view other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have selected the complete desktop, only the window is read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other work surfaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options already described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to show photos to the people that are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place the photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The exporting module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so, it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started to enable you to login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr web site. the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you get the dialog for uploading photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module exporting to Flickr is started for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog that displays the current access permissions that the module displays. currently, you need write permissions. the module does not currently support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button to add photos should be pressed once you have put all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. click on the Ok button to start uploading the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a comma-separated list of words. these are added to the picture as keywords during the upload.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF data of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same location as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be recalculated with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have trace data from one place for images, you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location is in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog is the coordinates of one call to the next you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the map displayed. select the region in question and increase it. always select this region and increase it. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded by UTF-8 in order to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be customized. the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenpreview and the text displayed in the header of the HTML page will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. the option For each image one page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg.</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLSuite that contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with other color depth. it also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail tab allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will be automatically started at the end to preview the gallery. press closing to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI Viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving on them. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been designed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture will be shown in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows for the actions listed below to save images in JPEG format without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found, for example, in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy from the main program and then invoke the import function. this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported when writing.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiver module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG encoders can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Slideshow. after that you can create the module via Tools MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed among image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the list of images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to return the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the mpeg output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. once you have adapted all settings to your preferences, you can use the encoding button to start generating the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can quickly or in all rest enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the button Settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is for example: useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct printout.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename stays the same, and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless capability of LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them further, you should not choose the JPEG format, as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion using the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are secure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to override existing files automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all the images of an album. you can set the prefix, the number of numbers and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images in an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: non-proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for the photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo apiece. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the pictures window will be displayed with the images you selected. you can add more images using a file selection dialog using the button Add images. for the last selected image, a preview will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop pictures to the picture list and add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Remove images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your email client. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't mind to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations to the size of emails sent. it might be a good idea to send multiple emails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted from lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG images in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is completed, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you would like to have shown your slide show will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-Transitions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name option shows that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time interval between the images can be set with delay between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test it before you show your friends to the presentation!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly select another effect at any transition between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name, location of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation at present. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting an image as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of submenu, as background for your KDE desktop surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your pictures and videos with comments, you can browse through & photoalbum; through these browses, see picture. as you can see by comparison with the image, now in each group, i.e. in people, places and in group keywords entries are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have provided information when you have marked your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse with the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images are shown, on which both persons are to be seen. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save your own thumbnail with & kphotoalbum; this is of course also valid for locations, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture below.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view pictures next to the names, select the button on the right of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can view symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide which image is to be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you will need to open the image view window (described in more detail) and select the image for the respective person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you open the search entry in the main window, a dialog will show you that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can preview this dialog at once.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the label or description field, the captions and descriptions of the images will search for that text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can either be part of the total date, e.g. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can search all images by certain names as you can see in the picture. here is shown by pictures depicting Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals, but rather want to try out the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & photoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photoalbum; and select in the first dialogue the demo if you & photoalbum; for the first time start, or select from the menu Help menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then, some sample pictures will be loaded and you can try the features of & photoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print out this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & photoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & photoalbum; view the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you data statistics on the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be interactively used in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview window) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by holding the mouse button down and moving the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timestamps. if you select an area, you will only see images of this time period in preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& photoalbum; provides two possibilities to create HTML web pages with your images. one is integrated into & photoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & photoalbum is described; integrated version that can be created through the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the survivor and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & chphotoalbum; export file will be created which is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, all images are from a party.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, which is why it is not dealt with specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. thus, those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no longer download images that have for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set. so, you can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if he wants to get a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to select a basic folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they really are all visible to the viewer. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to copy them manually. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all the subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings currently described have related all three to basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name will set you in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbum; come together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & photoalbum; this work will not do again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kin file directly from the Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images twice. first, it searches the images that are in the file of the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images can be viewed, which you can access through the Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the option Manual to copy to the .kim file, you must copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy the .kim file copy & photoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. because most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import... menu, & chPhotoAlbum will import and import the exported database as described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personer the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window you will be asked which categories of the file to import are to be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to import with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups. if you look for example pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will pass through the various steps of (1) Setting the information about your images, through (2) searching and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and adaptation possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it will take care of your videos. in many places in this manual there is talk about images, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photoalbum; records all its information in the file index.xml in the uppermost folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photoalbum; records the folder where your images are stored and uses it automatically in future starts. if you want to read another database in & photoalbum, so you can launch a different folder tree with images, you can launch & photoalbum; as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of & photoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, the various settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. a detailed help is available for each setting, which can be called by pressing a button on the F1 key and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories have already been mentioned in the section. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete groups of members, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, rather than all groups of a member as explained in the Options dialog.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photoalbum; shares its module system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">Modules can and will not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access through the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Because the modules are shared by multiple applications together, it may be that the modules were tested with & photoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures. demo database can either be accessed through the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, making it possible for some modules to work with & kphotoalbum; this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications put their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & photoalbum; this type of order does not support, it simulates order by albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulated & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & photoalbum has to be released; the modules also have a list of albums.</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a Category for Virtual Albums. so, for example, if you use the category People, it will be & kphotoalbum; so do so if you have selected people to view and pass on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select which modules to load.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you & photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see a menu and toolbar at the top. at the moment, you do not have a lot of information, since you do not yet have any information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & photoalbum; is the ability to display any picture with notes. this includes information about the people shown on the picture, where the image has been recorded, etc. you can use each image individually or for a larger number of images simultaneously. if, for example, shown on all pictures Jesper and all images were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text field by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & photoalbum; as you will always use them when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, you can, so that the names used are moved up, find the people faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sort by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add comments to them. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons that are under the preview of the picture on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple Inventory at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you will see a browser window that displays the USA as a supergroup. to show you that it is a group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the comment dialog's context menu, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can simply drag one entry into one category and place it in order to sort it in an subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a box by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... which gives you the possibility to save the current layout and look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also fade out a frame completely. if you want to see this window later again, use the button Options... and then hide / hide windows. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected pictures, or all images if you do not have a filter. an example for this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be displayed in the image viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview preview. simply select the images you would like to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit Selection menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photoalbum; offers a solution for this problem. you can use & kphotoalbum; you can also use the images somewhere, so that & photoalbum; you can record the images somewhere, so that & photoalbum; you can be loaded into the database index. in the picture you can see the view of & photoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is truncated, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the images 5-9, the preview images are present, so & kphotoalbum; you can preview these images, but you can not view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back. & kphotoalbum; does not support you until now to avoid inserting the respective CD. so if you want to avoid trouble, how to avoid messing up your images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Image menu you will find a sub-menu with the name Privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those remain that you want to make for others inaccessible and click on Current View in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister may see, and select the menu entry Anything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This means that you specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give your little sister the laptop, simply select the menu item images, so all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the images displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be typed to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select Password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images are on the hard disk and on the other hand anyone who can access the index.xml file can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are with & photoalbum; not very familiar to forbid the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & photoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is of course that you want to consider them sometime. for this reason & photoalbum; over a picture and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in it. of course, it shows the image, but additional all the information you have in the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can drag and drop them somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is to be displayed at all.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser, see the matching entries for this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can let them run as slide show. & photoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it is able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can move in the image and zoom out. to zoom in, you can simply move a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button, you can zoom out again. the Plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of zooming.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not shown zooming. the same button sets the zooms, so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that are in and out zooming with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the twist functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the image. at the moment you can view the view and open configuration dialog of the image to enter these names. however, you might prefer to select only the image and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to display images with features while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in view a picture with which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have identified features on your images, these are available in your browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just add them all at once with notes. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview view. if you want to view categories in dre Preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you are allowed & photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your gemold later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to see the painting mode of & photoalbum; switch on the painting from the context menu. to end the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you must use the application of the program & Povray; not fully rule, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu Insert.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed for you to choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>

<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the whole texture is rendered even if you want to render only a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross the box locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wiremodel view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the level of view of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility stage selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& szpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window arrangement, or if you need another arrangement, you can set it as desired. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a given view, pull the start to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle then indicates the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the start to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views of each other, drag the start right into the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the card icon at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view out of the anchorage, drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the chamfer bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamois bar. to prevent closing, click the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with view window arrangement... Save. a dialog appears, in which you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on the Rendering icon The symbol Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene render.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different frame sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render Modi in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each ring mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it's a name that makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map file size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel, various errors can arise. these images often have a Moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-Aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is supersampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the second method is adaptive, non-recursive; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is further divided and adaptively because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the predefined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels that are tracked individually and tested for further subdivisions.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to create noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, changed & Povray; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last adjustment for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; that calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a very long time to let a scene calculate with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card you can choose whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is transparent then if the associated rays have not hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & chpovmodeler; not yet the complete command scope of & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, open & chpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document retention and version here. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) into the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene folder, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wiremodel views. you can set the grid separately for displacements, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross High details for enhanced projections, all wiremodel views are further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross the wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a bottom is rendered under the objects. the bottom is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When activating edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more details on the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window instructions section explains how you can create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector standard window arrangement: shows all existing window orders. & chpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created using the Add button and deleting a selected order with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created by button Add and Delete selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The new column. with new column, create a new column on the right of the existing windows, with unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with tabs you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and floating anchoring the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & Chipovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & chpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols as well as their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit Delete menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireframe view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right down). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or the Enter key, the wireframe views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings. as a result, you see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert Endor Body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& Chipovmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite layer as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree, the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wireframe view now also shows the level, if at the moment only as a finite finite level. when you render the scene, the level extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case you will only find the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are a lot of different materials, but select something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens, in which you can select how the object should be inserted. please select the first subproperty. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button Preview see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment shows only a matte black material, because you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on Preview. now, enter the colors for the pigment. also, there are many possibilities again, but take the simplest one.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the quader and ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then click on the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select monochrome each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to do this step simply because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easily as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the Enter key or the button Apply), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the floor, as you have shifted the floor by one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering is now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first subproperty and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click on orb Pigment, then select one-color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness-effect and reflection settings result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces even when metal is not selected yet:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered by you and kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file you created previously with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">Once you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last undo command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit back.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window arrangement and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & chpovmodeler; here you can change the look, key shortcuts and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to modify or add new short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models will then be further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& Circulation Show; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & cow show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the & LMBs or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file type, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a suitable file name is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the Configuration - & Circulation Show; there are five flashcards. in three of them, general and editing and slideshow, you can adjust the mode of operation of & cow show; in the two other, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the shortcuts for the respective windows can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down. default is not fullscreen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Is this point activated, loads & cow show; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay when you choose the next image and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>

<seg id="1181">& Amarok; used like all other programs shortcuts. below you will find a list of these shortcuts and their function. the global shortcut can be set up by right-clicking in the player window and setting up global shortcuts. you can set up the key shortcut by right-clicking in the player window and selecting short commands...</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as & Amarok; short commands. this makes your keyboard a & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many common functions, most of which can be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlists browsers and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP function break & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialog so that the user knows why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' Rescue error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most of the scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notification to all running scripts. to do this, strings are written to the default scripts. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Wide the script to display the setup dialog. to store and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is played. the script could now query more information about the new piece using DCOP functions (e.g. metadata or piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume indicates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a custom menu item has been clicked. submenu and itemTitle are also passed so that the script can be used to remove the selected item. to remove an entry, you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; ends, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed to do such as clearing up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar Archives (.tar) which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as myskript.amarokscript.tar.bz2, so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation catoscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can add it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki script side of & Amarok. for your entry on kde-apps, you should use the Amarok category; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde; & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you just want to find a very specific title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">You may have already some playlists, but you can never decide which one you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just right for you. and if the decision is still difficult, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. furthermore, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually, in the base folder of the Amarok sources, you need to enter the following to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake used, you should have no difficulties when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable the compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compile options, certain dependencies must be fulfilled in order for them to be used. details can be found in the System Requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the various functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">If the option is turned off, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1212">Create atmospherically: this function is only available when & Amarok; compiled with support for moodsbar. this will change the color scheme used for the tuning barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Disclaimer files in the music files: this feature is only available when & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. if this setting is enabled, .mood files will be stored at the location of the appropriate music files. otherwise, .mood files will be stored in & Amarok's preferences folder (normally ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External Browser: lets you choose which browser from & Amarok; to start when a browser is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save the playlist when you exit, save the current playlist automatically when you exit & Amarok. enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist when you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1218">To keep up-to-date piece when changing the piece, causes the playlist window to roll up / down to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing the context browser automatically shows the context browser when the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & Amarok; s Appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section you can specify the use of different fonts in & Amarok. by selecting proprietary fonts, the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, player windows and context browser. press Select..., so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the Selection Custom color scheme, you own the Qual of choice and can designate your own color scheme. to do this, use the color selector activated for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Continuing playback at the start causes & Amarok; after program start, the play continues automatically with the piece on the spot, with which it was stopped at the last ending.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is attached, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can directly view the effect of all settings in this preview.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be shadowed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD colors for font and background. one click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if your own colors are not enabled, the preset & kde; colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The option screen is intended for Xinama users. this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The box audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still enable additional adjustment options in this tab card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection, including the folders and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; Browse to music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes to set up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Recursively search subfolders: this causes & Amarok to browse both the selected and their subfolders according to music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). furthermore, incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: make sure & Amarok; add all found playlists to your collection in your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will then appear in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further installation in the MySql subwindow is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql device section is used to set up the database for & Amarok. on Calculator: will the host enter where the MySql database is located. then it is entered under Port: the network port under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Enter user name: and password: to enter the data required for the connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The debit card last.fm establishes support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if required.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and update the profile: this setting makes it possible & Amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">You can access the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of it to find e.g. modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD require that your window manager does the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example, but fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by deleting ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org and also append the file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">This is mostly due to the fact that taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a little more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatic switch off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens when crashing). if this is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta info, but do not label it as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error while writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\" unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script needs the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be reinstated with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e'install MP3:: Mplib '</seg>
<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten. in some cases, you need to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined icon: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. you can see this with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most of the installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also help other users or developers. use the forum and IRC at irc.freenode.com in the channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please bear in there only one mistake, if there is something in the repair of a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok, just a blank playlist will appear. how do music pieces enter in?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the interface intuitive, the Start subwindow has been converted to the Statistics window. you can find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars represent the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the valuation column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show rating. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard. or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the playlist from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop it there, just as you would make it with other files. so easy is that: -)</seg>

<seg id="1269">No! yes, that's really true! no! & Amarok; uses a back-end independent approach, so the real question must be Which media types supports GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you see, we support almost every imaginable audio format.</seg>
<seg id="1270">It can! maybe use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, which does not include MP3 decoders in the default setting (for patent reasons). the solution: Alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 kde, input key</seg>
<seg id="1271">Launch the YaST Online Update and install the Multimedia Option Pack 1. so... & Amarok; plays MP3's off: -)</seg>
<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware blender (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for alsa (Software-Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in the search for the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you might need to specify a different sink (e.g. ossink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Do not forget that media must first be decoded. you can not just send a MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, as well as xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center Sound & Multimedia Sound system. enable sound server with highest possible priority (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">At KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this bug report. to enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts Driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been greatly optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok; from. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all components. follow the register register to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (quit Amarok before!): - download, compile and install ffmpeg, once as a system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with the latest-config / GStreamer-config) and execute the list register again. start & Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a runtime display showing the currently running piece or the current stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time to the remaining time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also under the running text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of playing buttons, volume control and the play position slider. use the sliders to adjust the piece position or volume. with playing buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from Klassik to Techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you activate the check box equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & Amarok; is the most developed playlist for all available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the fullness of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation pane. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current part. its appearance can be adapted using context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the underwindow has been discarded. the information shown there are now available in other parts of & Amarok; in addition, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to follow the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png will be supported. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended Pies, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played right away.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the suggested pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter. this section displays the five highest-rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set what information should be displayed in the music subwindow. to do this, right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, the artist's albums, lists all the albums of the current interpreter that you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be folded up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the underwindow text, the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the running piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. once you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be stored in & Amarok; s collection database.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - groups only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres will be disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">If you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Artist / Year - Album - Sort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year for an album is unknown, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically and are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will be shown first by genre and among them sorted by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection once you change anything to the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter there is a selection box, with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose from different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours to a year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This cleaves the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to Playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect.</seg>

<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes it easy to use many playlists. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Smart playlists are possible. click on Smart Playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser you will find an address bar with which you can obtain music from a given URL. if you enter, for example, tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press Enter, you can listen to music in the musi.tar.gz file. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window space, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping the shift key. in this case, holding the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all the pieces you want to play. you can change the order by simply moving the entries with the mouse to the desired location. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter delimited search terms by whitespace, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter between the search terms OR, search for entries that either contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR Two OR 3. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof) will be found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then enclose the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that include Mike Oldfield, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a certain search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a certain search term, set a minus sign before the search term: -something searches for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">For example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50-comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding the Ctrl key, and then right-click in the desired order to the entries. the entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>

CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info, locking and unlocking the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Content View allows you to select and drag files to the project view. the Content View is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key assignment below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct authorizations for burning CDs and DVDs. for this purpose, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general application settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work right away. this dialog is intended for personalizing and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; -applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In order to use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of task is crucial, which of the programs you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line. to use the & DCOP functions, you must make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; program have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyist, formatted DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createDataCD Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVD DProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () void copyrighd () void _ void () void burncdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be used for data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString parent) void addUrls (QString path) void renameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString NewName) void setVolumeID (QString path)</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill in a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCD Project) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioCreator; is an audio CD; output reader for & kde; with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are also possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in WAV files on hard disk) and many encoders that encode these WAV files. currently lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default. more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the tracks of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or also in other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself. however, only the encoders need to be installed that are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the Welcher Kodierer chapter provides a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device protects the protection, it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD; in any case it can & kaudioCreator. avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling for the reading of a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Converting to many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the step by step for example, there are more information on how this program is used and screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - when a encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dalog - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. it should be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager so that an already selected file will be selected to encode instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as logs, piepses) for program events (like reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main setup dialog by & kaudioCreator; with different flashcards (like encoder, for setting up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is required. in addition to FLAC, there are also other such as' greek 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play back these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate the differences are less important since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is supplied free of charge with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (with high bitrates) but lower bitrates compared to OGG.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or fetched through the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / used with & kaudioCreator; and the encoder program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; titles to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudioCreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter the information, so that all the others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of translator: with this the author is meant) am not a lawyer. however, nobody can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; is actively selecting a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with a different (fake) address than the one installed in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioCreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What selection program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more about it, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note is that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoders and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoders package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders. more information about encoders is in the Welcher Kodierer chapter.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, you can get more information about its switch by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read real to it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure of what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg; trying to copy something inside with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each read-out & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to be used to compression the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change it at any time you read a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD / DVD drive is present, the effective device name can also be specified. if you can access the drive with other programs, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The General Settings tab. here is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information please select, so that you will be informed when data for creating keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically downloaded from a freedb computer via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: while reading the & CD, the computer must be connected to the Internet to access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, becomes a & CD; entry found, starts immediately reading the & CD;. that is associated with low risk if you later are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or file name is changed with Conqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & quot; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb is not used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before. however, this is over 620 MB large, you must select the two selection boxes, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equally as regards the server, but as many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp folder exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Numbers at the same time: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? paralleles reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored. this can be useful when there is only space on another drive. if the field is not selected, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be left to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression ratio is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id 3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'Tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files to be encoded simultaneously: with a Dualcore or Quad or even a multi-processor machine, you can try to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each read of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk runs. we will create and set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is set up, as we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read-out & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from those for a & CD; with successfully fetched data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; enter data manually instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example. it's a 'special' output of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet happened, then the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, please refer to the questions and answers section in the Help section or go back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; there is a window opens, and you can select the database entry that best fits your opinion to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic retrieving freedb (on page & CD; settings in dialog for Settings), you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but get the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"" "e 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first" "" "piece" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Current Title' unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field of the album can be used for individual comments, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudioCreator; maximum allowed. this option is set on the encoder settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see the help for the encoders to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select an entry that is obviously compatible with the style of the CD; in this example, this is not important because we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the webpage of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example can be found under Rock.</seg>

<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a handbook to & kaudioCreator. whoever wants to add or modify something useful, may do it. at least after the contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and agrees with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you've managed to get the source file from & kde; SVN, then you don't need these Informations, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke player from & kde; besides others, it has real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts also some properties that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support. & kmid; also supports & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the song text on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphic representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can drag & drop any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session Support. when you finish and play; while playing a song, kmid starts again with the same song again next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -Window to the & kmid; windows drop. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button Play in the toolbar, select the entry Play from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (for more pieces, they are added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by holding the middle mouse button and going down and forth with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template and change the playback speed. to restore the original tempo, double-click on the template LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text acquisition, others use lyrics and other both. some pieces don't have any lyrics at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which a song is used, so that you do not have to manually set it. so, if you select the Automatic Text option in the Settings menu, the Karaoke text is automatically selected, but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the entries text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these will be played back in series. this section shows how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection at the point Organizing.... Click there on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired one in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not stored. consider this if you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song by button Add. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and emptied.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select The series from the Collections submenu, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the button Next song, record next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To skip a song back, select the button Previous piece, add Previous item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not stored when you leave & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General MIDI. in this case, the MIDI map translates General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano type into the events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always sound a trumpet when playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all the sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section shows how General MIDI patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign of equality is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so don't change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard for example does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with Ton 60) that sounds similar to a gun.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch, where each sound is a different percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound is the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped to a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of the lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several Keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussion channel. take a look at the supplied keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. if you want to swap for example the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the N channel. if you use the Keymap option, the key map will need to be defined in the file name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will try to change the patch on this channel.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBender Ratio indicates in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch Bender event with the value 4096, should play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; walking around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played right now.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to indicate the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select View Channel View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">So if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc; so that the same MIDI file can perform very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file requires 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without the AWE support compiled. to solve the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the template LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard speed you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have opened on a & kde; - Desktop a & konqueror; - Windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file), just change to the & konqueror; -windows and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only once, without adding them to a collection, turn off the setting Automatically add to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI Files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, this encourages me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & AntonioLarrosa.Jimenez; Malaga (Spain). I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time for programming, making MIDI files, making music and proving propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error, or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a lot of joy if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. all those who send me a postcard or MIDI file, I will list with friends of & kmid; but you should contact me as soon as I have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my spare time and nobody gets money for it. I would like to emphasize that I am only further programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">I would like to thank Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the CIS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error notification or just a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the web, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid; also found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must & kmid; compiling with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course hear no music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, please contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or phonon formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you click an entry, his group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by directly editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / apps directory can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select the playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without comparing to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will consider the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening a different source. this would be annoying at the end animation, so the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the display of a favorite image: & lt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; img dur = "search" / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet; / lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; /</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the Configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file like setting up the backend via mimetype. here is an example like a flash with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">"" "" "" "flash" "" "can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even insert the special embed for YouTube in the playlist XML." ""</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer; to play flash'in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the application / x-shockwave-flash in the alignment dialog file Assets of KDE must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that a given back end is always taken for a certain mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manually modifying the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon will play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either via MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be stowed, the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog can be used in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected, of which one is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playing of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also only supported on the first screen (: 0.0). therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>

<seg id="1731">Is there advice on how to make my CDROM drive more silent when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom is to be executed as root after mounting the device. it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / cdrom is shown on the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - as well as other source code editors - highlighting the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile, it is very probable that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, it is noticed by the modest appearance of the output file.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic execution of the environments, a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & Kile will automatically create an empty line (for entering the text) and the corresponding line to the command line (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set up in the menu Settings Kile; LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">With the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when creating your own & latex; as soon as a DVI; file [is] created, jumps & Kile; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output type of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and to printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the check box, the elements of the DVI file are used with the editor and once clicked on an element in the DVI; file is jumped to the corresponding section in the & latex; source text is jumped to the corresponding spot in the DVI; -viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. a master document simplifies work with others .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set via project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick-build: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">View of the file: in this mode, the DVI; file is decomposed, decomposed, and there is no call to & eyepiece; after the fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection fields should be visible. the selection boxes have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection box is available for speedy integration of the document into parts, chapters, sections,...</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for inserting items such as tags, notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section is created, an image or other element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (choose a selection field to be possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for the editing of & bibtex; files corresponding editors are necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. die & bibtex; files can also be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name Grey is used for the definition of the font. it allows to specify the font size for the main text, the notes, etc. the following fonts are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile; there are two choices available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ document.com contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has to be entered the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s Building or the Quick-Building button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; automatically performs the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document fails, it should be searched for errors. if it is not the case, logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {context},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} is possible.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are supervised only within the environment (\\ begin-environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, liposure, cursive printing, submissions etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics pressure and is as long as it is closed until it is closed with\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in one set can be represented italic with\\ pace {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code with & latex; label language has been presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. to do this, at least a quote, a few passages in fat and italics and a poem should be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file is created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps are necessary as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step, after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed using file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source text, the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a suitable setting for all & latex; -Binding files. for this, only Modern can be set up under Settings Kile... tools to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To execute the preview search, the mouse pointer must be placed in a row of the source text and then clicked on to the preview search. the jump to the corresponding spot in DVI; -viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & occular; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -Document of & Kile; open and jumped to the corresponding line. for this, & Kile; in & Occepient; as text editor (Setting up the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should there be errors in using the & DVI, an error may occur. if there is an error, this will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file contains the source code error source. in the editor you can paste the Previous LaTeX errors and Next LaTeX errors for jumps between errors. the logging file always gives the line where the error appears. to view the flawed line, you have to click on the error in the logging and & Kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">High-quality users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file needs to be opened or a new file is created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using a file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... Settings General can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documents.com $$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated instructions in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be performed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, it is possible to select one's own template instead of the default one.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created in an easy way to create a template should be searched for on the Internet and searched under the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for the ability of reading and out of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & posters; and its possibilities to learn the manual of Kate should be used. users of & Kile; can begin directly with reading the chapter's works with the Editor of & Posters.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very convenient & latex; command reference, which can be called over the menu LaTeX Reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to choose the & tex; word. this means that if you click\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip just\\ par is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search the most different kinds of source texts and highlight them. for example, the natural latex; -statements from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can invent additional hock marks. this is an own type of bookmark within the text. the menu entries Edit duck marks or the respective key signature allow the jump to the next or last diving mark. this is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; although & Posters; already outstanding features have been added into & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source text added. & Kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; -statements and all other lines of the source text. this means that the database is separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also supports & latex; -commands with a return stroke (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, this must first be selected and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Posters; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; offers with its own commands for a faster possibility. under Editing Remove the following commands are included in the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore & Kile; for more commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command jumps to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command jumps to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to attach the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or inside the command\\ begin {context}, jumped to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, quick overview can be lost. this command closes the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups defined by parentheses {...}. in the Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumps to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command jumps to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is above or behind the curly bracket of a & tex; -group #, jumped to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested curly groups parentheses, quick overview can be lost. this command includes the recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">"" "in & latex; two simple suits are used as" "" "hallmarks" "". "for the purpose-bearing implementation is used in & Kile; the sign" "" "for two simple guiding signs." "" "& Kile; knows this case and for two closing marks for & latex; one." ""</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double application characters can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used to specify language specific settings (e.g. naudi or French) and thus German or French identifiers. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">If the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break but also the\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Inside a table environment, close & Kile; the current line with\\\\ with a close-ending line outline.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be added to Settings Kile; Set... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange columns in tables -surroundings and all Et signs (amp;) among each other. & Kile; tries to make it possible. while using Shift; Alt; amp; search & Kile; after the next tab in the underlying line. although this tab does not have the same, add & Kile; add some space for the columns position of the current tablature.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Posters; already offering a good source code completion, this was added to & Kile; for special commands (mostly for and latex;) are added. three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings Kile... Completely terminated.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning of a new environment using the\\ begin {context}, & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {near} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the check button, the last letter of the input will be removed and it is possible to reduce the list. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are also removed by selecting a command. alternatively, ropes can be inserted, so that a jump to these positions is possible by means of the Edit jump mark NÃ ¤ckste bouncing brand and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; Set up... Kile; Completely adjustments can be made to these lists. there can be a variety of possible lists for & tex; - and & latex; -statements as well as wish books of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the execution of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call of the execution mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the execution mode over the menu item Shift + Shift key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears\\ begin. after that, the ambient execution can be continued in the simplest way and the input key can be terminated by pressing the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is complete, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile; recognize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; Set up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the WÃ ¶ rterliste of the termination mode for & tex; - and & latex; -orders.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; support custom lists of truncations that are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Be Completely set up. as an example of a drop-down list, the file example.cwl, in which, for example, the item L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word execution mode over the menu Editing Complete or Ctrl + Alt Space button is started, the letter L will be replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Big WÃ ¶ rters are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many administrators are written more than once in a document. thus, & Kile; the completion for all already written records.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings box... Close Completely Sunset. here, the threshold for the display of the execution can also be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / dresser / folder persÃ ¶ nlichen home folder. mode stands for abbreviation (abbreviation), Dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog box shapes the integration of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of the graphics formats, the sections should be considered and observed.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files, but provide an excellent basis for changes and rearrangement of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to examine the result of the work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are grouped together in the compilation compilation, creating conversion and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for the viewer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the key signature Alt; 2. after that, the DVI file can be converted to a PS file in the default viewer using old; 4 the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file and be viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the quick-build command, a viewer is normally called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will open each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be asked about the project New Project.... here the following information for the project will be asked:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When filling the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function from & Kile; allows the execution of ECMAScript code. scripts can be administered via scripts in vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet finite developed and can be changed in other versions of & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & Kile; a system-wide object (= box) has the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a fairly designed system where basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & Kile; offers a lot of different aids to support users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & textual; are supplied with many documents. included are a documentation for the included packages and another natural latex; -reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">A full Refernz for & tex; and its â decomposed '. it is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a complete user manual for the & latex; commands and is thus ideal for searching for a specific formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into & Kile; in three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / textual; delivered, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help offers & tetex; / textual; the small application texdoctk, which contains a database with all documents & boxes; provided documents and this for a graphical surface area.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the major advantage is the search for package names or keywords. from & Kile; only the results will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">A double-click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& Kile; is a quelloffener and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; source code editor for different architectures of & Linux; - and Unix-like systems available. & Kile; is also part of the Fink project, which makes & Kile; also available on & Mac; with installed OS X.</seg>

<seg id="1916">The version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration into & quantaplus. all of these tools use commanders as surface and libxml2 and libxslt as a base. the combination yields fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Anyone who has worked with the & kde; documentation has been familiar with me and how outstanding it is. let's take it another piece, let's give it a graphical interface! no longer dependent on a terminal; simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished!</seg>

<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous and HTML files will be deleted every time myproc is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As already said, everyone who has worked at the & kde; documentation has already worked, knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus, there is now a great graphical interface for it.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the newly opened file is index.docbook then simply select the current job folder. if not, then select the current job folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is to be found.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus; ladet, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until somebody builds the tapped in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we start editing with the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all contained plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a storage location, & Quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & Quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to uniquely identify.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this is done by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identities) appears fat after which you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and attitudes of one's own identity are important in terms of news and notes. see for more information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Besides the overview of their team there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something is happening. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the Site Configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog can create, edit and delete events.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressees selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To enter notes is simple. either the note entry from the Editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword can be entered in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with nickname of the nominated nickname of the team member, is part of the project.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the parentheses and the names are invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& Quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD-agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Settings can be set up using Settings Quanta. this dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; with respect to tags, including car completion, can be modified.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Big / lower case of tags: big / lower case of automatically inserted tags. normal size / lowercase means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Big / lower case of attribute value: big / lower case of automatically inserted attributes. normal size / lowercase means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, for tags that the closing tag is optional, this is immediately added to the & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish day automatically: when enabled, the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. the default settings can be restored using button standard.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file Open Open files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is interrupted by the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies regularly, so that during a power failure or crash the document can be restored from this backup at the next startup of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Previewing and documenting can be displayed either in the editor area or in one's own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the default window settings to the default when the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the MDI modes and andocks / dependencies of views. it corresponds to the --resetLayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning messages area is used to control the display of warnings by means of hooks of non-inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The location for the behavior of & VPL; to change. it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPLs and the source code view in divided mode. see the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the figure of the parser nodes in the document, can be adjusted in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep is to be opened automatically during a change in the structure tree. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Shortcuts are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">This is where the plugins can be managed. plugins are part applications from third side that can be re-used by any part-enabled application, most well-known & konqueror. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standarthere like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at the start, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "component in" "" "Read-Only" "" "mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only read-only parts usually refuse the load if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then tests & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, then save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; added.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to debugging requests. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger so that it is not necessary to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counter to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and to continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is started, the script will start with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if a request is given, the execution begins as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where it becomes erroneous when possible in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work of Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg that you can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works by Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how you can and quantaplus; help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to provide support for markup- and scripting languages as well as & CSS; you enable & quantaplus; your simplicity and flexibility makes aus & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages, and & CSS; & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag folder contains two file types, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag folder contains handy, symbolic pastes of image buttons (above the editing window), insert text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see details for converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of writing errors.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folder. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carries the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but does not contain anything other than the only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for tag class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for the method method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only happen once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. additionally, it contains other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill out the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tag name%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that groups the elements of a list together. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a merely element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text within a dialog. this tag can only happen once for each attribute in a dialog (for example, once for each attribute; type &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each field; att &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag).</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Gives a list of elements that end a day. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neatly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt;, especially in elements like & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; replace.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; -Window to start and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear, its simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, verification is only performed when loading TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 tag XML file. this file describes & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tag XML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this tag XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD editing DTD settings. this can be edited diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should create a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = displacement 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut assigned to this action. clicking the user defined button can be assigned a key shortcut; with Kone, the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the defined settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but thereon it is not limited), which can change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), are started. examples from & quantaplus; even are the quick start dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. On this way, & quantaplus; the script in the following localities: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replacing the current document URL. in the case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus, process. if only one instance is running, the text unique will be added to the PID number. this is useful when using DCOP for the control of & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script input from & quantaplus can be used; in the input field input, it is possible to specify what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, to the standard output output. it can be specified, which should be done with the text written to the standard output, by setting the value in the selection box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in any case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all necessary fields and add the day to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them, enable dialog "Edit Tag" when available, so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; by default uses 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is mostly as loose, starte, further interpreted), or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startled; -tag to insert in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this is done through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are still some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; add functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to several groups for a better overview. open the toolbars setting dialog on Settings toolbar. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who doesn't know my tool bar might think the & konqueror; -Button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "the new toolbar must be tested by" "" "try" "" "all symbols to ensure everything works." ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after New XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their tool bar (s) is loaded (will) when a file is opened by the respective type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might want to check in & quantaplus; - Repository if someone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in & PHP; documentation like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # with Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus, resource files.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that serves to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context List) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simply and after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this is good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, for example which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & Quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the different resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at different places there is an email-send menu entry, such as the DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool-like tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. the entries are checked and only available if our team needs them as correct and useful for the publication. in order to make a single contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it requires a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New Resource dialog, the input fields have to be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and start uploading by clicking OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbars toolbar, and started in the template and Scripts tree context menu of files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, investigated & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. please read the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tagXML format. there is the easier way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definition bar: the string that appears in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are a few key concepts. in order to understand these and to take full advantage of & quantaplus, one must first acquaint oneself with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; used, available. from toolbars to actions everything is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this enables the group of administrators to secure different toolbar, actions and patterns in the global tree, which then are available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory so that only this user can use them personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which embeds the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the Editor window, the tree views, the tabs with information and the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all the tabs, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu on the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste / paste), edit the tags under the mouse-cursor, help the word under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window, the tool bars of the editor are located. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, for example & lt; paste; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) enable to navigate and roam in the information to & quantaplus. in the presentation with tabs are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool, the & quantaplus; provides. this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website, etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of structuring in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script. by clicking with the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or email it.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right clicking an element, a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it, it can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the content-oriented one-way system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can include project-specific documentation, edit and review.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two tabs at the bottom of the window, can be accessed using the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & Quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & Quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a tool bar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus, files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting with & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of its bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& Quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & Quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to occupy themselves with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already far along the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; for this the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; development community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; affolding it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& Quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity dramatically. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and has been quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is not in any way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is provided with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; type, or help khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. each time you open a file that is not on it, the oldest record will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look into the section on Templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting from the clipboard there special characters for & HTML; -Note, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; -Note which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script executes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Starting and switching the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries forecasts or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available modes of transportation depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus, the project managed. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project tool bar. these are stored in project you / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your tool bars. allows you to select the type of tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be set by means of Settings actions... can be added. toolbars are stored on toolbar toolbars or you will be asked when you are asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus, team so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; you or someone else has made and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities are to be freshened out of the & DTEP; without updating the whole & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting using tool bar denies if this day is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the above mentioned menu items. click on it. click an activated plug-in and deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the type; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line-end identifier. very useful if you know people using other OS platforms for developing. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes take time or cause unpleasant graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode corresponding to the presentation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. with selection of an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the status bar display at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application using the KHTML part, including & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & posters, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones and modify sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but has not yet been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& Quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus, development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, for example after completing the project name the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">There is the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adaptation might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and edit. in case of server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to go differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Be hooked when files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started anew from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection of good mandices.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the files you want by hooks or, by removing the hook, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the sub-window profiles or with the keyboard shortcut Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible) that are ignored for project related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles sub-pane, upload profiles (see in) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by trimming its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added, changed or deleted. event actions are executed when a particular event occurs, such as saving a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & Quantaplus, the last project that was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project or Symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog Project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus, closed, the project file is automatically saved. you are asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project supervision gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing opening and opening with... right-click on the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will disappear to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by programmers. this option is useful when a frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk save option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind prior to uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & Quantaplus, many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a risk. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the project or project toolbar, accessible via settings toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bars in & quantaplus; the best way to make use of the toolbar toolbar. using and adding differ. adding tool bars is handled at the bottom of the Add Toolbar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons can be set using context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action, a New toolbar can be created, can be used to specify other actions such as toolbars, rename tool bars, or set toolbars, which can be specified in the dialog where actions on these or other tool bars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will also be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu with settings... and set settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code cutlets and files for linking. & Quantaplus, basically uses templates like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in such cases the restrictions you present for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is anything that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, i.e. pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written by any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. usually more specific documents are placed in appropriate subfolders. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl-base. some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve whole Web sites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that has happened, note that (even if it was saved as a project template), the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template to save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be drawn simply by dragging and dropping onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as dragging and dropping or pasting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project file tree view, then select a site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, the project folder is backed up, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can set headers and footers or dynamically work with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as parental attributes are acquired.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder would be set, it would explicitly activate templates in this path unless they were explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows predefined or restructured text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers by copying content templates into a folder with special headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing to the right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& Quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor, which can be accessed from the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back to source editor if necessary, in which the changes performed in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document containing & PHP; a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; it is still the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously. pressing F9 this mode is activated, the button moves the active cursor from one window to the other, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set via settings Quanta.... By selecting VPL; -View you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation is: a small gap for fast machines and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, tools can be selected. thus, editing invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor is possible. the document properties dialog is also called upon as soon as a new document is created using the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow saving information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. one click into the list allows changing the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating the look of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving with arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strange. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting it by means of a button or removing button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way across the toolbars, as in the source editor. it is important to note that inserting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the table assistant or the Listen Wizard are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; work, in this release, the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for investigation of style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for specific elements is possible and the style template design can be tracked.</seg>

<seg id="2275">Several commands require more than one argument. quotation marks can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument. & eg; with the command "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as argument, a stop is placed in a file called "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly was changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, any number of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; indicates the exact differences and is similar to the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by writing only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting from the file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog remembers your selection and displays it next time. you do not have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, but for B and C a folder, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field for target is active and can be edited. however, it is not strictly necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can specify options before starting comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the opening dialog you do not have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you'd need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; load them and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can extract nothing from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret dragging and dropping text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The information line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed using the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you can see the color that differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. this is good to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line breaks is enabled, the line is dotted with dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the reference windows) also has an Info line with the output:, the file name and [Change] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe buttons to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference must also be resolved manually at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. this group will then highlight the current group.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group due to automatic merging or by manual editing. this is only a placeholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps select another source again. this text will not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go cautiously with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources, ignoring the numbers or ignoring Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, up, down, side up, side down, beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the add button, you can switch between plug-in and over-write mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns will synchronize the view of all windows at the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-image upward / Ctrl-image downward) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the tag to the clipboard, press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). there is also the option selection automatically copied. if this is enabled, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and eliminating manual copying. be careful with this option, because you may accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline thrust utility\, and Win32-based systems use car return + newlines\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved when loading and restored at the next start. (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you shouldn't use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italic script will be displayed. if the selected script does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors might not be available in their pure form but would be rendered toastly. on these systems, the button Preferences automatically adjusts an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the indentation of the previous line will also be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copying to the clipboard is then dropped.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer for saving. the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white signs can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart-return character '\\ r' and a newline thrust '\' at the end of one line, others save only one line feed '\'. if this option is checked, cart returns are made visible, but as a white sign. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is skipped.</seg>
<seg id="2335">(default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter to scan folders and perform a merge. see documentation for directory comparison and merging for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need to & kdiff3; quit and restart so that the change is active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available, because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the top setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">There is a short notice about the encoding fields for coding which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">(note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you might only want to see the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; & gt; C or B & lt; & gt; C or B & lt;</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply leave the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison windows next to each other or overlapping. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you view the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own pre-processor that matches your needs. for example, you can use this function to cut out disturbing parts or correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is passed to this external command first. if a normal preprocessor command has been specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this preprocessor command. the output of the command is only used with the line query. you can write your own pre-processor that matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line synchronization to convert the input to uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword to create $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessing command for line synchronization. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Any sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the substitutions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can use something else like perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / SCHALTER 'However, some details are different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the newline algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-up preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folders, a small message window informs about current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folders, only the files that have been compared will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan will be shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on + / - or by double-clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories and open all sub-directories with which you can open or fold up all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed of problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a file and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a file and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified, and if the option directories are active synchronize. then & kdiff3; the necessary action out so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option to select new file instead of merge (unsure) is enabled, then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date is identical.. As long as such errors are not removed, merging the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, a file is processed after the other. it indicates the status column when merging successfully, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. when merging is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When a file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unsolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the resolved conflict column is only shown when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the just selected entry (file or debtor), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (even in all subfolders), you can start the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the Three-folder merge mode C is used as target, B is selected as target in the two folder merge B and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries should be in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options that might skip certain entries.</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the list menu or press F7 (key shortcut). to only merge the current entry, select the action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by conflicting file types still invalid merge actions exist, a message appears that points to the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When merging all entries, a dialog box appears with the Browse, Simulate and Cancel options.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulations if you want to see what would happen without actually making changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (notice the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, choose again the directory merge / continue or press F7. if you have not saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to resolve the cause of the problem. if you continue the merging continue (F7 key), & kdiff3; you have the option to choose another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually & kdiff3, these entries (in the current session) will not be combined again. even if the merge action has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered as dealt with. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be remerged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified sample are displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon; valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-formatted files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be set folder-specific with a .cvsignore file. (look under info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hiding attribute. in other file systems, a previous point selects a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to Folder: if the option is disabled, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively browses. (note that & kdiff3; does not lead to possible recursions.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) Full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the modified date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of the modification date. no real comparison takes place. the files are considered identical if they are equal to size. this can, for example, be useful when copying the modified date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical. the results from merging files are also stored in both folders.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, the copy of the newer file is suggested as an action. (this is considered unsafe because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been changed too. you should check it in any case.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it is deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view is visible while merging single files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. nevertheless, there is a corresponding menu entry in the list menu. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. once you save the result, the status will be set to completion and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost if you re-read the directory: menu -Menu: reread</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KNO3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively und. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, Space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished from a link to a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, permissions or change date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first starts the built-in differences viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In KDiff3Part, view from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is applied as a part, & kdiff3; that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then, & kdiff3; the name of the original files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">You can click on a patch file in the Konqueror and select Preview - KDiff3Part from the context menu. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; run as part, it supports only the comparing of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot compare) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably don't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default, configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). see the README file for more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical, but if only a non-white sign is different, the line will not be treated as identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, no src appears; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misuse the purpose. please use another editor for that.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3, you need to & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have problems with compiling. if difficulties occur, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift Insert) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder with the update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files to be copied into the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later version of the program).</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the A, B and C tab under the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual workspaces. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, quit them or move them. this works both within a working area and with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; movement is possible both within a working area and on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu only has the two entries Pager to set... and Finish. if, however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries will also appear to minimize, maximize, apply to desktop and exit. the commands make the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, you can move windows within the & Cpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is selected, the & Kpager will display the names of the virtual desktops.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field allows the & Kpager to display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is displayed along with name, the names will be provided with order numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is selected, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is selected, the running programs will be shown as small windows in & pager; otherwise only empty workspaces are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply displays simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the order of the & Kpager; the main window can be determined: classically & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, as from pager applications appear in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual working areas in a horizontal and vertical range, which is very well suited for viewing on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, view and move the windows as symbols or with their content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Rightclick within & Kpager; and then set up switch settings... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you will need a functioning installation of the KDE key packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you like it, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; shows the enlarged area of the screen. the image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, & kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a mobile loupe. alternatively, you can create a selected area of the screen in the magnification window (selection window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse pointer persists for a while at the same location. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) Syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that occurs when you click the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, the mere moving of the mouse can cause pain. if you suffer from pain related to your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain that occurs when you click with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and executes a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, it makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button emulates. move now the mouse, wait until the release of the mouse button is executed. this way you can drag the drag while pressing the mouse button. the intelligent sliding requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be stowed after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intelligible shifting is enabled, the shooting field is active (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool will be activated. after pressing the mouse button, the mouse button is waiting to release if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function activates, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double-click. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool; the first time is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the reaction time. open the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and click the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer, which you set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">When this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde. at GNOME or other windows environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog. if you have already pressed the button Apply, the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">It is best to use & kmousetool, first with default settings. in particular, the intelligent move should be turned off at first. if you get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later move the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make yourself aware of which places a mouse-click is without effect: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is rucking, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can scrape the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the intelligent move in this case, that means & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to perform a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very easy to mark text, copy it to the clipboard and insert any other action you want to move the mouse over pressed mouse button. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool; instead mark text as follows: drop a mouse click at one end of the text area and press the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. as a result, each time you click & kmousetool, the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. you know exactly when the moving time begins when moving smart. later you can use the intelligent shift even without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool, the XTest extension for & X Window has to be installed. this should already be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker and is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse cursor as soon as the mouse pointer persists. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and which causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a drag action to start before the mouse button is released. thus, dragging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2625">A message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a website, you can welcome someone who is entering the room. & kde; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you send from the map card is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output of longer texts, which do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queues except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such reads, this issue is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to regular warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there are still more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Drawing boxes replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is supplied with predefined string replacement filters, which allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformat messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With voice selector filtering, you can send jobs depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the map board for example, you can read text by KDE messages about it. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules after which it is used for voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it continues to pass the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters created on the page below. processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of standard filters. if a filter is not selected, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the following setup dialogs will be displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern for the creation of character chain replacement filters. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the respective replacement text. upper and lower case is not considered when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it just has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save the current list or delete. download a list from a file, the entries are appended from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks one of the languages entered here. click the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs are available with the program qdbus; the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if, for example, & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string assertion filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions match an entry in the box Diesen Filter if agree. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string substitute filter uses regular expressions in the\\ s word\\ s. thus words must be limited by delimiters (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions. if you have the & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; Regular & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions you will find in the package kdeutils.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; Transforms Transforms & XML; using XSLT files from a format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such transformations. it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc User Language program. if xsltproc is accessible via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">The speaker selector selector allows you to send texts to a specific speaker set up on the map board, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that text from kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; there is a text to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that specify the program, which sends the text to & ktts; with the speaker selection filter, you can overwrite the chosen speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is on your system the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it with a click on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected, which corresponds best to the desired requirements. click the button on the right to view the dialog box selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The voice output API, from & kde;, with which programmers can give their applications TTS abilities. applications communicate with KTTSD via & dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API can be added to the KTTSD language synthesizer so that & ktops; this synthesizer can use.</seg>
<seg id="2660">The following section contains a brief description of the & kde; -DBus; interface of the voice output API of & kde; the full documentation for both APIs can be found on the ken; Accessibility website (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).</seg>

<seg id="2665">None of the mentioned language synthesizers supports my language. where can I get a synthesizer for my speech?</seg>
<seg id="2666">I created the & HTML; -XML; -re-formerfilter, but when using the module for festival web pages are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Due to an error in festival 1.95 beta, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone so that Sable does not work at all. you must also do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages. also, make sure the program xsltproc is installed and can be found via the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain characters or interpunctuation characters seem to cause errors in synthesizers, so that whole sentences are skipped or only masticatfish is spent. what can I do about it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First, make sure the option character encoding is set to the right value for the appropriate language. if there are problems with certain characters or words, they may be corrected by a string substitute filter. see.</seg>

<seg id="2677">Speech Dispatcher uses a customizable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand and extend the use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc User Language program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compile, you need a current KDE development environment (Version 3.4 or later) including packages of kdelibs and the development files for the speech-scheduler program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code of & ktts; extract from the source code archive for kdeba or have downloaded any of the currently created tarball, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktts, first check if speech dispatcher works correctly with your voice synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program ttmsgr should be further developed so that the creation of speech-dispatchers is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual sentences. the user can go back to set or paragraph mode, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application passes text to & ktts, you can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have set up a speaker, whose language is English and its gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best suitable speaker will be selected automatically. if you want to know more about it, like & ktts; a speaker selects, you will see in after.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on Add to add a speaker on the map or click Edit, the Poster Set will be displayed. as an example, the set-up of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. details of the modules can be found below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival in PATH is included, you just have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is passed to festival. if voices, the & ktts, are known, this setting will be made automatically. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you adjust volume, voice speed, and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some regulator and display this grey, the voice you choose does not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first set is synthesized faster (with bigger memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet created a speaker (or forget to click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected at the start of ktmgr the program window is displayed. otherwise, only the symbol ttsmgr is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message. & ktts; processes four types of language orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. after the output of the screen reader has been read, the retained jobs are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News is the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that evokes messages. if you & eg; just read a long text on a web site, you can welcome to & kmouth; nevertheless someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, add & ktts; insert the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and syntax detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into single propositions. this can begin by synthesized the first set, since only the first set does not need to be synthesized, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limit detection filters. at the first start of & ktts, a set of rules identifier filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add further set identifier filters, but beginners will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn is to set up the language selection by trying. turn on the selector selection and enter text to read. turn on the selector selection, change some properties and check how the selector selector changes. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then proceed faster with the pre-reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a very long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can pause or cancel assignments on the map card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start ktusmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything to this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limit recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tab character (decimal code 8) to the set boundaries (tab characters are automatically removed from the text in front of the filter). note that the standard set of rules defines the punctuation filter.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limit detection filter from default, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The language selector selector selector allows you to overwrite the language settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the map board). in other words: no speaker characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of a subscribed speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & ktts; this speaker. otherwise, & ktts; the speaker is the most likely to match the originally set characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired language features by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the characteristics of the desired speaker. if this feature does not matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have precedence over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">As the language is a critical factor in getting the output, it is always treated as the prime property. you will rarely use this property. the only case in which you might want to specify the language is, if you know that a particular application will send text in a different language than that set in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the spokesperson range, which is best suited to the following, click the standard speaker selector and then use the speaker that is best suited to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number, input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Ktmgr crashes when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer has crashed and / or has been terminated. you probably need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not resolved, a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update or uninstall Streamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work when I play music at the same time with another application. if I receive a text order, it freezes & tts; a. on the & Console; appears a message stating 'Unable to open PCM'.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at ALSA which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. please refer to the ALSA-project website (dmix) on www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but respectful does not display this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice to the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocals. if this is successful, please send a patch together with the & URL; on which you have found the voice, to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program needs to be installed sox and can be found via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizermodules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed themselves on the map board for speaker setup. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored if & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because HTML is converted into SSML.) Disactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML conversion filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage websites to be read with a female voice. I set up a female festival spokesman, but & gt; read the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. in order for festival to produce no mistakes, the xsl file will reject the GENDER tags for converting SSML to Saber. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own character chain replacement filter and now I can go back or forth in & ktts; no more set-up or go back. on the map tab orders will be shown, the job consists only of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You are not allowed to filter punctuation marks (dot, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). instead use a filter for syntax detection instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure that the modules are registered for GStreamer by calling in & ktts before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience conflicts in audio output in connection with ALSA. if your system also counts, you can't play music at the same time and read a text. & ktops; also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another. you can find possible solutions for this problem on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current sentence is still read.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the speech speed, but otherwise it is not necessarily necessary. Debian users can install as x with the apt-get install sox command. the program is already included in most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you have downloaded the tarball (with tar packed archive), login as normal user and unpack the tarball into a suitable folder. change to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least only created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a runtime dependency of non-free software. (non-free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2765">As default, & ktts; in / opt / kde3 installs. if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you must specify as an option --prefix = target. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2766">On Debian systems, / usr / local is the correct folder for programs that are translated from sources.</seg>
<seg id="2767">CD kdearecho kttsd &gt; inst-apps make -f macefile.cvs. / configure cd kttsd make su make install</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before using & ktts, first check if your voice synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions that you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers, whose source code is obvious. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help you find in the instructions provided with festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices, you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. choose a Cyrillic (8-bit) coding, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">The festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, select the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which enables management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a standardized integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetwork.conf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter will be displayed; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and allows setting the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing & Linux; installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by matching the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Preferences module is loaded if the option Network Setting in & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which best suits the distribution and the releasestand. by selecting the non-re-ask setting the setting can be made permanent. the next start of the network settings will then automatically set this selection.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously all options are shown gray, meaning the settings can only be considered, the change is not possible. by clicking the button system management mode, you will get to the right lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The system management mode provides the full functionality of the module. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the tab network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the dialog box to be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the Selection Automatically the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are done at the same time with the start of the system services. DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further setting is required. either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without dhcp or BOOTP. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address needs to be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & Console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching on a switched on network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching off an activated network device can be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host on the local subnet that conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS resolves this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator part of the holder name resolution allows for easy administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified. DNS entries can be re-ordered by selecting an entry or upgrading or downgrading in the list with the buttons Hinauf or Herod.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator for name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button....</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list includes name-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list includes some known hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this version of IP is still to be replaced in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... Add the New Alias dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known host and click the Add button. if the known machine has multiple alias names, de Button add multiple times and enter the additional alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Called Computer will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then by clicking OK, the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & Console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages), it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & Console; using rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde does not suffice; in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended for experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second section all of & knetworkconf; configurable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found widespread use. from IPv6 it is expected that it is going through in the near future. this description therefore focuses on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned. in foreign networks, at & eg. the network administrator is the contact person to assign a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not relayed on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address is assigned 127.0.0.1 of its own loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files created by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it is not surprising if there is another content in case of active DSL connections to be found there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is randomly sorted by scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which additionally offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective unpacking. the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be connected to & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; discard the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognize & kdat; not the pre-credits on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the pre-credits, it searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been incorporated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be browsed by folding the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a message in the status bar. the band can now be dropped without any danger.</seg>

<seg id="2901">A tape drive must be formatted before being used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat; if your tape drive requires formatting a tape before use, it must be formatted before using the tape. floppy disks usually do not require formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity drives & kdat; with formatting the tape. all data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically included and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a security profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Rightclick the local file tree and select from the View menu...</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to re-create the tape index file using the tape content. this procedure deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a security profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current job folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the newly elected job folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files located in the same file system are backed up, such as the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the tar call. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons & gt; & lt; lt; lt; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to device file for tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is included, the command mt load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; lock the ejection at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when releasing the inclusion of & kdat, the band is automatically ejected. do not use this option for floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; to change the hardware block size for tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need to share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The Band-ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The Band-ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be edited directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, try to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the various options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open. if this is not shown, then you have & ksystemlog; most likely not with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log, for the normal user usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or after entered strings. then enter a string of string into the filter bar. the list of the log lines will now be automatically displayed, so that only a protocol line is displayed, if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be compared to the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the process name, and then log in the name of a process in the filter bar, so it shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines which were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color than note lines of the level critic. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the Process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new add-in lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu pane to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find more current information about & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also, in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archiv</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly develops to the standard for controlling the program starts at boot-up of the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I won't go into historical aspects here (among others because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start when you boot the system or when you move to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run out something that has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default runner level 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you will get it repaired by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop.</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is called stop with the argument. if it contains an S, the script is invoked with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel that lets just httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; running. in addition, I could also have a user-runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; using a mouse or a different pointing device is simple to not trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this only happens if you extract an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it by cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are recovered from & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveling, and now the machine restarts constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the Enter key to start in single user mode. then, edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runner level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; designed for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services in these distributions are started simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; schedule an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are present which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache httpd) simply exit without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that it can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you must save it. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two tabs, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double-click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have extended system settings. only when you have activated space constraints (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings. additional flashcards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card may appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD -Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least one embedded file system limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the limited space restrictions in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field filesystem with limited space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The group of cards to which the user belongs, can be found in the field Primary group. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works similarly.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the standard operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, modify operating systems, remove, modify and more.</seg>
