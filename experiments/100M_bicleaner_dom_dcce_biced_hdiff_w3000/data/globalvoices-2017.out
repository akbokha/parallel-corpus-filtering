although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he walks with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops his mind behind the mountain as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can pre @-@ election was the highest number that a nomin@@ ee nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not harmon@@ ize Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I got to know in Phoenix during my time .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , who receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past .
also , Tr@@ ump didn &apos;t agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ ump intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
while Tr@@ ump paved his way to the nom@@ inees repub@@ li@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
maybe it &apos;s unfair to call the plat@@ ters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , have voted for tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps . maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comm@@ enting on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( C@@ WC . : as much as &quot; White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; p@@ un @-@ play from white in all@@ usion to the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much like sk@@ id@@ al trauma ) , as the big Van Jones called , has killed exactly what America has made so magnificent .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
however , with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump , a huge part of the White Americas is giving up this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say .
with all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is Tr@@ ump Land now , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican Music School of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Municip@@ ality in O@@ ax@@ aca province have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds apart from nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the commune , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs .
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered a rare hope for the youth .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they come and play with shiny eyes and play in the h@@ ust@@ le and bu@@ stle you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Wa@@ ste
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest land@@ fill site in Paragu@@ ays &apos;s capital - are based on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments consisting of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion all produced from the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something that he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of re@@ structured material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill harmon@@ ics follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already had illegal fishing in the liber@@ i@@ anic waters before it picked up the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were therefore upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind in their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give it a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior member of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pil@@ la@@ ging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing .
the members of this network are the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , who then expelled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information and join each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is by definition un@@ regulated : what is caught is hidden , causing it to be extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are today in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses for example , news of suspi@@ cious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ tively pursu@@ es the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas - such as those who suggest that a ship loads his captured fish on the way to other ships .
in an ideal case , such examinations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the road and , eventually , whether they have a pen@@ al code .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile financially . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultancy firm advoc@@ ating the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supporting F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i lose every year because of the illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries that attract the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world .
among other things , actions include sailing under false flag , bog@@ us license papers , speci@@ fying fantasy names , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamless organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship was illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now the closed front operates .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has exposed criminal networks that spread fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information about illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships they like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping build a system that connects different information levels with each other . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i is supposed to help identify criminal vessels with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence that without a doubt the global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world using the position of each track@@ able vessel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who &apos;s doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them .
ships that previously had been fishing without a license and had hardly had to face consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ ing nets which were forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
six countries joined the West Africa Task Force in 2015 . they are now comb@@ ating illegal fishing , after exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; With security , the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s most recent member country Somalia was able to announce its first major triumph : in October , it presented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship had also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works across the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating further : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of &quot; re@@ inv@@ ading the country &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are considered as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the inauguration , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into void , when they assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the re@@ funds of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located Bun@@ de@@ staat Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is constantly wor@@ sen@@ ing , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ an by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but eventually the sec@@ rec@@ y of a re @-@ election of the official authorities was blocked .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government resolution as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( approximately : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called on the demonstr@@ ators to join the elections of 2015 to the majority of representatives of the opposition .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows :
Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil war and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches , published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter images are pil@@ ed up showing disputes , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
especially large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own testimony against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already accounts for the extent of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure - which has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado affir@@ m that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your removal !

others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from their point of view , under@@ took a little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and preferred to let the critical voices be blocked :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Cor@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba .
in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation back then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ist . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 at La Per@@ la prison .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the magnitude of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose for himself a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went into the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with one of the ERP .
just watch that they don &apos;t kid@@ nap you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that was fine .
at the base of the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were stopped and stopped me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sat inside and saw a couch where men were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a camp bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been captiv@@ ated there .
they rarely tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw him with water and hun@@ ted him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was terri@@ fic ... like a dirty no@@ od@@ le .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing eyes .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to information from survivors , the civil servant Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , condemned the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way where the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be la@@ yed .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that you take off an enemy that you have fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , record players , clothes , paintings , money ... then that is not war boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to inv@@ ade a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and scre@@ amed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
as I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle pul@@ lover of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still took home clothes .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a co @-@ con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me on the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the enforced disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I &apos;m older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once children have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ nap children ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their corp@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not have families to whom they could hand over their mortal remains ?
the enforced disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they brought machinery to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were grin@@ ded and taken away somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something always remains .
&apos;@@ I &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the idea of displaying my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities I had to witness because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , show me up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I issued the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can blame me for being bi@@ ased . I finally testified against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes including severe , un@@ lawful imprisonment in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced in 28 cases to prison sentences and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .

all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees .

he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :

&quot; &quot; &quot; translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend his driving licence .
the photograph was distributed in the social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence , last month witnessed a very mis@@ fortune translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrong@@ ly , but also with malicious h@@ ul@@ lab@@ ors &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1 to 20 .
editing the original portrait by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could there be such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and simply unacceptable in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents suffered from sen@@ iors in 2005 . this equ@@ ates to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors made 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased during the same period .
the above mentioned repor@@ ter brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ ap against older drivers :
the article on the translation error has , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How faulty is the translation at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
for example , French native speakers should translate from English into French - not English into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue , who could make translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ searching , or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .

machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and mysterious pro@@ positions resulting from machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling im@@ prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .

translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery or at least harmless . however , by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , more accurate translations can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship actions on the internet and television take
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they would not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer available .
other online tran@@ smit@@ ters also contributed footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups who oppose the Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros government .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and deleg@@ ated the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was app@@ alled and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are closed again .
that is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 when reporting about protests . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission regarded this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
I have signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
it &apos;s amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online tran@@ smit@@ ters . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , has shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server will respond in@@ correctly or refuse the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , was suspended on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was det@@ ained .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it more difficult for the Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multi @-@ media coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get a training
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and ga@@ thers testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a cur@@ tural report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she could not eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from the university she returned to the house again and heard the owner of the house proudly speaking about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , there are more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money gives her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more mature family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children will have to perform countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this in the context of a treaty that one cannot abol@@ ish .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ adi@@ tas is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family who has their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies their exploitation with faith that they give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education and perhaps even star@@ ve .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent be@@ atings . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military doctor Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as an official at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra had a stick on Mar@@ ín until it suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be deployed in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay than children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to inf@@ ringe the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the couple &apos;s neighbors and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a quick investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be indic@@ ative - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go in court .
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to declare bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work and began to sell cand@@ y on the street or in the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she got up against five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but did not get unlimited food either . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ant of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the owner of the house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and to read editorial papers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her Lord feared that she would lose the education that she had made possible to lose again , she explains .
it was quite clear , however , that she had paid for everything that she got from them with her hard work .
even at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken of is mo@@ b@@ bing and the har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of a group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where job advertisements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls can be shared in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came out of Ñ@@ aco offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the country that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the advertisement in the ad switched on again :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with it .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ h@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long still ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í were ens@@ la@@ ved ) and the system of Mens@@ ú ( where the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of Mens@@ ú ( where the workers were considered as semi @-@ slaves ) .

bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ulations on Use and Use of Social Networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to allow citizens to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make the registration . it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ler , member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al @-@ Monitor &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall blocking Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . so it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Institute &quot; ) at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that in the same way that they control physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who require a permit or not . and that is a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to lead them to a trial process .
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and to ensure that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the parliamentary deputy Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was fores@@ een for those who are found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; insti@@ g@@ ating protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the northeast of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and their team of scientists from the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the le@@ op@@ ards that wi@@ pes through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only survi@@ ving pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a likes to show a different side of her country , which is not just a war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to establishing protected areas for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for northeast Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a total pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami resulting from it .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring Coun@@ t@@ ess Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
still , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident , already alone that &apos;s why 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view which progress was achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of those affected .
the residential building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( de@@ composed , de@@ composed , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
nevertheless , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ac@@ ess@@ ences ( de@@ br@@ is , can@@ y@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) would be reloc@@ ated to final spare @-@ houses .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old disaster , nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in comfort shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , more than 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated homes were moved to final homes after the disaster .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 per cent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i fishing har@@ bours are in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of land @-@ destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has been re@@ covering as far as possible , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still remains behind .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 per cent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show up to 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn a living .
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous interviews among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated ones . she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feeling changed against the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents found that there was still not enough work in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
how it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ate from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition commemor@@ ating the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the location of the evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness to the worst , disa@@ strous , nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced .
of 160@@ ,000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses .
more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture after 2017 .
most of the evacu@@ ations in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across people from other countries who speak another language , the differences seem to be greater than common ground .
after a while , however , one often notices that one connects more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten down by the police at nationwide demonstrations

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , a police officer had hit him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a blow @-@ stick . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officers how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ eur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel by media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video filmed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly thereafter rush to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also bath@@ ed in social networks .
the clip shown below shows the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and permit his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás has witnessed a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group was killed , only to crimin@@ alize teachers , and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who was attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a blow on his face .
police Hand@@ les
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only country in Brazil , in which last Friday , brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators came .
at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , polic@@ emen set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported on a broken glass window to illustrate its front pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window screen than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of material damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the In@@ indu@@ str@@ alization of For@@ gotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the municipality Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it has been two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after the decline , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and sw@@ add@@ ling daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
need@@ less to say that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich I would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
a few decades ago , the news would have been a subject of concern for the country , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry eliminated ?
the old platform of the community saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and they were hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation .
if the present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate ca . 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will go into history with certainty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the de@@ commissioning of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about closing the factory , is the word that he repe@@ ats most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all those questioned are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first Jubilee , the first letters began to come .
these were officially written documents which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was delayed and the letters became more and more frequent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ continued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills still in operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important plum@@ ber was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work sites and services generated by the plants in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the people of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to mi@@ tig@@ ate , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ate the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other companies .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to locate other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people suddenly left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring to the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a follow@@ er person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes into retirement for 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter .

young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with issues that are important to them . they do it through hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop will make it possible for the young participants to engage in talks such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever it makes sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway der tears , &quot; a road section in Western Canada where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people didn &apos;t always command the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as is a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I am trying to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take away our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that one day we will lift ourselves up
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and move forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they determined the Creator
in the commentary section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and add the St@@ rop@@ he in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ font ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; &quot; &quot; plastic dishes ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of any food served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers watch these plastic dishes and then decide whether they can enter or continue the restaurant .
there is an entire industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ oter district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a multitude of these small companies producing plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into striking cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets today .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic decorated cell phone bands as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food production is becoming more and more complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also produced this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some Handy @-@ Stand and Handy @-@ Designer allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasantly .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand @-@ held tapes of dried salmon .
you can look at other whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry . like for example , the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed are regularly appearing only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , Chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of innumerable parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drugs traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Fear Chang@@ ed Life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells the story exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on only one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are again preparing for the task we set ourselves to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment it has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay it out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and journ@@ alism for several years now .
I get past newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the compos@@ ure .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified with the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not touch and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was sack@@ ed with threats . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals squee@@ zed money out of their business month by month , until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are away from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested because they don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked if tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation signed by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , roast potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was already past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Council for Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages to which he links , contain pictures depicting violence .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or to expose fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what about the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ led to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tank wagon crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ cked around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es , which were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to it .
officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses envel@@ oped including a movie theater nearby , which was full of people watching the Football World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ ted corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to in@@ convenience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at them .
but this is not the end of history .
over the years , the same photo has been ti@@ pped several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real , but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses drastically reported atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
reports were reported , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left behind to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be depicted figur@@ atively .
the attack was also un@@ resolved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the DR Congo image is only one in a series of mis@@ nom@@ inations ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely affect the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments .
the picture taken from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning report published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee could strike , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page fal@@ sely claiming that President Burma &apos;s Th@@ ein has said that monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image of DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , accessed last on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed their testimony to Th@@ ein , but had not related the picture from the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings date back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private pages , platforms of social media and community and national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have sent false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of ab@@ u@@ sive usage and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which side they were published . thus , we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been connected ) , several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use may come from .
here are some cases that can now be fully felt ( on the orange map ) :
card : News frames .
country examples of incorrect cop@@ pl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to sites or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ u , are likely to present for@@ gery examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this paper , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City ad@@ mits not only the fal@@ si@@ fication but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .

La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report has contained the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre as this one here , who used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster refu@@ te this .

this site used the image as evidence of Muslims killing Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fact @-@ check page in 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
an association of students of theology ( mul@@ lahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims via the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a resident of the P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o district of Tren@@ to posted this message on his site to express his solidarity with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shared as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am bombing in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , expressing sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , asser@@ ting asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a right to judge what it ple@@ dged to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately frau@@ dul@@ ent news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this judgment , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding molecules that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to set out that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often broadcast by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; f@@ antasi@@ es of a sensation ? &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) .
this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of DR Congo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely said that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein admitted being in 2012 , that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture continues to contain it at the time of this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , which is now deleted , has expressly declared that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the picture was later circul@@ ated in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to those events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre ( and ret@@ ou@@ ched more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam@@ ese , 2014 .
after a message that was supposedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a fal@@ si@@ fication .
the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves from the message contained in the DR Congo .
there are other confirmed examples of an er@@ ron@@ eous use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which previously appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture eventually carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is important both . it is therefore worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does it dimin@@ ish the horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal equ@@ als to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes these images are even asked by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images of readers and spectators are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing and taking the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how forci@@ ble media act to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used by the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , each investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how internationally they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
these words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( e.g. Spanish Sob@@ rei@@ esa ) .
but everyone stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt to make a simple translation .
a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist chose &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - we@@ ep for your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes you affect how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
speakers of Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite no@@ uns here .

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slides in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ spar@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have res@@ ig@@ ned .
after an opinion of the disaster relief centre of Sri Lanka on May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missed because of the floods and mud waves .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe places .
rainf@@ all dropped on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 metres . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ham@@ mer@@ ing the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the flood water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are completed to transport emergency supplies for the residents enclosed in their flooded villages .
also various organizations and startups have agreed to help .
Facebook pages , such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the taxi @-@ call @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster data center will be informed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ up introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flood aid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for pick up assistance and donations . these were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key that resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people enclosed by floods and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , bring residents in need in security and provide help .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka the long way to restoring norm@@ ality .
the Muslims that one cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust in her my four year old daughter ; she cle@@ aves to me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we call on slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next step we channels rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others chann@@ elled slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; built up in their imagination .
they were dem@@ or@@ alizing me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all see the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim in a variety of ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who like me do not fit into it , are being Muslim .
Ent@@ mus@@ lim@@ ated to be
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ? love ?
peace ? peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these images .
but these pictures also prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to understand it .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA did not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this narrative fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government will be forced to cover their entire body that these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has taken our collective imagination so deeply and er@@ ron@@ eous that often Si@@ kh men and children are becoming the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
belonging to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the 1.7 billion Nar@@ r@@ ative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims in the highest degree constitute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ American Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation migrants from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan re@@ thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we don &apos;t wear all T@@ ash@@ k@@ ites with us .
we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be a Muslim or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with financi@@ ers , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who ri@@ ps a woman &apos;s veil .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious lives , they rever@@ t to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf see that I &apos;m Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I hold her in my arms and whis@@ per her Arabic verses to the protection that seals the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim beliefs are always part of my shadow .

belonging is the image of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; as they have decades ago won a contest of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the image of her that I will see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings painted Su@@ fi r@@ attle ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be a Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I have a bad day .
to be a Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , which is God , my only Lord .
for a people that - over centuries - have been colon@@ ised by an empire , founded by a company called Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps .
in between , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept irre@@ versi@@ bly for his family in India @-@ dominated K@@ ash@@ mir family , which he could not close in half a century into his arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a Muslim means knowing that over the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ a sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent , apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave called Bil@@ al .
it is to know that two hundred years ago , an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives count .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , is the har@@ sh@@ ly inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ ess , but is represented in the reducing ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people set up structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is made up of Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration official who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that closes its limits to people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ F@@ ly @-@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that targets largely Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply advised to refrain from Muslim or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are coming back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous ima@@ gery we perpet@@ u@@ ate in our news editors .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ all Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sh@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increasingly Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global time point in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years before , they had not yet existed ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who made me a Muslim today .
things that I left here like a bread cr@@ umb track in my speech .
things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may lie where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations in the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islamic hos@@ tility take place .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people were given up by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public performance , was a scientist of Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being aware and un@@ aware of the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I think in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because of the occupation that we have no President , the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed broken lands and &quot; to other man @-@ made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban linguistic diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a possibility to connect here and now despite a language barrier with someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been hosting events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project , the following applies :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to it is often associated with understanding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events will instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen in order to appreciate , feel , touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain their story in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and their representation lead to the fact that the audience is involved .
they call out laugh@@ ing and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ingly tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . anyone inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling tours .
Puerto Rico demands re @-@ determination of public debt from the United States
with the aim of re@@ testing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started in the Vatican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ establishment of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico require that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt will be held responsible for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debts , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
this is why the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization with no party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on government responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
without the participation and conviction of the citizens , measures imposed from the outside will be at risk of being rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Vi@@ gil for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ na@@ y , a researcher of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) .
the book published last year and is available roy@@ alty @-@ free contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it reads :
this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are , with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side @-@ by @-@ side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet @-@ volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have not received any information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive reminder gives his friends and his family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , and instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we abandoned in this process from time to time extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , was transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el &quot; had taken part in A@@ dra as the &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal from his cell . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his place of residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technologi@@ sts and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes were more pres@@ cient than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the world &apos;s most important archaeological sites , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would make everything possible to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life to dream of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ re , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available for licence @-@ free .
cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose sight in the moment we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the prison of the prison
and I &apos;ll go into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and let me leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my sol@@ itude ,
to rec@@ la@@ im all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...

Bash@@ ar &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime in 2011 , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under forci@@ ble use by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we repeat our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : Director after release due to corruption again on previous post
Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption attack by which a member of the government returned to the state machine after half of his sentence against corruption .
this was Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defend@@ ants due to the em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( some 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds from Moz@@ ambique &apos;s airports , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with an opinion of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the motion , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to get back to his old position , as the company had no disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many residents do not welcome the action .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note of is that even the company should have initiated disciplinary proceedings against the infrin@@ gement .
the company seemed to be silent , however , and made no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media of Moz@@ ambique , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ ised &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which has been served .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
un@@ question@@ ably !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Moz@@ ambique student and a student of political science in Brazil , says the director does not have any moral :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state , because he ab@@ uses him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the moral to return and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remember the Moz@@ ambique as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was able to all , also to sell the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he doesn &apos;t . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reactions in Twitter also declined :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and escaped .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users wrong@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took its posts from the net because it contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely dimin@@ ishing con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for its use have been cens@@ ored .
moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ f@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the proposition ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very much , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before del@@ eting all posts suspected of rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words next .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech get quite a good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who is spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to extingu@@ ish his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from publishing , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; did not meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their views against hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author informed his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it doesn &apos;t work like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ ly deleted posts .
if they only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun of Facebook and deliberately writing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , heal people then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to control the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learn from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided on a law bann@@ ing this practice so that the age @-@ capable age is now at 18 .
in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , because age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined every person under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married between 1997 and 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements ende@@ avor@@ ing to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children , they should , dam@@ n &apos;t worry about their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tension in this actually un@@ complicated case , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all .
yet at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite four Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
now only the president of the country must agree and announce the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and not a single one against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws on children &apos;s marriage were finally am@@ ended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minister of the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that concealed the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson thought that it took a long time to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally arrived :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage network has been approved .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group which spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years independent of religious affili@@ ation .
the proposal to am@@ end the marriage network was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the voting .
all dep@@ u@@ ties who were opposed have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is legally no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ bearing shield abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought it .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization in the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take court steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to dissolve his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General , Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said that it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users desired that the debate on the subject would go differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , instead of keeping the discussion so general , instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply say that the state that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men that are in advantage to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it &apos;s not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit it .

by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia contents
the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright Law in the United States , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and popular En@@ cyclo@@ pedia on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day by day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ ade .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been taking place since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirror sites ( sites that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. host computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available in spite of the legal ban .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after hearing the news ( about the locking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents on a distributed and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites if locked in the respective country Wikipedia .

in essence , the server will forward the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and washed paints .
this motivated him to take a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested when Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) suddenly called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the river Rap@@ ti .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was , and immediately I started to take pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he was already standing face to face to Tig@@ ers ,
a tiger cannot be bo@@ thered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately sat down , we looked at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
but his passion for promoting N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to make recordings of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see some of these photos below .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been published once again as part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
in many parts of India , women with the greatest care must avoid the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to the social pressure they respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the indi@@ an State of O@@ dish@@ a by a head@@ light court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after she had mentioned a married relative with name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives is also common among men . however , they have far less rebu@@ ke to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and dedicated to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ war has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as child marriage to exile of HIV and AIDS infected , and leads these clubs .
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ adors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion was about women who didn &apos;t call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to speak out loud the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they all uph@@ old and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered to be a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that up to this discussion we never thought about it .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband stayed for a long time after the video was over .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked them all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does this mean that they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the names of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini says :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was only hiding in front of him ; another decided to release all the pent @-@ up fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to call their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
over the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the in@@ ox @-@ red dot on the forehead that shows the marriage status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ ced spot if he did it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not completely stopped doing so , but think that they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days .
for many women , the Dis@@ cussion Club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what they hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in their life they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties have been tied to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothes .
some women in the group have only borne Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to go on a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed .
to the question as to whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far , we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of their husband .
some , including myself , do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two still say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it &apos;s not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the Official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who had inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan .
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survived everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as for fans , jap@@ an@@ ese of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places that are connected with the band .

bald @-@ headed men are kidn@@ apped and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that men of bald men could be target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for dis@@ believing purposes , concerns the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently allowed to use the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald @-@ headed man could bring gold or bring wealth , declared the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks have been registered for men in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in the South African country carried out a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight against this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who would like to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are target ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambique police according to the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of bald men .
the persecution and killing of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ Rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for probably dis@@ believing rituals , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth .
in the last few days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook , Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME ashamed A country where people would be ashamed to offer sex against good marks , work and other achievements , a nation in which people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald headed for dis@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; will be hun@@ ted .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re humor could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both smu@@ g@@ gled :
Moz@@ ambique authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald @-@ headed people .

a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in expanding public access to the internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of Arab blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ que &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who were themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bash@@ ar &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we turn to Bass@@ el &apos;s oeu@@ vre as a pioneer of the open web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations that have been in use for his release in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the organisation of Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly disappeared by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published under a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; following the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man told that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China still receives calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release him or to allow him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the harsh treatment of the pair in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations , United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union ( European Union )
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also urged China to release Li@@ us as she announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to abol@@ ish all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they should be able to meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it helps him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy requested the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the US Embassy sum@@ mon@@ ed an angry response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that it can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had big concerns about whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide adequate health care to Li@@ u and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um says further :
Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights reserved to the exercise of these rights .
France in France
in a statement on 29 June , China urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that no further information could be found if France would finally accept it .
Taiwan in Taiwan
the Council of fixed land@@ ings in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who advoc@@ ate peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 at Li@@ u and indicated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Doma@@ ine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he ob@@ serves that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded as vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons imposed by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in view of that , he inevitably seemed un@@ democratic .
he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the topic , the good old Lei@@ er comes up from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , because it fits better to their power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he questioned related questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to show his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided that he was paid highly in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire title of the conference so that the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam could be better understood , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no land , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , who makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ integrates the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Herr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beli@@ ve a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian advoc@@ ate ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapur do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who needs to pay back our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country , or the inhabitants of a city ?
, the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many Singap@@ or@@ ans ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc. but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
your answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with which rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world are exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question I asked most in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my clari@@ fication then follows the standard answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans probably cook in rage when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Canadi@@ ans are different from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we evi@@ dently say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if I would switch to Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be sp@@ iny - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open kindness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ ls Thailand &apos;s jun@@ ta
a popular pop band in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the jun@@ ta , which in 2014 took power and despite their promises to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of what regulations his girlfriend makes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly political , the music video indirectly refers to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as special as the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 Rules of Girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; change of settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army to monitor online content and to prosec@@ ute individuals who were accused of being le@@ ver@@ aged by the monarchy .
Thailand sets a strict ban against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Group ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only slowly re@@ covers in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Catal@@ ans , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and har@@ es live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
during the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people after scar@@ cely over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still house one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where it is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and van@@ ishes .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dj@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will forever remain in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas monthly pensions are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ asha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds herself of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia broke off simply ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ asha receives about $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband is working in the coal pit .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she says that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation ends , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children are now scre@@ aming the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , which care for im@@ purity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and golden earrings in a ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some slept outside on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys drugs that they cannot pay , and mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m that depl@@ ores the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gurt beard ) is pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip .
she declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez may be very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez is telling me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step should go .
back in the House of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , travellers are quietly consul@@ ting their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother she leaves in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair spots she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , as she puts it in a nut@@ shell .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the western part of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web purification &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app was able to identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution routes of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network .
this app with the min@@ ors &quot; filters is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable government actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while announcements about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the East and South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often subordin@@ ate extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based Media Out@@ let &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ) , which publishes cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police officers were random@@ ly checking the residents to see if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .

after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are required to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a current Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs until August 1 to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard disks , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything that matters is gone .
everything has been dis@@ b@@ anded and revealed and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both inside and outside .
one that gives honour to their name .
one that has desc@@ ended into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the earth moves on the axis of evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone by stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all quarters cov@@ eted , but my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a splendid picture that filled my expectations fully and completely .
in such a moment you are aware that you are liber@@ ating the Spirit from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you have scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear you cry al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar , or you &apos;re only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes turned to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret the word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put it in sol@@ itary and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the smell of this cursed sentence is still in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture which I was subjected to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I knew all the details exactly before I entered the room .
otherwise they probably admitted to me a larger cell .
I have to share it with only one more prisoner and may put me immediately , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell and I went back to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested method of communication : to beat with the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the complete darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen on me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled at the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance I still hear them scre@@ am &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries rang every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented to us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to protect the state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close eye view of their world@@ view .
this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I enter the inter@@ rog@@ ation room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ ver and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have used it to not answer .
I can really no longer tell when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had done nothing to deserve this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not enough to him , so they exchanged the pipe with a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a waste collector or if it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still on the line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , which is why he attacked next to an electrically loaded rod .
electricity went through my whole body , enough to supply my entire district .
my half naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say it was my only option .
a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move away , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had me released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he lo@@ aves to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( such as Far@@ mer ) .
for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and questioned its tried @-@ and @-@ tested opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed music .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , Rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that are rich in Syria from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ize with people who suffer from the disa@@ strous consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he does not openly admit it , he prev@@ ails against US foreign policy a special reluct@@ ance .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian &quot; refugees of the second generation &quot; - he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured in water dissolved Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the che@@ eks speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the cho@@ ke of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one looks at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , Jordan &apos;s Ministry of Interior has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ ai contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dep@@ u@@ ties and former press spokes@@ man of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ri@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also affir@@ m that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflecting a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan that emerges clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional gender norms by making up his vision of the fate of Arab women who have had sex before mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently low @-@ blown unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
over the past few years , the number of &apos; honour mur@@ ders &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mur@@ ders reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ated that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison for an in@@ definite period , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary for women to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that are long considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he can &apos;t separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was informed about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ a al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ ander &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself frequently :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which you , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality have been heavily cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to mem@@ ori@@ ze later that his comments were torn out of the context , twisted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b adverti@@ ses the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not dis@@ agree with Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ clear , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , did nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher association , argu@@ ing that they had vo@@ iced criticism of the problems linked to the corruption rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in succession , but the path of progress - this is how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and on artificial forms of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until it is ready , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ ke and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is presum@@ ed that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fixed cars , drums and dancing were taken over more than a thousand years ago and mar@@ ched from a time when armies from the west mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Emis@@ sions , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro G@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
for a long time I look forward to the Meg@@ uro G@@ jo@@ en : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true and a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 meter high qu@@ ad was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against scissors and straight raz@@ ors

external appearances and body care rarely were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dresser &apos;s .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , who can reproduce these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year that started in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : letter of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the revised version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel em@@ powered to accommodate affection ?
this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga by the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la dor@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their land was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part to it . after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC guer@@ ri@@ lla movement ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces Colombia ) , forming the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , before the Colum@@ bians there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , who were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock , must now re @-@ integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians had to join and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letter to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he planned to share his love with people this year , which needed the most pressing response .
so the plan arose to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19th .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had done before in order to accept the instructions of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support for people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; the student student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later told .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an assistant of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter carried me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran for me over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him fully , and set me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , tired of being the faithful companion of this warri@@ or , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything other than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices and voices
at the beginning students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state was affecting the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never found a hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw and hated as monsters , even people with beautiful feelings turned up@@ side down by their life circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter , for example , Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i :
the Colum@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ armament there would be peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people ready to take up arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will encounter many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles along our way , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months on the pursuit of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community is not just over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that dealt with the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in Ara@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt that she was a woman in reality since her childhood .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced of the sex equ@@ ation of her country@@ woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
from fear of her life , ultimately , she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; so there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove that dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the lap through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was attending a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had heard everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which cases have you been placed - in which of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for this .
when I first read his name at his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they asked me absurd demands : some said that I must prove it by running through the streets without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only bad , and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to cope with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and rescu@@ ed them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 mag .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I still can &apos;t understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering without notice , without it all .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you would be safe , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you plug . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
that was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
we don &apos;t talk about sex equ@@ ation , this is a t@@ abo@@ o .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this emotional barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to figure out how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in gun for one and a half months .
he told that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t shut up a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there wouldn &apos;t be so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Cad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there , so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately immersed in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise .
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown .
there has been nothing new about them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken along .
however , until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a bo@@ b .
I think before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gros@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
seriously in the grave !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to introduce ourselves to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately thrown us back into the stone age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ b@@ ular jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never cro@@ oked my hair .
in front of the Russian Theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they just shut their eyes in front of you because they believed they were sick ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted nor beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily wor@@ sen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I cl@@ ap@@ tured influ@@ xes .
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
this is how nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same thing as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans who have Kab@@ ard@@ iner have which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear such things .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think about transition to men who love males and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling , to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the past few months there has been a strong rise in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 stopped the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ ath , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hang@@ ed .
their stories have one thing in common : it was all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe job because of the persecution by the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gains only little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs to create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab territories into the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only led to devast@@ ation caused by drought caused by drought , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the a@@ haw@@ k you@@ ths rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general manager for co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have completed a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with resi@@ dency in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions do not pre@@ tend to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists propose an alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons license .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - are frustr@@ ated .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we generally ought to be all fem@@ inists * in general .
for example , despite equal education women still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex continues across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple beneath it .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I talk to skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black C@@ is women , on black trans@@ gender women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; raise their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , to sing my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence , which we are subjected to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold way .
or about that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men , and all men of any skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refer to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging to a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a man @-@ born and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them continue to keep silent about the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better .
although the inter @-@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself fully from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that black women define us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : recall that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life neither missed nor ignored nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published in En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in@@ significant about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again in the past 7 years - usually with a sur@@ f@@ board or in a can@@ oe - with a special concern from the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we lost when I was a kid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Water@@ keepers Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which uses and works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work lies on behavi@@ our@@ al , un@@ noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult struggle against violence

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Elec@@ tural . the article belongs to the # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ r@@ ef@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ spouse , who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put on the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena about mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez reported nothing .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her adver@@ t .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women complain at all , they generally do not receive any support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all .
content 1 pun@@ ches and statistics 2 invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that does not under@@ ni@@ mm@@ ate 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation hits and statistics
it is difficult to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher in gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a soci@@ ological research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports , which , however , do not even approach the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers are however alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 adver@@ ts went into domestic violence at the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of these were about violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 adver@@ ts for domestic violence in the peace courts . here too 86 % of women &apos;s ads came .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women claimed that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; 9 women who do not do this in Paraguay because of psychological abuse are reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year .
until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , every ten days a woman died in Paraguay because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but she still gave up . this should always be regre@@ t@@ ted .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought I would be a victim of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long with Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support one another .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case , everything started with mental mal@@ treatment .
her prosper@@ ous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started beating them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays legislation : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ olo@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # 1 ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os Movement are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ l is to declare a stand @-@ alone criminal record and to punish tough@@ er as is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legislative text was changed in some respects to attract the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law , which feared that the path for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years in prison .
the original bill had intended to pay the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence themselves have to bear , if they just want to submit an ad and wish to receive a secure accommodation , to impose the state .
Ech@@ olo@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for this :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relations .
there must be a re@@ thinking that violence is no longer seen as something normal .
whoever is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators get away offen@@ sively .
we have to report so long ad until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman suspended a year after a newspaper ban
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been suspended due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Libyan authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he is serving a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial .
Oman was governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had set off his father , Sa@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , besides his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Colonel Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sul@@ t@@ ans reign is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially inland sec@@ rec@@ y , to limit civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , and torture and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to the freedom of the press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested , after an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands to justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the board of editorial board , was charged by the Special Department and arrested by the security forces at his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS was appointed deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , was banned from August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , to distur@@ b public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison sentences and fin@@ es amoun@@ ting to 3,000 US dollars each ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a security deposit of 5000 om@@ ani ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was set and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ oun@@ cement of the judgment .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison , where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to return , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again opposed the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was injured in Oman in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of printing on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the authorities :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather peace , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or even mentioned at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the global healthcare system , covering the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists helps build own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just when the AIDS epide@@ mic had first serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I am also currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be recipients instead of being M@@ acher himself .
the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
CC : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic education , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that publishes articles only available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ Gor@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was set limits only by his own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many types of salad he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
the patents are not only valid for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more of these patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or car@@ rot varieties . based on this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate advoc@@ ate of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mor@@ ton still breeds salad , but he needs longer since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like lying in a river a b@@ oul@@ der around which I have to bud@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far too far .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features have already been patented . &quot; he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants .
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is growing in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station have bred and eaten red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the Out@@ red@@ Gor@@ geous variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is not by chance that this name sounds as if the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , so that they can be used permanently for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed grown by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds , to breed it , and not to cut off immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the Emer@@ itus Professor at University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in larger contexts , such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seeds , &quot; he says , and takes on the ever @-@ increasing mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , which is threatened in August and September 2016 . &quot; whoever wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others , in contrast to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is com@@ promised , as the available gene pool shr@@ inks constantly due to the increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all anti@@ trust features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it impossible for plant breeders to be at all difficult or difficult to use .
for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are grown in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves up to those that thri@@ ve in certain environments and resist threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is far more necessary than ever since changing conditions are far worse due to climate change .
in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property protects other breeders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan which everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
in other words , such protection is not inhibit@@ ing innovations , but fo@@ sters them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed crops adapted to changing environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to facilitate their work with farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the U.S. state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; if you breed a variety , you also breed its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , whose cultivation requires mass her@@ bi@@ cides , is breeding into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such who move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) have patents , most of the smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the experiment or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding the plant pat@@ ent@@ age : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors will sell my grades for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you have been protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it very simple to me . &quot; worldwide Reson@@ ance
although the US seems to be a leader in &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly across the globe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . this refers to the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , owners of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems which will be scheduled to drop the official start next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . therein , it represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange it and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a link from the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ab@@ ides in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law to reveal the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ H@@ RI affir@@ ms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not yield . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network due to alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of website closures to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher , Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles which he writes for non @-@ accessible websites and media for Egypt .
now the blog he established to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government was even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider at which Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , is on the other hand accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government and reflected what it means for him :
blocking blo@@ gs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi &apos;s priority ; and even though the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege ; arrest , attempted murder , pr@@ un@@ ing at the National Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) They proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
at first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now that they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 web pages from 24th May to 6th August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
besides , af@@ te documented the blocking of suppliers , through the circum@@ ference of internet cens@@ orship and private browsing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the locking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users may have access .
in addition , the situation is wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can act in court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in all Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ way to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for detailed reporting of violence in Rio , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on August 16 published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper thus explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to cry : this is not normal !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative so that we as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision is not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ cs in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise the atro@@ cities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ acent neg@@ lect of public service .
in memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the murder rate per state , Rio is at number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is one of the largest media companies in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police setup and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline in violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under fire after several reports on har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - the designation &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also leads to serious consequences for human beings .
this requires the state to use means and ways typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
it is now a week that the police inv@@ aded the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : learning besi@@ eg@@ ed Syrians to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from bru@@ te siege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where chemical weapons attack on August 21 , 2013 , demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the Assad regime was committed .
since 2013 , these areas have been besi@@ eg@@ ed by rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus , which led to local or tunnels and control points to rely on smu@@ g@@ gled food .
due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics will teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as to plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years it has been fighting to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publicity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do is taking advantage in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la for Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started producing mushrooms from the regions before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have created a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , mushrooms have been distributed free of charge throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom breeding for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to produce new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , who are bound to their homes .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days .
fires were also registered in Gali@@ cia in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite recordings , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017
some images shared by Twitter users :

numerous videos spread on the net and show pictures that allow better insights into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ eig@@ al of the Bund der farmers of Portugal explained the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened again as in June , as the streets were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the commun@@ es which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity from case to case , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val goes on in the same article of the P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread further and forth , like in a vi@@ cious circle .
in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , as inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it used fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt &apos;s own civilian protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and , on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , was so crucial that the servers did not resist the rush of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million requests .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Tali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say it like that at that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break open .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Tali@@ ban , well known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af recovered in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . his work was difficult and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wage and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged bags with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself to earn his living .
at that time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; recalls A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site we worked on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were no services and no heating there . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years he left his life without documents in Iran and prepared for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and was str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high quot@@ as . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special admission centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre , if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum seek@@ er .
until then , people who do not have money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it turned out to be A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ brid@@ led attitude of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast @-@ food .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pa@@ dua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets range far beyond the Italian catering trade and retail outlets and aim at the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I am planning a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and cann@@ ing techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen report : bill &apos;s draft bill makes it possible to shut down social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days .
he reported on the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that suggests that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency .
users would have to register to use the social networks within six months of the legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
anyone who neg@@ lect this step may be sentenced to up to six months &quot; imprisonment or the execution of a penalty .
the law , which was applied by sixty parliam@@ ent@@ arians , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another MP submitted a legislative proposal in May to introduce tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of president or senior officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law proposal , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he trained Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who had led to the removal of elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in custody on a trial date .
recently his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , apparent burden of inter alia weapon property , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iz@@ a acqu@@ itted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ ains , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists inter@@ rog@@ ated to le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly inter@@ rog@@ ated by the President of the Republic , which , according to the plan , expressly supports a controversial bill of legislation which would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused Official am@@ nesty , provided they return all un@@ lawful funds .
the document published on the Na@@ wa@@ at website on April 21 , sheds light on the appearance of the Pres@@ idential plans to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media to present their ID ?
according to new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
in the rules , it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved . it is unclear to date how the authorities will apply these provisions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selective in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; do we then see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of information distribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the provincial government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this term is part of a 2014 Act , thanks to which the Russian government conduc@@ ts a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . the law also allows the government to make use of said services for the removal of content and force it upon request to susp@@ end user data .
these web pages include websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ class@@ es.@@ h@@ k ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as ban in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; source of information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that collabor@@ ates with groups to establish a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , besides , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
UK can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing around
after this week of le@@ aked documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that Internet service providers would force to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor @-@ programs that encryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services concerning the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation runs until May 19 . responses and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
