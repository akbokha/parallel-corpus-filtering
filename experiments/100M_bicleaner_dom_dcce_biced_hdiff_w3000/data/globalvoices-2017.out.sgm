<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he walks with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops his mind behind the mountain as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the Republican pre-election was the highest number that a nominee nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not harmonize Trump and his voters with the people I got to know in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, who receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trump didn't agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggles for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump paved his way to the nominees republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people have voted for trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it's unfair to call the platters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, have voted for trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commenting on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (CWC.: as much as "White against all other ethnicities"; pun-play from white in allusion to the white and whiplash, which means so much like skidal trauma), as the big Van Jones called, has killed exactly what America has made so magnificent.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says himself, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the choice of Donald Trump, a huge part of the White Americas is giving up this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "" "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." "" "36 hours later he was corrected." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trump Land now, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican Music School of Vicente Guerrero Municipality in Oaxaca province have in common with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds apart from nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now La banda de MÃºsica (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The commune, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered a rare hope for the youth.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come and play with shiny eyes and play in the hustle and bustle you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest landfill site in Paraguays's capital - are based on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments consisting of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateurura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion all produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of restructured material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world produces about one billion tons of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonics follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of rubbish-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already had illegal fishing in the liberianic waters before it picked up the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were therefore upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind in their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give it a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to" "", "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior member of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing.</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, who then expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information and join each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is by definition unregulated: what is caught is hidden, causing it to be extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are today in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses for example, news of suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attentively pursues the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas - such as those who suggest that a ship loads his captured fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In an ideal case, such examinations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the road and, eventually, whether they have a penal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile financially." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultancy firm advocating the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supporting FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which the eight members of the network HISH-i lose every year because of the illegal fishermen who invade in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries that attract the region's commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other things, actions include sailing under false flag, bogus license papers, specifying fantasy names, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they specifically exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-seamless organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship was illegally fishing and a country could say" "" "You can't run my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "" "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Up to now the closed front operates.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks that spread fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information about illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "said Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that is intended to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships they like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping build a system that connects different information levels with each other. FISH-i is supposed to help identify criminal vessels with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence that without a doubt the global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world using the position of each trackable vessel.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "getting together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who's doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously had been fishing without a license and had hardly had to face consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board towing nets which were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries joined the West Africa Task Force in 2015. they are now combating illegal fishing, after exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With security, the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recent member country Somalia was able to announce its first major triumph: in October, it presented Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only the ship was on the way without a license and were used towing nets which are now forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship had also penetrated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing," "" "said Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works across the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the inauguration, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into void, when they assembled on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the refunds of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andenregions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the centrally located Bundestaat Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is constantly worsening, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelan by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but eventually the secrecy of a re-election of the official authorities was blocked.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, contributors to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government resolution as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or shortly MUD (approximately: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called on the demonstrators to join the elections of 2015 to the majority of representatives of the opposition.</seg>

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take part in the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation back then I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not realize that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerist. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who was accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who, over the years, recognized the magnitude of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose for himself a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went into the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">They called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and called me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Just watch that they don't kidnap you one day and I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Workers "Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the base of the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lump of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were stopped and stopped me with a guard post.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sat inside and saw a couch where men were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a camp bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been captivated there.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>

<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to invade a house and steal everything in it.</seg>

<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me of being a co-conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can put me on the burden of what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why their corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families to whom they could hand over their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The enforced disappearance of the body is the last abominable act that one can do to a human being.</seg>

<seg id="350">Editing the original portrait by Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which is published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could there be such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that elderly people felt offended by insufficient correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, French native speakers should translate from English into French - not English into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue, who could make translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, cost-searching, or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can make translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and mysterious propositions resulting from machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling imprints that often decorate shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo courtesy of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery or at least harmless. however, by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, more accurate translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censorship actions on the internet and television take</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they would not have access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also contributed footage of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups who oppose the NicolÃ¡s Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and delegated the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was appalled and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are closed again.</seg>
<seg id="399">That is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant since 2014 when reporting about protests. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission regarded this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">I have signed up again at @ vivoplaynet without cable TV and informative national TV channels.</seg>
<seg id="403">It's amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online transmitters. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, has shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server will respond incorrectly or refuse the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third blocked channel, was suspended on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who transferred the protests in Caracas, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections, making it more difficult for the Venezuelans to access multi-media coverage of current events in the country.</seg>
<seg id="412">In Paraguay, many girls become slaves to get a training</seg>
<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a Criadita as a child. now she visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today Tina fights for the rights of children and gathers testimonies from other Criaditas who have been victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="415">Photo by Cecilia Rojas. use with kind permission of structural.</seg>
<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a curtural report published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools") edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she could not eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation from the university she returned to the house again and heard the owner of the house proudly speaking about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she said," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, there are more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money gives her underage son or her underage daughter to another, more mature family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children will have to perform countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this in the context of a treaty that one cannot abolish.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated by the Criaditas is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family who has their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" can be handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and justifies their exploitation with faith that they give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education and perhaps even starve.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret of Paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to the hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of violent beatings. shortly after she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military doctor TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an official at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital of AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira had a stick on MarÃ­n until it suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were responsible for the practice of Criadazgo, deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">"" "several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and called for" "" "no more Carolina" "" "to be deployed in Paraguay." ""</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"" "" "" "more cows are registered in Paraguay than children," "" "complained Tina Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to infringe the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The couple's neighbors and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a quick investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case occurs in court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n might be indicative - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Criadazgo in court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as labour, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to declare bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work and began to sell candy on the street or in the market to make money.</seg>

<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital of AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up against five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but did not get unlimited food either. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizant of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings the owner of the house Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and to read editorial papers like "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to persuade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he thought she was intelligent, but did not talk to her." "" "the host found someone who listened while he talked about politics," "" "she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="473">Her Lord feared that she would lose the education that she had made possible to lose again, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">It was quite clear, however, that she had paid for everything that she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Even at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never spoken of is mobbing and the harassment exposed to Criaditas when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody to my home. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I was not part of a group.</seg>

<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make the registration. it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shizugawa High School in Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on March 11, 2011 and still the region is occupied with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeast Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the Prefecture of Miyagi was a total prefecture in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami resulting from it.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring Countess Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Still, the Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, already alone that's why 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view which progress was achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (decomposed, decomposed, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the greatest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelfsacessences (debris, canyetsu juutaku) would be relocated to final spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold disaster, nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in comfort shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, more than 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated homes were moved to final homes after the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune have opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of Iwate and Miyagi fishing harbours are in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have affected agricultural land in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of land-destroyed farmland of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has been recovering as far as possible, but Fukushima still remains behind.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 per cent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show up to 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn a living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous interviews among the local population and among the evacuated ones. she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feeling changed against the tsunami-risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents found that there was still not enough work in catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition commemorating the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the location of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness to the worst, disastrous, nuclear accident that Japan had ever experienced.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">More than 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture after 2017.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuations in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across people from other countries who speak another language, the differences seem to be greater than common ground.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often notices that one connects more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Violeta Camarasa recalls how the love of music overcame her affection for the Iranian culture; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">Local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>

<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s announced that Sampaio was suspended from active service until the investigation of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers how he strikes in GoiÃ¢nia with his stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landing on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Deseuralizador," a press channel by media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, shared the video filmed by Luiz da Luz on the net in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics shortly thereafter rush to him.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The municipality Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It has been two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the decline, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and swaddling daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are in operation because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Needless to say that in MaÃ±alich I would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">A few decades ago, the news would have been a subject of concern for the country, but the bad harvests are no more news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry eliminated?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the community saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and they were hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the present production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate ca. 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will go into history with certainty," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the decommissioning of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about closing the factory, is the word that he repeats most," "" "scam." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those questioned are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first Jubilee, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially written documents which differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was delayed and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">"" "Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the discontinued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters." "" "the country had no money for the sugar cane mills still in operation," "" "he assures." ""</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with issues that are important to them. they do it through hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will make it possible for the young participants to engage in talks such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance" or whatever it makes sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway der tears," a road section in Western Canada where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people didn't always command the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as is a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I am trying to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take away our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that one day we will lift ourselves up</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and move forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they determined the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru ("" "" "" "plastic models of dishes" "" ") of any food served in this restaurant." ""</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers watch these plastic dishes and then decide whether they can enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokioter district of Kappabashi, there are a multitude of these small companies producing plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into striking cell phone accessories and other gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new plastic decorated cell phone bands as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some Handy-Stand and Handy-Designer allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there is someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and hand-held tapes of dried salmon.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed are regularly appearing only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, Chief of the Sinaloa Cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of innumerable parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico called the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drugs trafficking"), telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I get past newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the composure.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified with the fact that they were" "" "respectable" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies, if they do not touch and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family was sacked with threats." in this she describes how armed criminals squeezed money out of their business month by month, until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are away from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested because they don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked if tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation signed by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was already past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Citizens Council for Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office had 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico created the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But what about the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been misled to depict tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank wagon crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kicked around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes, which were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses enveloped including a movie theater nearby, which was full of people watching the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to inconvenience.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture entitled" "" "This is Nigeria." "" "from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident form the gruesome scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But this is not the end of history.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been tipped several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real, but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">Reports were reported, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one left behind to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be depicted figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The attack was also unresolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the DR Congo image is only one in a series of misnominations; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Further, personal comments such as this example falsely affect the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture taken from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning report published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee could strike, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news page falsely claiming that President Burma's Thein has said that monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image of DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, accessed last on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations that called AFP as their source also falsely attributed their testimony to Thein, but had not related the picture from the DR Congo.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killings of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is important both. it is therefore worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">This mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and does it diminish the horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal equals to acknowledge the tragedy. sometimes these images are even asked by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images of readers and spectators are desensitizing and taking the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how forcible media act to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with violent portrayals in the news media, fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used by the context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each investigation of false attributions should also take into account how internationally they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons used according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. irreplaceable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (e.g. Spanish Sobreiesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone stubbornly resist any attempt to make a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression does not suffice, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist chose "untranslatable" Steven Bird to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the VAT clap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - weep for your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or laziness that one feels after being warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you affect how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of Treasure Languages, highly appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favourite nouns here.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They were demoralizing me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim in a variety of ways. but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognize that if French, Muslim women are prevented from carrying their headscarf in public buildings and Saudi-Arab, Muslim women by their government will be forced to cover their entire body that these are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to connect here and now despite a language barrier with someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been hosting events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project, the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to it is often associated with understanding," "" "these events will instead" "" "listen in order to appreciate, feel, touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain their story in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and their representation lead to the fact that the audience is involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call out laughing and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusingly tells the tale of the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fabel, John Nyamamara is asked: "how is this to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. anyone inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling tours.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of retesting the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started in the Vatican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (civil front for the neural examination of debts) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-establishment of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"" "" "" "the people of Puerto Rico require that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debt will be held responsible for their corruption." ""</seg>

<seg id="1161">We are pressed and oppressed.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a researcher of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is available royalty-free contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side-by-side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet-volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have not received any information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective reminder gives his friends and his family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, and instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process from time to time extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, was transferred to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel" had taken part in Adra as the "strictly secret" command of the military tribunal from his cell. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his place of residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologists and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes were more prescient than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the world's most important archaeological sites, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would make everything possible to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a prosabre, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available for licence-free.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: Director after release due to corruption again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique reacted with anger on a corruption attack by which a member of the government returned to the state machine after half of his sentence against corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This was Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants due to the embezzlement of 54 million Metikal (some 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from Mozambique's airports, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the motion, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to get back to his old position, as the company had no disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents do not welcome the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note of is that even the company should have initiated disciplinary proceedings against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company seemed to be silent, however, and made no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the social media of Mozambique, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "disguised":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which has been served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Unquestionably!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, a young Mozambique student and a student of political science in Brazil, says the director does not have any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he abuses him, I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">"" "" "" "Cambaza lacks the moral to return and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served by the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel will not only remember the Mozambique as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he vigorously confirmed that "an ambitious man was able to all, also to sell the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that he doesn't. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took its posts from the net because it contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely diminishing connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for its use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several Burmese words with different meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spider bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboofutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail from one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression very much, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before deleting all posts suspected of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you are writing on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words next.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech get quite a good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who is spreading hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to extinguish his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from publishing, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the mail "did not meet the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their views against hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author informed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it doesn't work like that.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "peas curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsily deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun of Facebook and deliberately writing the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads: "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post states" "" "If you are a doctor, heal people then?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to control the proliferating hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at the context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learn from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">In May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organisation (IRO), a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, because age does not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children Rights, the minors as" "" "defined every person under 18 years of age." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">UN statistics for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married between 1997 and 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements endeavoring to abolish laws on children's marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children, they should, damn't worry about their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tension in this actually uncomplicated case, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">Yet at the beginning of 2017, the draft bill against the children's marriage was decided - despite four Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and not a single one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">"" "" "" "the majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws on children's marriage were finally amended." ""</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a minister of the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that concealed the core of the thing, but do you know what? the children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson thought that it took a long time to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage network has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group which spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age of marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is now 18 years independent of religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The proposal to amend the marriage network was decided today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present during the voting.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All deputies who were opposed have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's marriage is legally no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childbearing shield abuse.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who fought it.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj has announced his intention to take court steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to dissolve his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney General, Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said that it was quite legitimate if Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users desired that the debate on the subject would go differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, instead of keeping the discussion so general, instead of talking about the problem that we, instead of talking about the problem, would simply say that the state that protects our daughters from being abused by large, hard-boiled men that are in advantage to them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it's not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or still the norm, even though there are laws that prohibit it.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright Law in the United States, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and popular Encyclopedia on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use bypass tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been taking place since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirror sites (sites that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. host computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After hearing the news (about the locking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents on a distributed and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorseite from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites if locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member as well as staff at Mozilla im Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server will forward the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is carried out by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A heatable rhinoceros, chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed paints.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to take a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested when Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) suddenly called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the river Rapti.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard was, and immediately I started to take pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he was already standing face to face to Tigers,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he immediately sat down, we looked at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for promoting Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to make recordings of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published once again as part of a content-sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with the greatest care must avoid the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronouns or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to the social pressure they respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the indian State of Odisha by a headlight court and violated by her family and the village community after she had mentioned a married relative with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives is also common among men. however, they have far less rebuke to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the Community of Video Volunteers and dedicated to the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawar has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as child marriage to exile of HIV and AIDS infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in its discussion was about women who didn't call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to speak out loud the name of their husbands is a custom that they all uphold and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered to be a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that up to this discussion we never thought about it.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband stayed for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does this mean that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the names of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was only hiding in front of him; another decided to release all the pent-up frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenalin rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Over the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the inox-red dot on the forehead that shows the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinced spot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped doing so, but think that they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the Discussion Club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip with each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what they hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in their life they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities have been tied to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only borne Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salad-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, the morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to go on a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the question as to whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it's not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, probably for disbelieving purposes, concerns the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently allowed to use the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is a local superstition that the head of a bald-headed man could bring gold or bring wealth, declared the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks have been registered for men in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in the South African country carried out a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight against this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1595">He warned those who would like to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to kahle men who travel to Mozambique are target ritualistic attacks, warned the Mozambique police according to the latest killings of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and killing of bald-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of MorRumbala, province of ZambÃ©zia, for probably disbelieving rituals, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last few days, three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook, Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the Bloggers poor Snaippa, indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÃCHTE GERNE EIN Mozambique, THE SME ashamed A country where people would be ashamed to offer sex against good marks, work and other achievements, a nation in which people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country where neither the albinos nor bald or bald headed for disbelieving purposes or "black magic" will be hunted.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some of the opportunities for macabre humor could not be missed.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published under a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" following the draft Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" "" "internal affair" "" "and a spokesman told that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China still receives calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release him or to allow him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the harsh treatment of the pair in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations, United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union (European Union)</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also urged China to release Lius as she announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to abolish all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should be able to meet and receive all the visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">"" "us Ambassador Terry Branstad announced that the Americans" "" "want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad, in so far as it helps him in his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy requested the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US Embassy summoned an angry response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to interfere and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing reported the news agency Reuters that China had big concerns about whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide adequate health care to Liu and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum says further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights reserved to the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France in France</seg>
<seg id="1669">In a statement on 29 June, China urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where he needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that no further information could be found if France would finally accept it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan in Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of fixed landings in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who advocate peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 at Liu and indicated that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, since Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He observes that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded as vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons imposed by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries," in view of that, he inevitably seemed undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">He defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the topic, the good old Leier comes up from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shanmugam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He questioned related questions with non-replies rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to show his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point, provided that he was paid highly in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire title of the conference so that the context of the statements of Shanmugam could be better understood, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was more a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no land," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, who makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review disintegrates the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Herr Shanmugam" "" "belive a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian advocate?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapur do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who needs to pay back our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country, or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">, the journal Journey of a Decade tends to bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many Singaporans...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "" "defense of the country" "" "etc. but that is not quite correct." ""</seg>

<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video indirectly refers to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, as special as the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 Rules of Girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision making over important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army to monitor online content and to prosecute individuals who were accused of being leveraged by the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>

<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Catalans, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together to Soviet sites in the area.</seg>

<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">During the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>

<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and golden earrings in a teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs RamÃ­rez tells, people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys drugs that they cannot pay, and massaging them with a balm that deplores the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with their daughter Merrui, who has a yogurt beard) is posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp by Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answers smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez may be very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez is telling me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the House of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travellers are quietly consulting their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair spots she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, as she puts it in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the western part of China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app named Jingwang (or "Web purification").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app was able to identify and prosecute the sources and distribution routes of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors "filters is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable government actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"" "" "" "this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region." ""</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the East and South, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often subordinate extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based Media Outlet "Images from mainland China" ("Images from mainland China"), which publishes censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police officers were randomly checking the residents to see if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, it could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "(" "" "Images from mainland China" "" ") also published a Jingwang product description, which emphasizes that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may have a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are required to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs until August 1 to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard disks, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he loaves to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to flee from their village in Palestine where they had lived as felahyees (such as Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and questioned its tried-and-tested opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, Racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that are rich in Syria from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking, and he can sympathize with people who suffer from the disastrous consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he does not openly admit it, he prevails against US foreign policy a special reluctance.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, has anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian" refugees of the second generation "- he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "said Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while he poured in water dissolved NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the cheeks speak lukewarm coffee and the choke of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when one looks at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, Jordan's Ministry of Interior has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinnai contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputies and former press spokesman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahrib said in an interview with CNN that the concert was" "" "just" "" "cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also affirm that the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflecting a more and more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan that emerges clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib regained traditional gender norms by making up his vision of the fate of Arab women who have had sex before marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently low-blown unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of 'honour murders' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary murders reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravated that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in prison for an indefinite period," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary for women to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that are long considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he can't separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was informed about politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawa al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" "" "Santander" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself frequently:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which you, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been heavily censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to memorize later that his comments were torn out of the context, twisted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a revised version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not disagree with Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuclear, who later should work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, did nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the hashemian kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, arguing that they had voiced criticism of the problems linked to the corruption rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in succession, but the path of progress - this is how Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and on artificial forms of democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is ready, Hdaib will continue to rake and therefore resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is presumed that there is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the fixed cars, drums and dancing were taken over more than a thousand years ago and marched from a time when armies from the west marched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emissions, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gjoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">For a long time I look forward to the Meguro Gjoen: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true and a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">External appearances and body care rarely were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser's.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens go into the experienced hands of hairdressers, who can reproduce these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers Batalla de Barberos, which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year that started in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the revised version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel empowered to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la dorliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their land was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part to it. after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: revolutionary Armed Forces Colombia), forming the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the Columbians there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, who were exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock, must now re-integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk to Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He planned to share his love with people this year, which needed the most pressing response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan arose to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19th.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves up as they had done before in order to accept the instructions of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support for people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between," the student student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later told.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an assistant of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter carried me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "he answered," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I am answering a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran for me over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him fully, and set me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, tired of being the faithful companion of this warrior, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything other than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning students and some leaders of the FARC came together for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state was affecting the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never found a hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw and hated as monsters, even people with beautiful feelings turned upside down by their life circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter, for example, DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Columbians were prophesied that after disarmament there would be peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people ready to take up arms, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will encounter many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles along our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone I thought would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "so there are no more men in Chechnya that can remove that disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the lap through the WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was attending a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long will you still honor the family, you stain?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had heard everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases have you been placed - in which of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name at his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked me absurd demands: some said that I must prove it by running through the streets without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to cope with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has shamed not only your family but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and rescued them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 mag.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering without notice, without it all.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you would be safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you plug. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">We don't talk about sex equation, this is a taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this emotional barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to figure out how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't shut up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "with this I mean, they probably invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so-called" "" "honour" "" "has experienced through blood satisfaction." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Cadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there, so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they would have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately immersed in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new about them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now they were not presented as bandits, there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already happened in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grosny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously in the grave!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to introduce ourselves to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately thrown us back into the stone age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never crooked my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means" "" "Don't worry about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>

<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never insulted me, never hunted nor beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic steadily worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I claptured influxes.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is how nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same thing as Chechens who want to prophesy with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans who have Kabardiner have which, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear such things.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about transition to men who love males and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of feeling, to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the past few months there has been a strong rise in suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 stopped the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahraz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniath, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: it was all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe job because of the persecution by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gains only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi Arabs to create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams that divert water from the Arab territories into the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to devastation caused by drought caused by drought, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the ahawk youths rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general manager for co-operation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have completed a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy" "" "aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residency in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not pretend to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi and be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists propose an alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - are frustrated.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we generally ought to be all feminists * in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite equal education women still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex continues across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple beneath it.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I talk to skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, on black transgender women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But all agree that women - all women - should come together to "raise their voices and" Kumbaya, to sing my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racist violence, which we are subjected to black women in a twofold way.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men, and all men of any skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refer to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, Sojourner complained," "" "Am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a man-born and marginalized being in historical terms." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them continue to keep silent about the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the inter-sectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from the white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself fully from feminism and to join the movement of the Womanism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that black women define us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: recall that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life neither missed nor ignored nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner, Ada BÃ¡ez, said that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-spouse, who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put on the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena about mistreatment, the Ada BÃ¡ez reported nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her advert.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women complain at all, they generally do not receive any support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 punches and statistics 2 invisible mistreatments and a legal system that does not undernimmate 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation hits and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher in gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a sociological research institution in Paraguay. "there are various indications and reports, which, however, do not even approach the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 adverts went into domestic violence at the District Attorney Office. 70% of these were about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 adverts for domestic violence in the peace courts. here too 86% of women's ads came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women claimed that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "9 women who do not do this in Paraguay because of psychological abuse are reported.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse," "" "she declared at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to her estimates, every ten days a woman died in Paraguay because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but she still gave up. this should always be regretted.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">"" "" "" "I never thought I would be a victim of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happened to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen so long with Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner abused her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network" "" "Yo te Creo" "" "(" "" "I believe you" "" "), which consists of women who are all victims of abuse." ""</seg>

<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echolori, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# 1).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos Movement are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that Femizil is to declare a stand-alone criminal record and to punish tougher as is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislative text was changed in some respects to attract the deputies for the law, which feared that the path for decriminalisation of abortions, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to pay the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence themselves have to bear, if they just want to submit an ad and wish to receive a secure accommodation, to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echolori argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for this:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as a part of interpersonal relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">There must be a rethinking that violence is no longer seen as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators get away offensively.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to report so long ad until maltreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been changed, including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or even mentioned at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the global healthcare system, covering the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists helps build own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just when the AIDS epidemic had first serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I am also currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always be recipients instead of being Macher himself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here, as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">CC: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic education, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that publishes articles only available for payment (the so-called" "" "Paywall" "" ") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as OutredGorgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was set limits only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many types of salad he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only valid for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, special red or green or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more of these patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or carrot varieties. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate advocate of a millennia-old tradition Morton still breeds salad, but he needs longer since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is like lying in a river a boulder around which I have to buddy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features have already been patented. "he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing in the USA and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station have bred and eaten red RÃ¶mersalat of the OutredGorgeous variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not by chance that this name sounds as if the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"" "the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds) is inspired by the movement for free" "" "open source" "" "software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software." ""</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, so that they can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seed grown by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds, to breed it, and not to cut off immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in larger contexts, such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seeds," he says, and takes on the ever-increasing mergers in the global agriculture industry, which is threatened in August and September 2016. "whoever wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others, in contrast to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is compromised, as the available gene pool shrinks constantly due to the increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all antitrust features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it impossible for plant breeders to be at all difficult or difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves up to those that thrive in certain environments and resist threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is far more necessary than ever since changing conditions are far worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property protects other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan which everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">In other words, such protection is not inhibiting innovations, but fosters them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed crops adapted to changing environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to facilitate their work with farmers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all, Morton is interfering with the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we do not really create the features ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "if you breed a variety, you also breed its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, whose cultivation requires mass herbicides, is breeding into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such who move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) have patents, most of the smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the experiment or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding the plant patentage: "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors will sell my grades for a few years, "he says." with a patent you have been protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it very simple to me. "worldwide Resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in "open source" breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly across the globe.</seg>
<seg id="2684">"" "in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" "" "Centre for Sustainable Agriculture" "" "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements."

<seg id="2686">"" "the German organisation Agrecol is working on an" "" "open source" "" "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot be easily taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. this refers to the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, owners of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"" "Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's" "" "Open Source" "" "seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a global alliance for" Open Source "seed systems which will be scheduled to drop the official start next year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2692">An association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others. therein, it represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange it and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a link from the Luby of Ossi hopes that more people will soon see it.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly paid attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," "" "says Luby." "" "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information abides in spite of this attack and the mocking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law to reveal the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as it is now. ANHRI affirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not yield. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network due to alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of website closures to the victim. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher, Ahmed Gamal Ziada, has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles which he writes for non-accessible websites and media for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he established to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government was even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider at which Ziadas blog is given a home, is on the other hand accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government and reflected what it means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking blogs is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi's priority; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege; arrest, attempted murder, pruning at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">At first I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now that they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 web pages from 24th May to 6th August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Besides, afte documented the blocking of suppliers, through the circumference of internet censorship and private browsing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the locking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users may have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation is worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can act in court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army deployed in the favelas in NiterÃ³i, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in all Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airway to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "for detailed reporting of violence in Rio, the newspaper" Extra "" "" on August 16 published the editorial "" "" This is not normal "" "" in which it announced to set up a new section called "" "" War in Rio. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper thus explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to cry: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">"" "" "" "this is the only alternative so that we as journalists don't close our eyes to cruelty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision is not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrics in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise the atrocities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war" is arguing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando FrazÃ£o / AgÃªncia Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">"" "according to CecÃ­lia Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" "" "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most up-to-date available data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murder rate per state, Rio is at number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In particular, Globo, the largest media company in South America, is one of the largest media companies in South America, which, like CecÃ­lia, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police setup and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline in violent deaths. for some years, the UPP has been increasingly under fire after several reports on harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - the designation "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also leads to serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways typical of war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week that the police invaded the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brute siege and blockages, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region, where chemical weapons attack on August 21, 2013, demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the Assad regime was committed.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these areas have been besieged by rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus, which led to local or tunnels and control points to rely on smuggled food.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics will teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas to plant their own mushrooms as "life saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and run the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that for three years it has been fighting to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more" "" "publicity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, the humanitarian Crowdfunding platform CanDo is taking advantage in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila for Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to Cando until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started producing mushrooms from the regions before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this was done, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have created a" "" "educational farm for the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, mushrooms have been distributed free of charge throughout East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on October 21 in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in Galicia in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite recordings, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2845">The aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Sovereigal of the Bund der farmers of Portugal explained the paper PÃºblico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After PedrÃ³gÃ£o roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the communes which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>

""</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily inflammable wood, like in a vicious circle, spread further and forth, like in a vicious circle.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16, as inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it used fogos.pt's own civilian protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and, on this fateful weekend in October, was so crucial that the servers did not resist the rush of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site counted more than half a million requests.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the fall of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups who had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother didn't say it like that at that time, she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy should break open.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the smugglers.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt suddenly defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, well known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf recovered in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. his work was difficult and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wage and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged bags with mortars that were heavier than himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," recalls Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site we worked on.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"" "there were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years he left his life without documents in Iran and prepared for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and was stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time ago Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high quotas. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes," "" "the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special admission centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre, if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum seeker.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who do not have money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it turned out to be Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbridled attitude of life helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast-food.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans operated companies, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp restaurant in Padua; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs targets range far beyond the Italian catering trade and retail outlets and aim at the country that he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and canning techniques." "" "so they can sell their crop surplus on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end there are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the evacuation of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen-Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that suggests that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use the social networks within six months of the legislative decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Anyone who neglect this step may be sentenced to up to six months "imprisonment or the execution of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty parliamentarians, is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "another MP submitted a legislative proposal in May to introduce tougher penalties for the insult of president or senior officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the insult of the President and state institutions is already punishable. however, under the law proposal, such a deed would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he trained Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who had led to the removal of elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, as more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in custody on a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison management according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, apparent burden of inter alia weapon property, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza acquitted the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakains, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists interrogated to leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated by the President of the Republic, which, according to the plan, expressly supports a controversial bill of legislation which would guarantee businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption accused Official amnesty, provided they return all unlawful funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the Nawaat website on April 21, sheds light on the appearance of the Presidential plans to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the nomination of his sources, stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media to present their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the rules, it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be achieved. it is unclear to date how the authorities will apply these provisions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selective in order to protect citizen journalism and independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "do we then see ourselves in" "" "WeChat" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register as an" "" "organizer of information distribution" "" "in the provincial government." ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This term is part of a 2014 Act, thanks to which the Russian government conducts a list of online services that organize the publication of the information. the law also allows the government to make use of said services for the removal of content and force it upon request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages include websites such as Vcontacts and Odnoclasses.hk (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the Wikipedias ban in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English-language articles, the data, Turkey support the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it was an" "" "source of information" "" "that collaborates with groups to establish a political diffusion campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is, besides, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">UK can't stop sniffing around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week of leaked documents, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that Internet service providers would force to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor-programs that encrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services concerning the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation runs until May 19. responses and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
