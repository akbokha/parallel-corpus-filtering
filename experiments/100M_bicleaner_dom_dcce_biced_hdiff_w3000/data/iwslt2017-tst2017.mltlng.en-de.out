this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA had heard illegal phones from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA transferred Iran literally blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not like ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government fought against Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this train he became a symbol of the pattern of the government to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous that they reveal .
so when the government le@@ aned at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters had done before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en was living with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they have been saying for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped on Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can always hide .
instead of failure and ris@@ ing to make statements , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his agreement , bought his telephone cards secret ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit meeting , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more condemned than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower left to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitution , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone .
but just like the government &apos;s technology to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources .
they can do so from the moment they contact , instead of hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist when Ris@@ en wrote his book and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server for which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot obtain more information cover@@ t , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us that not only technology experts like Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental contribut@@ or who raises the alarm to the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
at least these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data leak of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages how the whole system works as it works .
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box offices in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a trace of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend from childhood days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next unveiled documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent rocker or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and the powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
in the whole world media and leading politicians , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of a few , are being used to hide and veil their fortun@@ es -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there were so far no prominent Americans in this Dis@@ closure , that sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but thanks to the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states you need less information , you need less information to start a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
fraud allows sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made suggestions to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to regard this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very comfor@@ ting as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if it always will be the rich and the powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that something has begun to change .
over the past few years , we have seen a lot more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has entered into central registers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseu@@ do companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story that I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after finishing my design studies , I made a stop shop .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to get kidn@@ apped in a Maz@@ das boot !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what caused me there ?
a stranger is sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , slept on to@@ e tips at the door , and my bedroom door shut .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the artwork he bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
maybe the people who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me .
let &apos;s make a time leap , two years later ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate goes out and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something for it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed up .
had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent ?
things came into the roll .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ u czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it .
so we presented the Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room you close when visiting .
through the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the rocket to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you are contempl@@ ating the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting side .
this quiet flight of panic you can now feel -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
thus , most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who &apos;s got Al Gor@@ es mobile now ?
could you please announce to Twitter that he is candidates for the post of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he came from , how to call his dog or his children ?
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone ?
this is because a well thought @-@ out feedback system will strengthen trust .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had handed over their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how prob@@ able it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are about age and place of residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation ev@@ okes com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you talk too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; talk too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there &apos;s an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Nice works of art in your home ! I &apos;m making a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can it be created with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which themes you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not reck@@ on was the large amount of people who were more than willing to reject these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need that had not been met before .
for us the business is very good .
of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated flats .
hosts have invited guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately , of the 123 million overnight stays , only a fraction of the problem was a problem .
for men trust one another .
if trust works , it can result in wonderful things .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you go to the hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring about books .
you can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled across this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions go together ?
it is a matter of economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people are part of themselves openly , and that changes everything .
it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visited , a group there would be waiting for you to fill up a thoroughly and show you one at a ta@@ vern tour of which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn to cook a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments for the sake of sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of joint participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relations instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places belonging to the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children had gone out . incub@@ ator programs were started ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was already available before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives me past me .
of course we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay when che@@ ating at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
one study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab my head cover .
my feminist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , as opposed to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not only accepted the faith of my parents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have strug@@ gled with the Koran .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was tru@@ sting and slow devotion , which deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that somebody perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptian , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock turned rapidly into revol@@ t .
why should one do something like that ?
I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... near@@ er ancest@@ ry ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country that has been attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others transformed me from a civi@@ c into a suspect .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the United States to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I drove -- as we drove -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not mo@@ dest@@ y yourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were waiting : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were considered to be Muslims , dra@@ gged and killed in the open .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually say people say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , hel@@ pers and Olympic athletes .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
it might be a couple of parking lots , but don &apos;t stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant look at people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington DC area , DC recently : people are actually not being radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are ra@@ dic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radi@@ cal@@ isation , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even by their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to be terrorists the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when one looks at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m established the connection with God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive way of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we tend to accept an author@@ itarian system of government , con@@ formance , and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that if you submit messages that have been adver@@ sely reported about Muslims , they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries and the pr@@ un@@ ing of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
when you see when the mood against Muslims f@@ lowed upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two periods of time .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
when it comes to the allocation of collective debt , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has grown from my brother such a skilled young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can ex@@ ert our religion freely .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we ro@@ de sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come , not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had given courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps say that you hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with a drau@@ ght , working in a cl@@ assy think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
looking at Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people appear as an exception to a rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air pack@@ et production penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
through inter@@ locking , air@@ planes achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be known collectively , where the mobile objects are located in space .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device trying to hit two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star @-@ runners it can float , and therefore has big advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in which location the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practi@@ sing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often ask about basic abstract questions which are at the heart of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known for example as machines with a thousand moving parts , which meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft , which only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it only has a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no flap , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starter . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right when all of you watch is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is quite symmet@@ rical .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
in this way he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions no matter what direction it is turned or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some is conceivable in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller drops , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , albeit restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to re@@ think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lamp par@@ ach@@ ute on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and the act of creation .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
about 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , so the mass of three suns changed into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment , they lighted more brigh@@ tly than all the stars along in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in the first place .
1.3 billion years ago , it was just a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing by us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , that are about through col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of lig@@ o increased significantly , which improved the recognition capacity enormously .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was started for a final test run to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes rush@@ ed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
the fruits of my life were basically the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has studied gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of black holes and her by observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals for 23 years . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is an eff@@ usion in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers often perform a really sil@@ ly dance in courses for rel@@ ativity theory .
&quot; stretching and st@@ ow@@ ning , stretching and st@@ ow@@ ning . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stri@@ pped when the waves were picked up . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os according to the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
with sounds this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
for example , your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by observing changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we transform wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , you can hear the same pair of p@@ ups with an additional key change . this sounds like wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu .
it is a kind of motion vocabulary , embos@@ sed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s sound &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what to hear , knows this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s talk about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , orbit a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the abi@@ ding meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a whole new way to explore the universe as never before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not .
a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is covered by his own glow .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the League of Lig@@ o , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as seen by Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the origin of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as brave as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago , I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before which I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of removing my fear .
my fear of talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a definite yes , which changed my life pro@@ found@@ ly , on an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my smallest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three unbelievable daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new life @-@ attitude in my family . from then on I s@@ wore to always play with them as soon as you invite me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things out , awaken you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am on television . I produce television .
I do television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously in production , four TV programs , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running succ@@ essively on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of those 70 TV hours are con@@ sign@@ ments that I created myself and not just produced , so still overhead . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing that ?
nobody , so I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work , so you understand that I &apos;m not just walking around the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it does not dream with a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am immersed in my work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops , as if I painted on a canvas .
as soon as you have a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and rational . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work is working well .
a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy road , I could go for it forever .
many people participate when I explain to them the bu@@ zz that I &apos;m talking over writing that writing is a joy to me .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I started to work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you cannot asp@@ ire to size differently .
the feeling of not being different than striving for great@@ ness , no matter what price .
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or perhaps it means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s genius .
perhaps it &apos;s ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the hum@@ ming . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burnt out .
the hum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swe@@ et@@ ly , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the hum@@ ming ceased .
the hum@@ ming of the engine was silent .
I did not love my work any more . the engine was off .
the sum did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same title work , 15 hours days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan is not asleep , does not give up , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a flagship Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
so what do you do if what you do is suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take away , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you are working , you love what you do , to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the hum@@ ming when you know the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sne@@ ak &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sne@@ ak &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I hate it when I &apos;m titanium and fu@@ zz my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
we play and their sisters b@@ ump , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum , I can do nothing except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is lost , or whatever the girl let loose in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity everywhere are everywhere .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming slowly comes back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the working environment , the titanium serum , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the aid of broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what is the real bu@@ zz .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz depends on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current that comes from the jo@@ ie de vi@@ vre .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a fixed rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any guilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not as easy as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person works better than to be at home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
at the same time , I mainly feel stiff , absent and confused .
I always travel to my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I wonder : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and talking to my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more is not needed .
everyone can take 15 minutes a day , even on a bad day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my fe@@ el@@ iness , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for his peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find out and store it yourself .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I be victorious . meeting friends , reading books , enjoying the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes per piece , why not treat yourself to 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum now .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the sum of work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s easy for me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , who is going to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the land I create the marathon , the I run , the troops , the screens , the high clay , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the other , the right bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life is wide in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll awaken you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
they certainly have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; cereb@@ ell@@ ar stimulation . &quot; an electrode is im@@ planted deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in emergency room .
I often nour@@ ished patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain is s@@ wollen with skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the internal pressure of the skull .
for this you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to allow cells to grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to allow cells to grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
it is necessary to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to prosp@@ er .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts Jean @-@ François managed .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly shared themselves and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they consist of 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they get us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells .
we are confronted with a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then color them in color to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we consul@@ ted them at the sampling point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ import these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ import the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we imported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor @-@ motor sector in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left side they see the monkey who got up spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not as precise and not as fast .
see now , when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the mat@@ ur@@ ation .
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority permit us to launch it soon ?
then it is necessary to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as an imm@@ utable fact .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and an impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was clearly made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my out@@ si@@ ghted friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are bl@@ amed , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ peak parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , who , however , are too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and bring income to the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 billion US dollars were invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , railway tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollar sounds a lot of money until it compar@@ es it with the 5.1 billion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing except to infl@@ ate stock prices and raise real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ tops , which are not equ@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand that , as in an endless loop , rein@@ forces the pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m of investors , who , out of fear , the prophecy of the race could come true that his son would kill him if he grows up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily causes the circumstances that cause ec@@ pus to kill him .
that is my hatred with capitalism --
his exceedingly lav@@ ish art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy as a result of these conclusions .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same mood in questions of state interests .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that g@@ lows very bright , it is burnt out quickly .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of the corporations -- was a democratic zone .
in our present @-@ day demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place , as the economy gradually under@@ min@@ ed politics and deprived them of it .
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of its DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power is mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separate .
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , that they star@@ ve at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has chann@@ elled politics so far that it itself har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality increases , the aggregate demand falls , and the directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their businesses .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by sub@@ stit@@ uting low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation lets the twin peaks become higher , the waste sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we need to resh@@ ape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and in doing so make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or to indul@@ ge in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans , &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life .
I think we should be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in brief .
in the area of enterprises : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
no distinction between those that the companies belong , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , to whom the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no elev@@ ating twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy : please introduce yourself in a nut@@ shell that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a mutual fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the 1944 Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe is simultaneously liber@@ alizing in which they preferred privileged persons , and Marxist , because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it more democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are experiencing , it will dest@@ abil@@ ise not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am perfectly fine .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t s@@ wir@@ l , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your speech , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers told you very clearly what you think about the West &apos;s view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is played -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism to democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected that this was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the constant den@@ ial that a massive fault line was going through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massive threat to the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal to reveal this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , still have chosen the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to sustain life through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may be delayed for a while , but when the changes occur , it will happen ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Harv@@ est ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not the case .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one from the Troika , who imposed this policy on us , admitted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 what it seems to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of you have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right corner of this turn .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this will be a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive where , after watching a squ@@ e@@ as@@ el , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left hand side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not care to get to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium out@@ cry , the average television -- shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon does such a thing , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch everyone for free .
and when Amazon comes out for nothing , one really attacks , right ?
millions of spectators watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who pick up everything .
you can record when to start the show , when to pause , which parts one ski@@ ps or looks at once again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands in 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always on the look@@ out to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of organizing a contest , he and his team viewed the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , i.e. the reviews they give to the shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went into a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what is going on here ?
we have two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
when data analysis does not work , it is a bit frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time when we are more and more involved in statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the multi @-@ health system here ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software . if you come into contact , you are in jail .
if someone is in jail here in the U.S. and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad type , by data analysis of Google &apos;s research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked fine , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore .
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the journal Nature .
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams increasingly into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy
over the years , I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
you have to solve a complex problem , mainly two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its individual parts , so you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and intel@@ lect where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why they wouldn &apos;t have been able otherwise . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; which wasn &apos;t in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compete for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are telling us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will try it out later with a technical demo .
so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
