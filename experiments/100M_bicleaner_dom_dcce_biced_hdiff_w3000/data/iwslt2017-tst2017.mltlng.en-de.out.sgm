<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had heard illegal phones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA transferred Iran literally blueprints for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government fought against Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train he became a symbol of the pattern of the government to condemn whistleblowers and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitution, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous that they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government leaned at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had done before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they have been saying for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped on Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and rising to make statements, it could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his agreement, bought his telephone cards secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit meeting, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has more condemned than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower left to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitution, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like the government's technology to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">They can do so from the moment they contact, instead of hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that didn't exist when Risen wrote his book and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server for which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain more information covert, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us that not only technology experts like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to bring misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental contributor who raises the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">At least these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data leak of history has been published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money have hidden in tax havens] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox offices in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a trace of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend from childhood days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent rocker or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and the powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens of a few, are being used to hide and veil their fortunes -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were so far no prominent Americans in this Disclosure, that scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But thanks to the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states you need less information, you need less information to start a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Fraud allows scammers to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked us that all up to a lawyer made suggestions to our investigator how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to regard this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not about a single top politician involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very comforting as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed; as if it always will be the rich and the powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see that something has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen a lot more transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has entered into central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudo companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say," "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the intransparency, which now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story that I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after finishing my design studies, I made a stop shop.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to get kidnapped in a Mazdas boot!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what caused me there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, slept on toe tips at the door, and my bedroom door shut.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate goes out and the rent is increased." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something for it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared up.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Bleu czyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the Investors: "we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room you close when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Through the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "this will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you are contemplating the things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting side.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic you can now feel -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Thus, most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who's got Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce to Twitter that he is candidates for the post of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor first presented himself with his name; if he had told where he came from, how to call his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really capture very well locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">This is because a well thought-out feedback system will strengthen trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had handed over their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are about age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation evokes commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "when you talk too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "talk too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there's an optimal degree of openness, such as "Nice works of art in your home! I'm making a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can it be created with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which themes you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the large amount of people who were more than willing to reject these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed to celebrate parties or have devastated flats.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have invited guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays, only a fraction of the problem was a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trust one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, it can result in wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You go to the hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring about books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay will expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled across this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions go together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a matter of economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but to call it simply" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing will not do justice." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People are part of themselves openly, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">It is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visited, a group there would be waiting for you to fill up a thoroughly and show you one at a tavern tour of which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn to cook a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments for the sake of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relations instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children had gone out. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was already available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives me past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay when cheating at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I decided to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, as opposed to the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>

<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the US body, but a vital organ.</seg>

<seg id="331">It might be a couple of parking lots, but don't stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant look at people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington DC area, DC recently: people are actually not being radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalisation, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even by their family, so that the extremists can make a brainwashing, which causes the person to be terrorists the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>

<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam established the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive way of real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We tend to accept an authoritarian system of government, conformance, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that if you submit messages that have been adversely reported about Muslims, they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries and the pruning of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you see when the mood against Muslims flowed upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two periods of time.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>

<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can exert our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we rode silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went into the hall of prayer, and what I saw, let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come, not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packet production penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Through interlocking, airplanes achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must be known collectively, where the mobile objects are located in space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest level, for example" "" "Start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most star-runners it can float, and therefore has big advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of stern starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter in which location the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask about basic abstract questions which are at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known for example as machines with a thousand moving parts, which meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft, which only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flap, hinges and cross rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starter. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right when all of you watch is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is quite symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this way he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions no matter what direction it is turned or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is conceivable in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller drops, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, albeit restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to rethink new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lamp parachute on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages are in development and the act of creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">About 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns changed into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they lighted more brightly than all the stars along in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not set them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, it was just a multi-cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is standing by us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, that are about through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of ligo increased significantly, which improved the recognition capacity enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was started for a final test run to solve some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">The fruits of my life were basically the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has studied gravitational-waves of black holes and her by observatories like Ligo measurable signals for 23 years. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is an effusion in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers often perform a really silly dance in courses for relativity theory.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and stowning, stretching and stowning."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stripped when the waves were picked up. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros according to the comma, followed by a 1.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than one thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example, your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now Alice is talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by observing changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we transform wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen, can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies turn very fast, you can hear the same pair of pups with an additional key change. this sounds like wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu.</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion vocabulary, embossed in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender's sound] Someone who knows what to hear, knows this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's talk about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens a whole new way to explore the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is covered by his own glow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the League of Ligo, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as seen by Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space, the origin of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "before which I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of removing my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of talking, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes, which changed my life profoundly, on an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my smallest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three unbelievable daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kittens" "" "for inexplicable reasons," ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life-attitude in my family. from then on I swore to always play with them as soon as you invite me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things out, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream on television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows simultaneously in production, four TV programs, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running successively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of those 70 TV hours are consignments that I created myself and not just produced, so still overhead. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, so I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work, so you understand that I'm not just walking around the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I understand that it does not dream with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am immersed in my work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops, as if I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As soon as you have a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and rational. and the best thing about it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy road, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people participate when I explain to them the buzz that I'm talking over writing that writing is a joy to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I started to work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you cannot aspire to size differently.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for greatness, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not for failure, and I only know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the humming. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, overdone, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom won't be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "Sweetly, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the humming ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same title work, 15 hours days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing to delegate, a Titan is not asleep, does not give up, with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a flagship Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzzing I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do is suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "take away, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do it, you are working, you love what you do, to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the humming when you know the buzz, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late, and she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "sneak" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she doesn't call anyone" "" "sneak" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it when I'm titanium and fuzz my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters bump, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sum, I can do nothing except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is lost, or whatever the girl let loose in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity everywhere are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzzing, the working environment, the titanium serum, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the aid of broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what is the real buzz.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current that comes from the joie de vivre.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the false words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a fixed rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as easy as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person works better than to be at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rush around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">At the same time, I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always travel to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me naïve for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking to my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more is not needed.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can take 15 minutes a day, even on a bad day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my feeliness, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for his peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "in order to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I be victorious. meeting friends, reading books, enjoying the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to surpass more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes per piece, why not treat yourself to 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totals of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of work is part of me, but just one part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's easy for me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, who is going to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land I create the marathon, the I run, the troops, the screens, the high clay, the buzzing, the buzzing, the other, the right buzz: the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, dying, naked and new feeling of life is wide in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think things out, I'll awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have heard of one of the most well-known, the "cerebellar stimulation." an electrode is implanted deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often nourished patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain is swollen with skull-brain traumas and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the internal pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to use Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to allow cells to grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To allow cells to grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">It is necessary to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to prosper.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts Jean-François managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly shared themselves and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They consist of 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are confronted with a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then color them in color to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we consulted them at the sampling point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-import these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-import the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we imported the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and reimplantated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor-motor sector in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkey who got up spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not as fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now, when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then it is necessary to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an immutable fact.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and an impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "indeed, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was clearly made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my outsighted friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are blamed, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of extravagance, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin-peak paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognise the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, who, however, are too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and bring income to the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, such as "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, in the United States, England and the eurozone, 3,4 billion US dollars were invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, railway tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US Dollar sounds a lot of money until it compares it with the 5.1 billion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing except to inflate stock prices and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin-tops, which are not equated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand that, as in an endless loop, reinforces the pessimism of investors, who, out of fear, the prophecy of the race could come true that his son would kill him if he grows up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily causes the circumstances that cause ecpus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedingly lavish art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents, and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the athenic democracy as a result of these conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which granted them the right to political co-determination with the same mood in questions of state interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very bright, it is burnt out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of the corporations -- was a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present-day democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place, as the economy gradually undermined politics and deprived them of it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power is migrated from politics to the economy and the areas are separate.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's like a herd of predators that sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds, that they starve at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has channelled politics so far that it itself harms itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality increases, the aggregate demand falls, and the directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must reunite politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by substituting low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation lets the twin peaks become higher, the waste sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to reshape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and in doing so make sure that we are democratizing the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy that makes the film "Matrix" like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," in which machines serve human beings and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or to indulge in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians, "Agora," in long talks to the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we should be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in brief.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of enterprises: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those that the companies belong, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, to whom the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no elevating twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please introduce yourself in a nutshell that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund invests in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is simultaneously liberalizing in which they preferred privileged persons, and Marxist, because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it more democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, what Larry Summers calls as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are experiencing, it will destabilise not only our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, that's why I'm a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am perfectly fine.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't swirl, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your speech, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers told you very clearly what you think about the West's view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is played -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I can say so provocatively, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism to democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspected that this was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "to say goodbye to the complacency, and the constant denial that a massive fault line was going through the eurozone and continues to be massive threat to the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, still have chosen the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to sustain life through political will and authoritarianism, it may be delayed for a while, but when the changes occur, it will happen abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Harvest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not the case.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down, only because they did not want to deal with the distortions running through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a disastrous program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "it is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "no one from the Troika, who imposed this policy on us, admitted:" "" "it was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of conversations, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the exposed centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"" "" "" "if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post-modern 1930 what it seems to me, it will also be unbearable for the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for having been with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Most of you have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right corner of this turn.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this will be a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive where, after watching a squeasel, your brain asks: "where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left hand side, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not care to get to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to undermine" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium outcry, the average television -- shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon does such a thing, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And when Amazon comes out for nothing, one really attacks, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who pick up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You can record when to start the show, when to pause, which parts one skips or looks at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process it and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands in 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always on the lookout to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a contest, he and his team viewed the existing data on the Netflix viewer, i.e. the reviews they give to the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went into a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what is going on here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">We have two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">When data analysis does not work, it is a bit frightening, because we live in a time when we are more and more involved in statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the multi-health system here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software. if you come into contact, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the U.S. and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they can predict outbreaks of flu, the bad type, by data analysis of Google's research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year by year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore.</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data streams increasingly into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years, I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">You have to solve a complex problem, mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its individual parts, so you can analyse the individual parts; as a second, put the individual parts together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is to reassemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they have used data and intellect where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why they wouldn't have been able otherwise. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards," which wasn't in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions, first when they compete for TV ideas, then they chose" "" "Alpha House" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "we are telling us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will try it out later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball will be smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
