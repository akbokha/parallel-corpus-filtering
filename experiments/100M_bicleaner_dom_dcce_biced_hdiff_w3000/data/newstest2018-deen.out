Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution , where young people are to meet today .
a pit chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers are cultiv@@ ating the former foundation of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich makes exciting stories for days .
it is annoying when maps are not current .
everybody knows that , who had to get upset , because the car @-@ navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Bavarian State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet very revealing .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ me , which one recognizes as such .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large overview map , detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ position sheets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; were incorporated for cities and municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were developed according to the Bavarian sur@@ ve@@ ying authorities between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French commander occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops finally removed the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , the present neighbors , who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ ve@@ ying administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original sheet for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was built 21 years after the drawing up of the map , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written numbered fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; original recording &quot; from which the property tax was derived .
small plots now occupy no more farmers - but small farmers in the &quot; Land in the Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October qu@@ ests , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the cigar@@ ettes of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohi@@ bits the personnel from applying force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , and later on 500 places were extended .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ si@@ r@@ ary facility in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s biggest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the premises of the former institution .
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex and turned it into a youth home with educational establishments .
West lies the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in an architectural resem@@ b@@ lance to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the shopping street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bombs broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t from the Middle Ages once stood at Mari@@ enhof , where these days are the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will come into force until 28 August 2017 , asks af@@ ro @-@ ameri@@ can travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention while travelling by the state , as a series of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents can be found throughout the country and can be noted here , &quot; says the group .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people more difficult to discrimin@@ ate against discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , which dispro@@ portion@@ ately targets minorities , prompted the group to release the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist offen@@ se against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the voyage and was put into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recently published report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i Office of At@@ tor@@ ney General , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state are stopped by 75 percent more often than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready to have a deposit money or let the relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I hate crime report , which classi@@ fy the state regarding the number of such violations in the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had adopted immigration laws that would ob@@ lige local prosecution authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to the further racial profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but l@@ ately , interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence project is a project of success and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac made a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s CD@@ U town association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties met at the pi@@ v@@ ot yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first gave insights into his farm , in which he cultiv@@ ates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of wood@@ land , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and home in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing way for him for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste there is only region@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ L@@ H@@ V Chairman &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t manage on such steep areas profit@@ ably . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green space ensures a lot of work , much has to be worked on with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ iser , even if he did not conduct bio @-@ operation .
for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader &apos;s support . &quot;
with a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence .
the area of open @-@ maintenance amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be explored until at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 euros were promoted by leader , a quarter bore the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained twelve 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and rural women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Weiß , too , said : &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot;
the landscape @-@ care line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state support of pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a scholarship specified by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be prot@@ rac@@ ted must not be min@@ pper@@ y ( slope incl@@ ination above 35 percent ) and must thus be threatened with for@@ estation .
for the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ hen project 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a fence of 16 kilometres .
the accounting area equ@@ als 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate them as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ eers would have liked him if he had done it .
but it took hold of its importance , and in particular the meaning attributed to it , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally right , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ aries , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , and the w@@ ret@@ ched rub@@ b@@ ish of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not get involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had taken up a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a depic@@ tion of the classical visual representation .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of Ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great scribe R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world : Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not light the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is rather unusual here .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ fic journeys on the deck of ships .
it is all about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would like to acknowledge .
their torch will not light the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power will ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ ges Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is reminiscent of a time when only two Scot@@ s@@ men belonged to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championship Team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK have to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ sch - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m stretch , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team for team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in quite naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , competing in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ s@@ men are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best overall ath@@ lete at the World Championship was seven , which have been reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this road and last year has set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 metres , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch for a great season that included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle is reminded of her first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says that she is &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of her country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team mates have voted for me and chose me , it makes something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
as to my speech as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship .
it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiastadion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the in@@ heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from home affairs to his political principles .
he shr@@ ank with criticism , certainly .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him therefore at the beginning of this week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash response with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if there is a type such as Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to lose his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of people coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is officially called and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ prof@@ ane .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other latest news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t really appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same topic , they are more likely to be regarded as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor &apos;s staff designated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical colum@@ ni@@ sts and to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but this is exactly what is happening digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck on his leadership .
and even at that time , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain over@@ came his ministry , according to historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not put them into silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ courses and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
the former European no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year passed alongside Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he found this place .
he is an avi@@ d defender of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels particularly good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on the home floor .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer by passive smoking
fewer and fewer people have died for passive smoking in lung cancer over the past two decades .
to this end , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are present in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994 .
at that time , there have been more than 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ inger Straße &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are reasonably in time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much hiding in the underground , which is not realised in the plans .
traffic , which continuously obstruc@@ ts construction work , is a big problem for the construction company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut @-@ off gates is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rule in the rest@@ less Indones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ coal tu@@ ber is removed and eng@@ ul@@ fed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example to wash clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a tile room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were voted by a public raise in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up the independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated iron roofs that have been converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones by rust .
only very few In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has min@@ ed gold and copper worth $ 3.1 billion .
in addition , Papua has wood resources valued at an estimated $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military operations and units almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal country in the 1970 @-@ s became a genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are losing everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is stated in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e , which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric shock are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have intensified because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring about an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is of 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ping Cant@@ ons sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who moved to the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua - Mama @-@ Mama from Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as the Jok@@ the@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 district districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ the@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ the@@ i &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols off a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers ki@@ cked off their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ le @-@ rif@@ les , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child aged 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the Wa@@ ita Dance - in a circle running continuously and a bird song - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to sling stones at police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers by an internal funk : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ amen , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house .
Kay@@ amen still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but he says that the ball came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who was a witness to the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans , only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more wounded .
the news on the kill@@ ings only arrived on the following day &quot; filtered &quot; to Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks , Jok@@ the@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic ab@@ uses in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he will establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of violations of human rights have already been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not stop .
on Tuesday , Indones@@ ian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious husband to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
the villa@@ gers excited prot@@ esting against the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing a warning .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament called on to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a disaster for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal family Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua @-@ movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthy migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua rarely has capital or skills needed to make their own companies competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua @-@ Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , although the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ai &apos;s election campaign to raise restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest eastern provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on Indones@@ ian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man for the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the Group &apos;s alleg@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the meeting , but would remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the states are unlikely to vote again for Jok@@ the@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ the@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai kis@@ ses , &quot; says Gob@@ a@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants to know that Jok@@ the@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ the@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims had a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried in an area just across the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre @-@ high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in only two years , which is by chance called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that the fire fighting units fighting the fire against 4.@@ 00 o &apos;clock local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident may revi@@ ve questions concerning the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said that the system of panels to isol@@ ate and cl@@ ash to the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : more best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport was to play a Davis Cup single only on two stak@@ es , thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
these often very long , but also therefore very estimated five @-@ sentence classics are preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ cely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
not only after the vote was the proposal after many appeals before the proposal to carry out the finale at a neutral place .
only comparatively minor details will be added in 2018 : the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup fin@@ alists will have the right to host the first round in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden items into the aircraft , find a survey
a survey conducted on air passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or un@@ consciously forbidden items were smu@@ g@@ gled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft while they accidentally wore banned knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed that they were late discovered that they were mistakenly shot with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people , carried out by a Jet Charter Service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers were more likely to dis@@ regard the rules .
those surv@@ eyed admitted that they have know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent millenni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common objects deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
more than 3 percent admitted to have know@@ ingly carried items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dently had smu@@ g@@ gled smu@@ g@@ gled goods through the airport security and how many had intentionally done it .
it is no surprise that the people who wear the best smu@@ g@@ gling ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly most frequently .
the company points out , however , that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure what kind of fluids they are allowed to carry or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to display the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
in doing so , he has so far suggested that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever @-@ triumph@@ ant numbers of sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed a different , less gl@@ it@@ tering figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance : the revers@@ al of the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k has often adverti@@ sed more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics always pointed out that it is only a matter of non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation . &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations stipul@@ ate , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it is said that all models will be 500@@ ,000 , one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 reservations per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never @-@ tested production lines without major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if it comes to greater delays , then the un@@ binding of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent cont@@ ented customers from running away in flocks .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt reti@@ res because of the hes@@ it@@ ant of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
a day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities as compared to previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint which had been lod@@ ged against his previous position in a Federal Labour Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a period that went on October 1 for States to comply with the standards set out by O@@ zone in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the observ@@ ance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere with local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was appointed by Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney General of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly crossed over to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Employment Court in Washington has decided that the EPA administrator exceeded its authority when trying to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards would simply reinforce the willingness of the EP@@ O to co @-@ operate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in earlier administr@@ ations , the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and all other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet voted in the Senate .
the New York general prosec@@ utor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York closed in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the emerging smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year can contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about P@@ ru@@ itts &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from those responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche the old grav@@ ey@@ ard area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ ficent Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the place have made friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ lin@@ gens their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martini emphasizes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the S. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ customizable book : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the word of the deed , on the Hill of Tum@@ our , besides the former parish church , there was also a magnificent court to which the Church or the patron of the patron belonged to and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , besides the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village @-@ picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the man@@ orial settlement @-@ centre of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 confirm these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , equipped and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this own church .
in this way , the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two crushed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell then rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead out of listeners .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Church of Hil@@ ari@@ us was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half fell .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g existing today remained a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius system from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sheep retired &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as organizers , the Friends and Don@@ ors invite Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old grav@@ ey@@ ard to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
it is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking about the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3 : 30 pm .
to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers highlight the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ ul@@ ers and listeners .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to their home care , as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martini affir@@ ms .
association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association has called upon Coun@@ cill@@ or Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there is a wind power concentration zone .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the urban area .
such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; rec@@ ess &quot; of the landscape .
the town of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette only a few days earlier - but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve of a mould failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art status : before the summer break , the City Council once again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is excluded from planning law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received by the circle Vier@@ sen last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it as an opportunity to re @-@ examine the matter .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette the construction of four wind turbines each 200 metres high .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is involved , had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11,@@ 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ se@@ ater households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded in death .
two other people were slightly injured .
the country road remained closed for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car entered the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother .
city and tra@@ der plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region are expected to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract the inhabitants to the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should raise the customers awareness of what offers the city &apos;s own city offers apart from the usual supermarket goods .
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local firms will present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the campaign aims not only to residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
the Municipal Administration and Trade Association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; Active Tag &quot; to the well @-@ known Sunday , with sales of all trades and hosts in order to actively participate in active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened again or again .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - up to land@@ lords , businesses of the whole city and clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly wi@@ dened , king said in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thür@@ inger cities will take part in the country &apos;s third country @-@ shopping day for the first time .
apart from Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchasing behaviour .

Tr@@ ump set out after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of telep@@ hon@@ y Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump invited En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president compla@@ ined because he had publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States , and to make Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a cl@@ amped exchange .
Mr. Turn@@ bull , Mr. Turn@@ bull , said that a trade for the US refugees that emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would let him look like a &quot; dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ch act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and was rum@@ ma@@ ging on the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train to his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged down from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , played on July 22nd , is just a post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience ki@@ cked out very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists go back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were yn@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years , no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights activists .
for him , the post @-@ election serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that a wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays down a blanket on the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one ever was charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the open for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer campaign .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FB@@ I of the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to release Mal@@ com from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they got away from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the mur@@ ders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in murder , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is vivid , gri@@ pping and gro@@ unded in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of chief clan member for many years , but he said that the role would never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors were rehear@@ sing Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ ch , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and push@@ es him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire is reci@@ proc@@ ated .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ ed lou@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raz@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people back then --- he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers wit@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship sub@@ stitutes the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ ch says the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends ab@@ rup@@ tly and quickly .
there are scre@@ ams , shots , and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman clothed with a mourning dress stands above the body of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mourning lobby &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators wi@@ pes sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing humidity for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope away and wipe away their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ ch embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience ming@@ les with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta ch@@ ats about the reproduction with a black pair that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words , which feeling has left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ n is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today this is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post is inspiring in a way as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ stor@@ eyed setting .
the rotation stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) can be seen as an option to show a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner including the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from East times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it there is an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ le@@ vers pos@@ ing as rock@@ ers , or alternatively an is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine @-@ le@@ vers - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
in Hollywood fashion , K@@ ESS seduc@@ es them with Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) and put a corp@@ se into the trunk and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the gorgeous fi@@ esen Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a gravity box .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe in it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with powerful applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bly bow themselves to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , are celebrated stor@@ my .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual clothing .
the performance was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
in 2013 , he had still had to reti@@ re in 2013 , and five years later , there was a great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; bu@@ h &quot; calls went underground .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its point of view .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in a number of places in their volunte@@ ering year .
where everywhere ?
crowd : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I am here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have also worked at school in an open all @-@ day .
what are your experiences ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old , thus a late @-@ working volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I did Ab@@ itur .
and then a civil engineer studies , let &apos;s say , successfully broke off .
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
make a social year , there is an insight , as you can see how it really is on the spot , in the focal point .
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester .
I will study dual studies , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunte@@ ering service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you are going to be FS@@ J .
you can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works out .
in contrast to civil engineering studies ?
amount : well , here it is not a question of extra@@ pol@@ ating st@@ ati@@ ks .
you always have other people up@@ side down , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager that has been taken out of the family , must always deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son falls down further 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve business
the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will de@@ grade more 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job cuts that General Director John Fall@@ on announced mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019 are in addition to his previous restructuring , in which already 4,000 jobs were lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a cost reduction plan for cost reduction of another 300 million pounds ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast move to digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the Ber@@ tel@@ smann partner last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldiers killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , Afghanistan , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter had been viol@@ ated , shared a statement by NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ Arab quarter .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive set . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ic is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby district .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a huge bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops th@@ ron@@ ged the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in the past few weeks , the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also have caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and , in particular , the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by law@@ suits
the U.S. environmental authority has made a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it showed the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of the EPA , the O@@ zone provisions - in which in a part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured to determine where cuts need to be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is supposed to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the Democrats and conservation groups who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the S@@ EPA website states that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community plan wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the council of flu@@ orn @-@ win@@ ches decides to establish a communal space in the future senior residence .
before the discussion there is an important information : the sales contract for the remaining part of the property is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
while it will still last until the area belonging to the congregation is part of the community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be done by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space for this .
one of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area of approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council are ho@@ vering in front of such a common area not to be seen as a meeting point only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ ority just living , but openly entering into the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , will be reconc@@ iled .
the building is located in the renovation area .
according to T@@ j@@ aden , the establishment of a communal space would be capable of supporting up to 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed resolution is to signal the investor that in this respect it is not intended to throw a bil@@ l@@ lion between the legs , the finding that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as pul@@ sed roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer does not mean this addition .
when it helps : he passes the committee unanim@@ ously .
it is not as easy as the common room .
Daniela Ruf refers to the many of its own buildings , with which one is not so easy to move forward , but now they lean on the common room from the window , she says , &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is strictly speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy of wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area , there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter @-@ value , which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposal to appro@@ ve the proposed resolution finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ises with the original program that Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we grasp the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision by car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the street
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was seriously injured .
like the police informed me , the 82 @-@ year long Lan@@ gen@@ felder had been on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg with his bicycle on the road from the direction of Hil@@ den on the way .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove to the road , however , he apparently did not regard the opposite .
he met with a car driving a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ch carriage .
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must let the game fight against Dortmund .
with personnel care , the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven pro@@ s are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
human resources at German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger ahead of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also refrain from using the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
wander from star to star in resin
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the Harz Mountains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the Stern@@ warte St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information of many resin visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question arises St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Star@@ path Train will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path , the viewers learn a lot of interesting facts , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is more light than another , even though it is far more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation you find yourself a selected star and when to see it best .
since 2014 , the association operates the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with bare eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned star wer@@ g - the planet path since 2003 .
starting in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ ae leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an extra @-@ terrestrial location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( church ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a bul@@ let of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun at exactly 75 meters measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance from the planetary route is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fix@@ ture would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ fe@@ ather weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mate noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to heav@@ y@@ weight .
and he has to move to weight @-@ weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans want .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , also interested in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he value Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko said with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the Ri@@ ver@@ side Champion Champion is very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum they built for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and this is Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured to tire bur@@ ners
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 hrs before the end of the connection .
the car drove to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service the A@@ 7 was closed for about an hour in the direction of the north , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener to Braunschweig that optim@@ ises defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season finale Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result as well , were not the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf defense player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three chain should also be further optimized .
and a gate after an excav@@ ation doesn &apos;t want to catch the For@@ tun@@ en any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be so that no one else stops alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team gets better after the experience in preparation with the three chain , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the middle of the chain at the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premis@@ e is , however , that we are even better in harmony and we cannot afford so many ab@@ err@@ ations in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak of a failed start after a draw , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only judge the start into the season after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ mat@@ urely for a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Fort@@ una &apos;s interior defender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland , as a light favourite , go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we are entitled to get under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as Chief Operating Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ age application tests published
the recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rhe@@ um@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the asylum process , you should take a closer look at age after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Mig@@ ration@@ ale ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until today , migration sales have sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to be tested and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been stable over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 results published , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves evaluating the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do it as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proceeding well .
on Wednesday a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Traffic and Transport at the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg .
in April , work began at the same time on all three bridge bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch arch bridge made of concrete , cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long respectively .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning got a 1.@@ 30 m wide and seven tons so @-@ called bridge cap on the northern side .
this is a border fixation that is also used as operating mode .
a 2,@@ 20 m wide bridge cap should be inserted on the southern part of the bridge on Friday .
then the pedestrian path is to be lost .
the special thing about it is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires a special feeling of intuition .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
furthermore , fish and cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collection point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is controlled in one lane by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully locked .
the costs for the three brid@@ ge@@ ings amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which would otherwise only be difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day , because the Af@@ D invites the municipal hall R@@ ond@@ ell to the loud &quot; big election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ developers but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town picnic under the motto &quot; Every@@ thing at a table &quot; is planned at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place in the parking lot below the fund - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oly , chairman of the forum A world and one of the leading organisers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which the Af@@ D can eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel reports that he tried to make such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the fund , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also true : at about 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the rear of the pension , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k to hold their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far , the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can withdraw - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ enb@@ acher tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series of Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; World Music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz mon@@ op@@ ener N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play combine to form a fascinating whole artwork .
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was Robert P@@ att@@ inson &apos;s &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague , who eventually dealt very bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the b@@ rün@@ ette performer ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I have been reading . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has never been confused or hin@@ dered me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them she suffered , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in school time , when she would rather dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , sc@@ ared and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to get in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself in front of the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said governor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... Today I &apos;ll tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice endor@@ sed not the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee gave an explanation on Thursday evening in which it was said : &quot; the party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is just the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an apparent excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sport .
Russian athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said it was sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were cut out of gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised in itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do all possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress was made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes compete for the athle@@ tics world championships starting on Friday in London based on the rigorous IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
memorial for soldiers cut off in Mali
during a funeral service in the North Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers have been thinking about a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
the Minister of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the still un@@ resolved fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died a week ago in Mali on Wednesday .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday .
at noon only the relatives of the church took leave .
then the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the stran@@ g@@ gles laid down roses , the relatives were arm @-@ in @-@ arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the opposite soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann developed the flight operations of the helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the prime minister of the Le@@ yen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and she was told in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also sub@@ mits the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crown Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ ble@@ man , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked in the French embassy on the Th@@ ames .
during his later wife &apos;s sympath@@ ies , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was gay , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk so@@ cks instead of k@@ nit@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and had the reputation of being the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the parliament , he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , he spoke out for the resolution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising discharge of a Gre@@ ens from its parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ jackets justified her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to take it up .
with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have seated 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it imperative that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the State Constitution also provides the opportunity for the Minister @-@ President to withdraw confidence and elect a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be legally tested , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will address all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something kur@@ i@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;

the Gre@@ ens called for the seclu@@ ded dep@@ u@@ ties to return their land state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that they return their land sc@@ and@@ als , which they received via the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have consciously decided not to speak a foreign language . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Represent@@ atives in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the Land@@ tag .
the leaving of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her desp@@ ised vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is doing this dirty trick and tries to make political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves against Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the Editorial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , what we are currently aware of , health hazards are practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the explan@@ atory is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the dis@@ agreement of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same responsibility as manufacturers to ensure that the goods sold are safe and harmless to health .
if the residual water content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in case of eggs , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ polluted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , the production companies are not liable for immediate blame .
rather , they have to face economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too few inspec@@ tors in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is there only a lack of personnel or a coherent competence ?
the official controls , which have uncovered the process , were just the official controls .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent .
this is precisely why a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm mis@@ m necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pan@@ ted means that manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle it must be clear that the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the posture of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are resolved quickly and without interruption .
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules that have been launched by UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make money loose with security in order to sign N@@ ey@@ mar and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but they have to interact with legitimate sources of income that allow them to reach the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini for his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the club debts to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini died in 2015 from the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Pres@@ i@@ dency , his successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are off from excessive spending .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely enhance the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the redemption rate for the next five years can be stated in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( back then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs trying to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate in@@ comes .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup amb@@ ass@@ adors will be and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to find out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G so far mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive , try every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding the last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state funded by a society .
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new parent supplier
for the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is ahead of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be insp@@ ected every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
some 17 million small red @-@ white packaging sheets of 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ de@@ es before landing to passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more importantly the advertising effect is : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are interested in the new call for ten@@ ders .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment .
Swiss has been distributing chocolate tablets since 2006 on board their flights .
prior to closing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss introduced the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of co @-@ operation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights , the First Class customers will be p@@ am@@ pered with goo@@ dies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; to the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained a pri@@ mal story for a promising tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by getting on the core of the G@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who will grow up - they still managed to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults playing adults now , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody is more based on the casting principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand held by the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
one point sticks to a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious plot included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ courses are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose ex @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that could inc@@ ite this fran@@ chise like a sort of repe@@ ating &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the gang how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ to @-@ west ring @-@ combat icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director indicates that a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police sp@@ ends time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask - that it often plays like a single one .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was edited on a lower length could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re since Greg@@ ory and I@@ os@@ ef are always visiting the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a vag@@ ue .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger story and with theirs .
attack on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police managed to hit the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office Kon@@ stanz announced on Friday .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officers ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of time @-@ consuming ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators participated in the action .
a total of more than 300 police officers were in action .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crimes , severe acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the traffi@@ cking of drugs in southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the big effort on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the investigations were aimed primarily at Italian citizens with closely related to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the band &apos;s account .
Weise lam@@ ents big gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the German Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the foreign country registry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned way in an analysis that is present in the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to information , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register , including approximately 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign country authorities in Germany .
because the data wasn &apos;t well maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in some cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data input can significantly slow revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , in the statistics of sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to leave at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false ordin@@ ances led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a distorted debate on dealing with ex@@ tran@@ scripts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus says in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government obviously started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children once they have entered the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this goes out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this paper , it is said that the BA@@ MF performs such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the paper referred to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state which they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , the country can send it back to the country of travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy submitted guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided blood donations for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now has 100 donations in the meantime , distributed 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the session of the Municipal Council , the congregation hon@@ ors the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is created for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available for foreigners , &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the District Director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ed foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents .
that way , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions performed in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K District Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre was led to higher number of participants a few years ago .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Sh@@ ort@@ cake counted among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded with 50 blood donations each .
Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times per 500 milli@@ liter of their juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the slow@@ down in inflation have mut@@ ed speculation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Monetary Committee voted with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , whereby less members increased in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but she sign@@ alled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ tail the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that loan costs may have to rise more than expected at financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth business cycle that was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is expected now that it will provide € 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this year and next year are projected to be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell on these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change will come after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations for interest increase and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to fall by 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will slightly recover after the Bank at the end of the year .
the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and slight increases in wages , as the tightening is getting worse before it becomes worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the drop in income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming years , but added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year guidance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will offset some of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pounds .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until it will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers in July demanding an increase of 0.5 % .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will be attracting them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be attributed to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline in the swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive as len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in the N@@ HS as of September after a fight against the High Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sexual pre @-@ treatment pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by healthcare via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be one of the first to allow people to register , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p has significantly reduced HIV transmission at risk of infection .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours prior to intercourse .
among those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in hospitals , appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed by £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the progress lasting more than three decades in cop@@ ing with one of mankind &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , if it is targeted specifically for people in need , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is actually controlled individually and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now has to be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
it is now important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the termination of the dis@@ semination of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank with a real estate passion , reduced himself from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively in order to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible for Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , room and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it seem longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units provide space for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room the beauty of the living room can lock up the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mutual , so that when you lift the door , it slides very lightly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time to use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that touch and which help create emotional ties in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of something standard in something quite amazing .
indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide not to leave it .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate @-@ empire Victori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million .
former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood since 1973 .
there the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to &apos;s development areas , apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler , as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court file states that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul valued at $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reviews proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first affir@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held .
the brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise , with hundreds of sites with affir@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops in the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they made use of the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans@@ shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land on trial , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million for leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , according to Paul , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; provoked by the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ held himself very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the television super@@ star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in replied by SMS , to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name from the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met with executive staff on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that has fallen into the hands of the President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ ump Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ ump Twitter was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ ump T@@ we@@ ets would not have contained any more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never experience something about the twe@@ ets that tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his co @-@ workers manage to keep away from it a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently prevented tr@@ ump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
Politi@@ co - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of advis@@ ers to provide the President with question@@ able information for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; current and former dump officials say that tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where they originate from .
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody mali@@ ci@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy secretary of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence , or that he has vo@@ iced wrong accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ smith added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped for .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police all over Europe sends a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; virtual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; postcard to dangerous criminals on the run this summer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy break@@ ers are not well @-@ known , references from the population will be hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting had to hide at vacation destinations , called Euro@@ pol .
I have collected 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
36 of the online requests could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of indications after publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with a few brave travellers on foot , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch tow@@ ed by the commune in order to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their men &apos;s houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road called Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire range &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their incur@@ sions .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advice must be put into action by Sch@@ am , since he was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved and are back now .
more came back yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot stop this once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to move it forward as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible call an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour with the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we set our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is to be opened on 1 March next year .
that &apos;s good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the then Ambiente Rhein@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year as well as income from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the district , the hotel building offered to the district council as a collective accommodation , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers from deplo@@ ying a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Lord Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the location of the hotel and already spoke of serious interested people at the house at that time .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been building she@@ eting containers in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were demol@@ ished , ceilings partly broken down , old bath tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an elevated inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its 60 rooms , wishes to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s ideas are similar to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also brought forward to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Issu@@ er sets Grand Jury

&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee received the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there are already initial charges in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focuses on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more Tr@@ ump private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Issu@@ er Tr@@ ump has personally moved to the centre and accused the accus@@ ation whether the president may have obstruc@@ ted justice in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to check present evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether they should be charged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bun@@ tings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are usually turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite people to inter@@ rog@@ ation under oath .
according to CN@@ N , invitations were issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement , in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ ump couns@@ ellor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election campaign leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were also in conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television that the translation show that Mu@@ eller does not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the elevation of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the Democrats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but he usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
there is no reason to accept that something has changed , it was said in the declaration .
Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this rape , accus@@ ations against tr@@ ump have become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and his collabor@@ ators .
this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to be released .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the late President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed as easily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg from the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has been solved by the ice shelf .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the big col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion metric tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
he does not risk a danger for people .
according to research data , to what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg .
in total , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a background background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven .
the ice shelf flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it always grows further into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
at the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the equilibrium of wa@@ xes and break@@ downs was disturbed a few years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete pe@@ e @-@ file there .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ pe@@ e @-@ file is in danger , because the front edge has never been pulled back as far as at present .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can crum@@ ble if a piece ab@@ rup@@ ts at a key point .
melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ts and Eis@@ berg does not raise sea level because they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after melting itself .
however , the loss of the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a limited extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ts is the fourth biggest hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e of Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 metres .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wi@@ dest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists it is cont@@ ested whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ts will be growing again or in the long run and possibly coinci@@ de , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers do not bring back the demo@@ lition of this giant ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many of the polar regions of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long c@@ rest of the Antar@@ ctic extends to South America .
according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research program , the polar area of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature contributed to the decline .
in the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and thus en@@ umer@@ ates the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U calls to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new vac@@ ancies in the administration were linked .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the courses at the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be allocated this year were to be recorded .
nevertheless , the group is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are still 50 un@@ occupied places by the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general management are sought .
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the request of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recovery and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent internally and externally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an education offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other towns adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this involves a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .
thus high time for action so that not even more jobs will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , head of the CD@@ U Group , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he had long been in the circle of circles for a bad surprise when he publicly challenged personnel costs and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfying solution in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a ho@@ ary rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials than it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service .
sal@@ aries are currently prescribed exactly , increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown increasingly over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stit@@ uting protection law .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Regional Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy ag@@ grav@@ ates the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they are not allowed to continue if they do not abide by new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat by the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to give detailed proposals to the Italian public prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations currently collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his crew takes on board din@@ gh@@ y migrants who are delivered to them directly from dealers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart for the ships to be used again .
at least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed so far to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel Peace Prize organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
meanwhile , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
An@@ sti@@ ege and Tri@@ als
nine wis@@ mers Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and Wine Festival from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
observation points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , a look@@ out spot on the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga is equi@@ pping for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium ra@@ mps in wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have also recognised the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is sure , &quot; that there are still several clubs on this train . &quot;
next weekend FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds apart from the fact that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract one could be far more often present on these markets online than to send the German lig@@ ament to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games such as League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA Cup simulation will be fought at competitive level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and e @-@ sport is already part of the official program for the Asian games 2022 .
but is this a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ o also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in classical sports - such as increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction to reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the custom player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more an issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players are internationally active , this is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural obstacles .
a study by the company consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and large tournaments .
in three years , turnover is expected to lie at 130 million .
against the 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries have already been international .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ ingen Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe as well .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ o .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football league clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is lag@@ ging behind in European comparison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to decay only in nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is not enough today .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company with the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t keep in mind that everything stays the same in football as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy pushing for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through lyrics and calls for suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my son was my best friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward facing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor said to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy saying that there is &quot; no day in which I don &apos;t em@@ bed the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more to have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn the generator into place and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter wanted attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press from the event .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ mir was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern def@@ ends a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
something was different in his place in the cabin , which looked at Joshua Kim@@ mir immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he stopped his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ mir was able to interpret the character of the coach .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a guide in the C @-@ El@@ f pro@@ s , who had just arrived from the holiday , but he was chosen as a guide .
sugar is distributed as a gift to those of whom one wants to catch a lot , which one wants to keep in a good mood .
those who have been chosen to embar@@ k on L@@ ah@@ m &apos;s legacy can use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ mir confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flew over the field as a mini @-@ l@@ ah@@ m .
to the right rear , this is now its position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and at all k@@ im@@ me worked in this starting formation like the one that can take the helm one in the hand .
he gave instructions to ste@@ er the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal started to re@@ play his missing fitness ( barely collap@@ sed ) ; Ren@@ ato patches with that , on de@@ vil@@ s , to get out of the achievements of the Asia journey ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ß were not neg@@ atively affected in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
this at least folded quite well .
Sü@@ ß was running beside Kim@@ mich , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted very confi@@ dently .
the famous Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ ß was also trying to win a couple of times in the game setup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance in his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also brought up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bayern world is still for the new arri@@ vals , one saw afterwards the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ mir said good@@ bye to a few crisp words in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from the south : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one any more .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises pace
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing addresses the wishes of the economy which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us is the biggest revers@@ al in infrastructure policy : the gap of highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
the Ministry is still hoping for a planning process this year , until 2021 is expected to be the right of construction .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal transport network .
the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says spokesperson Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as is suggested by Wis@@ sing , an Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in wine to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing pra@@ ises an open ear for people who want to start their own company , the Chamber pra@@ ises .
the Chamber of Crafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1,000 euros is fores@@ een for the passed master exam and 2500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years of their master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , facts are quickly to be created , at the same time , the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) .
up to now , 56 new engineers who wish to hire bis@@ sing in the state @-@ run business have only occupied 29 jobs .
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the receipt of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled labour in the region .
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country was further sober@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies rated grid supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with a rating of 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined of stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , former Minister for Economic Affairs , is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies she had already cleared the field again .
Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW stated that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW chairman said that the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options as travel restrictions , &quot; referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - bann@@ ing or restric@@ ting diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a call@@ back .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des em@@ itting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the costs for autom@@ akers to install systems for the neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of hi@@ ring the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen &apos;s mistakes which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation equipment that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be brought to trial in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen once the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions legislation in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously damp@@ en Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
those who go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building paper wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a big inf@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to an publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is meant to shar@@ pen the wild flow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , the raft passed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour .
Mor@@ dil@@ los C@@ losing Bun@@ ni@@ es and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on@@ ists , the pop @-@ n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an exc@@ els and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greeting cards - what frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to an end in the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures revol@@ ve in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .
via cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches , his dro@@ ll figures still find a lot of spread worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack @-@ of @-@ a @-@ foot@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to be found on the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced by word .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining due to the drought @-@ remin@@ ding conditions and insect @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the service life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with e@@ there@@ al oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian town of R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
merchants , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ u@@ ers or a landing camp should be experienced in the inner city these days .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly paper Ri@@ odo@@ sius usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for coverage of the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are enough .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of being on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals making the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the corp@@ ses accumulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 .
among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ sius , the co @-@ founder Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ sius Building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Special Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders committed every year with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
at Ri@@ odo@@ sius they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ ent and even though the terrain is even more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ sius in the province capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times , probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated two @-@ stor@@ eyed m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ sius , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February , there was an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue when it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second error was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper published by the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ sius and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without hitting the drug poison problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved publishing hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could cur@@ tail like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was gener@@ ously embra@@ ced with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .
now they ask : was his love of routine his ruin ?
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best they can do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ sius met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ sius in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor himself did not call trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain scenery , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ sius made three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of former well @-@ known Bo@@ xer Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é on the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , through a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone knows in town : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption .
Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers would have looked at Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best @-@ informed source of the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists because their employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped up a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country by defe@@ ating them in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth .
she has since asked for her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her fur@@ y has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that in Mexico journalists were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a valid society .
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the Media W@@ äch@@ ter@@ gruppe &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am for my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones stand next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ el with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who go back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that the drug trade is frigh@@ tened by him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ sius sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with belt riv@@ als and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a number of cart@@ el emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the cur@@ v@@ board edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ sius via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are near to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez looked at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ sius followed his mark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the unbelievable N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ er have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved mor@@ din@@ osau@@ rs ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition amaz@@ es researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth@@ works .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only blin@@ king your eyes , you could almost believe that it was sleeping , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used an shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ insul@@ t , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to blend better in its surroundings and avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to detect it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ ors over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs were driven from sufficient pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal for clu@@ es about his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , came into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Sou@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved fla@@ ky skin , but remains intact also in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early cycle time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k period was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta millions of years , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
this includes the ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that prot@@ ru@@ de from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the din@@ osau@@ r &apos;s underwater cre@@ mation kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of this special exempl@@ ar are so well preserved that the house @-@ branches still cover b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael G@@ resh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rare as a win in the lot@@ tery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I watch it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied lef@@ to@@ vers of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole . &quot;
in the storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass slaughter .
there are many injured , miles of jams and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) about 20 people were injured at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first information of the police , around 5@@ pm between the connecting places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , under a thunder@@ storm , nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , were inter@@ tw@@ ined .
at first there were no information on the exact number of the injured persons .
a police spokes@@ man said it was mild to moderate injuries .
a large ban on rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of the direction of the direction of the direction of the direction of the city of Munich , there was a gap of approximately ten kilometres .
as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , it also came on the counter @-@ road to massive obstruc@@ tions - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pun@@ ishments .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tested &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ a .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we wi@@ den it out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train the card evaluation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some pre@@ conditions have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
it also has to be purchased from the App by Deutsche Bahn , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic evaluation will then appear with the test customers .
the train atten@@ dant will receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at PLA@@ Y Y , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep silent .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel by our train crew without ticket control , simply check in the DB Navigator itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s Marketing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often train , know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest offen@@ ders .
because of@@ ten@@ times one does not have all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets in any case .
either the credit card or identity card is missing or otherwise a document you have to present .
the result is endless discussion between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the part or large room and delays in controlling one &apos;s own tickets and taking the time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same track are not enabled yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on August 9 , 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed her Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ ets the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she put her cell phone down to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people scre@@ aming , and a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took off her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th century .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the viewpoint of people who live in communion and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had on the black experience and black condition countless times before this morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them along , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to free ourselves in order to free ourselves .
although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would do it a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to her mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt In@@ mates .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l the project closer together with six other natives followed the Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets team ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are portra@@ yed , as I will be portra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said , laugh@@ ing when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women have to carry the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it insi@@ sts , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ zed type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of its identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sha@@ ved this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not by chance , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , F@@ erg@@ us@@ on news cameras have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the soci@@ opoliti@@ cal atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels obliged to remember that since she went on the road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people even though it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has been spl@@ itting the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the theme is hardly cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some say to the bit @-@ gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be real class &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no human being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , of which also the other shops benefit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition : the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct markets offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a Square with the possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; for many years we have been shopping almost weekly in the farmer &apos;s market hall .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s egg for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing takes place in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this will probably not be very low with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops here are empty - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a decent weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly directly offered by the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , store shops are rented in a shopping centre only by bigger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer .
too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market place during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the Ges@@ pen@@ st bit gallery already manage to sell all the shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it won &apos;t work .
and nobody needs a shopping center that stands empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to encourage a real peasant market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly identical - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st for@@ fei@@ ted a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after having publicly disclosed diplomatic reports about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his ministry .
through algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted for 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette bl@@ unt and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal to Bri@@ eff@@ er@@ onds who exchanged multiple letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chelsea would convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and heavy at the opening of the exhibition , because Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths to fl@@ aming up the rigid spl@@ its which it should actually remedy .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about all these things after the strange timing , she said that &quot; things happen for a specific reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic @-@ novel .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she emerges from the discipline barracks of the United States like King Kong with a hands @-@ on telephone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they keep your speech , they won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ rum , which together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also goal @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bites .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead in the scene of the event , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
La@@ them has been an associate professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an email statement that La@@ sie has now been in absence and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair examined by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help the US investig@@ ators in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was not clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a multitude of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA schedule in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in co @-@ operation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the WA@@ DA schedule was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the website of the Organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that might cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren in alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in regards to the matter , mut@@ ko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are conducting the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system got a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not give anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing control in Russia in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal by WA@@ DA .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a visit to Moscow &apos;s headquarters in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moved in the right direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be re @-@ deployed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell any eggs for now
this divided the groups of companies .
it was a matter of pure precau@@ tion , it could not be expected from any health impairment , it was said in the message .
from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ containing anti @-@ lice .
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next user
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - che@@ ating .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not dare the process .
&quot; there has never been consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ ups race is at growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide special groups and demo@@ graphics groups , to provide staff anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap poll@@ s and poll@@ s of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low consent results - so you can re@@ boot why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the fin@@ anz@@ echni@@ cal website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent GmbH lets companies send tailored &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time , and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that employees can report bad behavior .
and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion has gr@@ asp@@ ed the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and law@@ suits , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and processes and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practi@@ c@@ - can be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical bre@@ aches due to the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry went online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and debit the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
in February , Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets like Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors reach yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies are running well when employees are committed and engaged .
when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company take no action .
in fact , when a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ fy employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have committed too much to collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow people , ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after the gathering of feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday the company gets new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better engagement of employees in a sector that is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are enter@@ tained on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the fry postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during the Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood performed practical exercises .
20 before the beginning of the formal preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supported the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on her three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pressed it down , they are moving on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that had already been thrown with foot@@ balls , which had a protection net behind a goal post , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people will rent a room there and then set out to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to fac@@ tual reviews of third parties and then display their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and send them to fac@@ tual reviews that may display the results of the fact review from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to be punished by social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hat@@ eful poll@@ s like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding out which stories of failure reviews third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook continues to test its feature to the &quot; related article &quot; and working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I have only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome @-@ greeting &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape painters , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust only got full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families .
guys , let everything go their way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into English history on a broader base , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , whom the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is depicted in the 18th century , who stages his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se revenues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his mission in the castle Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle clo@@ aked in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the closure of the 301 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a feast on Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the chapel of the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think of this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wrote on their website that was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that we as Bad Honne@@ f citizens appreciate the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , they stand in competition with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f has an average fifth @-@ digit amount and costs its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts in Ankara about retirement and carriage in the officer cor@@ ps .
this is how this week too .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after put@@ sch@@ ism .
the meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff , as in former times , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions .
as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the head@@ count .
the government is attracting the re@@ ins in the military .
although Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the forces of air and the nav@@ y were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan was fired in 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees the Erdo@@ gan as a wire @-@ pul@@ ler for the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people directly involved in the put@@ sch attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the coup attempt as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
there are concerns in the general staff because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the ban on the head of soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the great deal in the army and security forces is going on anyway .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan allowed more 7@@ 3@@ 95 civilian servants to fire by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan was t@@ aming the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual lords of the country .
three times , they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is specifically driving an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum from persecution abroad after the attempted coup attempt , warned the Turkish army to be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not let NATO get cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ges are in readiness for the Turkish army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
it envis@@ ages lowering legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do this by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media .
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit for race @-@ platform shuttle
over the past few months , over the past few months there has been a dispute over the future of the race gate - now it is supposed to be quite fast .
before the end of the year , the mar@@ o@@ del track , where the tourist train runs , is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the race gate in the long term , construction work on the circuit should start again this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this connection , particularly for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Minister of Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost for the repair of the route was estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
by this sum , the country assumes 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , is currently conclu@@ sively agreed , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia railway as operators are already agreed with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race rigi@@ g shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested to determine whether the route is used by enough people to re @-@ order them in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly b@@ auf@@ ol@@ lig .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are at the moment a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor for Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking their ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern exp@@ ir@@ ators have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a Step@@ ford woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern exp@@ ir@@ ators have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ end@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as much as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ usion to rape , when one goes a step on fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is compatible with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men then have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
their emergence and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will , of course , do not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R announces their increasing popularity , they remain on the ver@@ ge of consum@@ er@@ ism .
but what is tran@@ se@@ ded from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly evolved sex robots emerge in a time where the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most start@@ ling aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the ej@@ ected eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , im@@ itating the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to their personalities , the robots are not real women .
they can &apos;t separate themselves from their companion or simply move away .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing suggest@@ ing independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : maid
b@@ umps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ ce of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that have polar@@ ised U.S. elec@@ torate have split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we all pur@@ port@@ edly recommend us to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ ump to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a le@@ ft@@ ward poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the repub@@ li@@ can kin@@ ship , with which she had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and completely on the same side .
for the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the strength to push all of us to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be thrown off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to tr@@ ump in fact a very mild off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York car parks , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the kli@@ m@@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not entirely over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact no Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Top@@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , during this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to balance the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation that is not necessary .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically gr@@ ins@@ ing while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was hospit@@ alized because of the treatment of cuts to his wrist , according to the prison authorities in a case in his cell .
he was convic@@ ted of murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp during the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der that hid herself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to present this time against the six @-@ year prison term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Office said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ four@@ ths of the F@@ eds and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into holidays and secondary schools .
three of them will go to secondary school in future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of school release , the 29 pupils of the four classes , under the leadership of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eag@@ les grown up in the chi@@ ckens yard , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this the m@@ lower band introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the P@@ ick Farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from its chi@@ ckens .
instead of chi@@ ckens a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it was broken , and the eagle wi@@ ped out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
then the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les that bore cylinders to make the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belonged to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ million@@ aire that he feels accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a letter of thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , the former head of the school , Michael Müller , who always succ@@ eeds in teaching school passes , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber time is over , declared class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , they only leave their students very reluct@@ ant because it was a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ four@@ ths . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end , all students finished a song of summer time and holiday time .
there was great joy with the children .
eight new entries have already been registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television , was informed .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally rolling people was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have sharpen@@ ed control of the free camp and lay down to anyone found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
they are intended to improve exhaust behavior of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates will only apply to the vehicles that have the Schum@@ an Software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) has ordered its retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced quick implementation in the coming months , but not yet known as an exact date .
Daimler has reported to write to any person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done in its framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions take a total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntary actors do not act voluntarily on the subject of environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers do who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE will advise you to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but even in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
so far there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J gets Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the lau@@ re@@ ate Le@@ ar , who has become known with progressive TV series , already announced that it would not be part of the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that weighs on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use the conversation with tr@@ ump to make clear her vision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kennedy Centre named after the former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - but suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker has been mayor of Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work always makes him great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press talk .
he reports about varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprised that no application has been made to fulfil the requirements profile so far .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
in this way - considering the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time to be prepared .
since Has@@ lach functions as a sub@@ contracting authority for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant must present the relevant conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere and good mood among the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the resh@@ aping of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ ven parking lot have been initiated .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will cost about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a master builder of great le@@ e@@ way .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and hor@@ ti@@ culture can be re@@ acted flexibly to many things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the old town as an ensemble is listed as a historic monument , it is important to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going City Buil@@ der emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the City Buil@@ der has a high level of responsibility anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for the past 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , you should be able to present a completed course of studies as a diploma engineer or bach@@ elor with subject architecture according to information from the town of Has@@ lach and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of construction planning and construction planning law .
the municipal building department is subject to high and low construction , construction planning , basic exploitation , administration of urban properties , urban depot with Bau@@ hof and urban gardening as well as the Lower House of Building Law , including the preservation of historic monuments .
bike on lines thrown : Süd@@ bahnhof blocked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle on the lines in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and are looking for them since the night hours .
a pink sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed near the scene of the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a lot of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator would have brought himself into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation as well as the delay and the costs of the rail @-@ replacement traffic , P@@ ön@@ alen of the railway customers could also come to the offen@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , to go out of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be led without disabilities .
just under ten people had failed Friday morning , two of them were concerned about the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall out , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells pat@@ rol in the bow@@ el to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the balance tends to too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice carries a particular bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their diet the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a nutrition intoler@@ ant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system also s@@ wir@@ ls with humans .
post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was accommodated separately , did not have this .
it suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omas of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of mice were sequ@@ enced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with immune cells , but without them in mice .
mice were treated in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria applied to the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i started to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us are protecting L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; genius &quot;
Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , he believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid @-@ field player had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid ki@@ cked off on Tuesday , and impressed in the pen role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , the blues had been excluded from the pre @-@ Asian tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the premi@@ er league season .
&quot; he takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority re @-@ commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be on the radar screens .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such an advertisement earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
how the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
the most important wish of the election champi@@ ons was merely a bon@@ fire from the party headquarters , but not an opposite wind from the League .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals with a growing horror .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
they were deep set@@ backs .
one after the other .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once more shows : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fac@@ ignation of a Gre@@ ens dep@@ u@@ ties has thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Parliament elections , its red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the seclu@@ ded Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ jackets to give her back her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal CEO and election campaign leader of the Green Party Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election champion si@@ gh@@ ed when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority following the aband@@ on@@ ment of the green dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades were paci@@ fied at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
then it became - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a do@@ ve , the Düsseldorf @-@ bankrupt@@ cy sli@@ pped the party smoothly .
in the weeks after that , the comrades were pain@@ stak@@ ingly ped@@ d@@ ling .
then , when they had just taken new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next deep @-@ heart@@ beat .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader in the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communications he did everything wrong with what you can do wrong .
Schol@@ z has since been fighting for its political survival .
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for some time now .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just for that reason , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the im@@ partial co@@ er@@ cion of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Mr Schulz did not at all .
in the meantime , comrades , the comrades try to keep their ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the revol@@ ting parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic as Mrs. T@@ ests puts her own career choices over the interests of everyone else , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Bundestag faction , the Editorial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ v@@ ests was not elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate but on the country list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , so the Lower Saxony dep@@ u@@ ties continued .
the logical consequence would be that they return their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , compla@@ ins of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters four years ago were clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for the clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
grants for local politicians III
who wants to rehabil@@ itate his own house in the years , can soon receive support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been rehabilitation areas in general .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the restructuring area II from 2005 to 2016 the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the present re@@ productions are a &quot; success project &quot; - after all , it is important to promote interior development , not only to open up new building areas .
on 4 April one received the information from the Karlsruhe Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe , that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the sum of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 euro from the country , the rest of the municipality of sens@@ ations .
how is a rehabilitation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will continue to study so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is interest in general .
if necessary , the area boundaries could then be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening , the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per property .
the restructuring area would then be defined as a statute .
the funding period for funding runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , it would only be possible to take stock of the stock , in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the statute of the sentence should be carried out as soon as possible so that the re@@ struc@@ tions can be started in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every Commune had to carry out the said advance examinations .
the aim is to evaluate and decide when it will be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
it is also included in the land register for the respective property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come to his own feelings and get a picture of the situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Property Bo@@ at &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which includes , among other things , the structural condition and the renovation intentions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bud@@ get@@ ary and H@@ ousing Ar@@ rows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Betriebs@@ bogen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphasized that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - first comes first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no funding for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reser@@ ving &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a rehabilitation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to come home and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through their company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the data of the military , which were left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American building programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior White House officials made a tour through products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter made in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was exhibited beside a Ma@@ ine yacht , a fire@@ fighter car from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office required the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy commander of the aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original air crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .
the recordings made available from the TI@@ ME were not clear whether a second crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could violate the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commander wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes .
pres@@ idents are required to use them for travel .
but challenging its use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential plane was in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predec@@ essors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often conduct training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to offset US President at the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted in the training needs of the air crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a Si@@ kor@@ sky spokes@@ man said the company was not involved to exhibit the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget@@ ing records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study in 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract termination .
at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
the runner @-@ up of the Second tennis league will compete at the stand@@ ings of the S@@ V stand@@ ings .
TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss joins the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel .
despite five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis League won the sense of reality .
Team Director Mari@@ us Z@@ ay at any rate has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the rear positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , especially the imports from the high North take care of .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a look at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be difficult for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is convenient .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was really happy when he signed his signature under the law for tightening the sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Congress packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US thrust .
at the same time , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then , investors of the O@@ MV , which together with other European firms have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership North Stream 2 , are correspon@@ dingly worried .
the threat of dr@@ one is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump even had to bring the sanctions to life by Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the hit series of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet .
the seasons three and four were confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bu@@ cks of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i cart@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .

role backward : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch @-@ table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock will be turned back in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers .
on 1st September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director in the field of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooking will continue to be cooked except for the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked ch@@ illed .
the city operates in the Kre@@ feld region 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last kit@@ eline year 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need grew steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 days of the week are at lunch in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 partial @-@ time staff from the 1st September kitchen service : they heat up the delivered meals , add salad , raw food and fruit , divide the meal individually , give the food out , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as rough rough facilities - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign allocation for the city as the most economical one , it is said from the press office .
and that , although 46 partial @-@ time forces are read@@ just@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight at about 750 people in the education area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting leader of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are candidates in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Tali@@ ban has published threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will hand over the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of registered 3.6 million voters .

two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who stood up with friends on the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2 : 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .

the two young men could later be arrested by the police .

G@@ MB concern about investing in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union wants to wi@@ den the long @-@ term commitment to production at their plant in Glas@@ gow by managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said the company out@@ weighed the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which , in addition to other products , makes hobby and rich tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first to experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s hopes that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity from general site managers about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate strongly on the local community and the Greater Glas@@ gow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of workplaces , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a manufacturing facility fully and completely . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not fail in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after giving up an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record raid ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous one , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional athletes in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out to the outside , although a spring near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always done his best to take care of him since he arrived from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
as Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players in PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old was travelling from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane so that he had to turn right .

interview : &quot; Cathedral scra@@ per report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; declared after publication to the German press agency , he expected from former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes .
on the other hand , the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that when reporting about violence in the cathedral cats , &quot; double standards &quot; were measured .
in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ ler@@ ia , Histori@@ an and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee , was con@@ spic@@ uous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ abe@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and that &apos;s a fe@@ ather@@ ed feeding . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strokes were a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with nau@@ ghty children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , Pope Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says E@@ zek@@ iah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ? Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were subjected to high plau@@ sibility between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , 67 dom@@ ed cats sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
however , in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
in the interview , E@@ zek@@ iah explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence Ex@@ erc@@ ise at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of George R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students raise his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which has become pal@@ p@@ able to the gre@@ ener if a dome set didn &apos;t produce top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as a bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is common in it .
he has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exemp@@ li@@ fied from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the primary school took place outside of his sphere of influence .
one can at best pre@@ tend to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough .
the gymn@@ as@@ tics gymn@@ asi@@ um on which he worked was felt by virtually all the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es - literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger exhibits an excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly fed the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to wound out@@ breaks .
the fact that he did not only craw@@ l with chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the ground , but also distributed ear @-@ cow@@ ards and attracted too nau@@ ghty boys to the hair or ears , he has granted himself already years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that .
to his rescue , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the early 1960s and 1970s , in parents and in teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think every one of us was born in 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what it actually goes in this report , namely the horrible sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are , of course , Bag@@ at@@ ella .
one wonders whether it is not related to his famili@@ arity and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just pl@@ ung@@ ed into him .
many who have never understood him at the Bavarian pop@@ e still work eag@@ erly .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , much talked about the subject of abuse among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also put in the final report any involvement or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claim to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one affected person representing the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally in a certain way .
how do the cath@@ ed@@ r@@ als students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a questioned student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had a timely understanding and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
I think it is absurd to assume that it is reck@@ oned to be ... Bu@@ ben intru@@ sive or clearer or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc .
that one talks about sex with him ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report concludes with a clear conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any co @-@ knowledge .
he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the display .
therefore , there is no reason to link his good name to these in@@ war@@ dly crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen had to be read . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed up in the coverage and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere , in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is again an abuse of the report .
there is a clear separation between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the dom@@ ine@@ ties , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let &apos;s say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report treats incidents from time since 1945 , thus also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the cathedral spar@@ rows .
the whole horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were legi@@ tim@@ ately har@@ assed and terri@@ fied , all at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the throne gymn@@ asi@@ um .
on the one hand , as most of the witnesses stress , the topic of &quot; primary school &quot; is t@@ abo@@ o .
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise @-@ like &quot; conditions .
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to have stolen away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states of the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible ( as the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then back to 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently close the ears before the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um , which even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the test penalty is still practi@@ sed in the pre @-@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as test pen@@ alties were also banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they took action in a legal grey zone , as each of us is still aware of .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been crossed .
but it is not possible to say that he had always looked away .
that &apos;s just not true .
it was only in 1980 that the death penalty in schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time at that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael H@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of evaluating past moral standards .
the princess was right there .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and also not for what was blin@@ ded in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual .
it &apos;s all terrible and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger must take shelter , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , having ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he was strictly adher@@ ed to .
what picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit has shown Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ?
did the subject of check punishment also come to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI tells from his perspective , there the dome cats only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not at all reject that he carried out a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , one does not even make a big singer from rebel@@ li@@ ous boys and stand before every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during talks with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I &apos;ve met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic @-@ good , deeply @-@ believing and heart@@ felt people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something for a fly .
I regularly get in touch with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , 23 years after his detention , regularly hold contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect person , to whom they still look up and who ad@@ ore them .
and , please , once again clearly : all that is acc@@ ru@@ ed to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have long ago overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is only too obvious the evil intention behind it .
the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the cler@@ k would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and probably Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
