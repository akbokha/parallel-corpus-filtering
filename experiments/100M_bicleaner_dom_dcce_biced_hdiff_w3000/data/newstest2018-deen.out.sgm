<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners are cultivating the former foundation of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich makes exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that, who had to get upset, because the car-navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Bavarian State Government, are anything but up-to-date - yet very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickenteppme, which one recognizes as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "in the large overview map, detailed maps, so-called" "" "Urposition sheets" "", "were incorporated for cities and municipalities." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bavarian surveying authorities between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French commander occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops finally removed the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, the present neighbors, who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The original sheet for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subsendling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was built 21 years after the drawing up of the map, i.e. in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered flurpieces from the so-called "original recording" from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots now occupy no more farmers - but small farmers in the "Land in the Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October quests, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or from the hill" "" "On the ventilation" "" "- but also in big letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the cigarettes of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibits the personnel from applying force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, and later on 500 places were extended.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalsirary facility in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of Germany's biggest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in the Munich Salesianum on the premises of the former institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex and turned it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the football field of the TSV München East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in an architectural resemblance to the original building of the Irrenanstalt which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main square" "" "around 1856, the shopping street was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombs broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt from the Middle Ages once stood at Marienhof, where these days are the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory politics and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will come into force until 28 August 2017, asks afro-american travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention while travelling by the state, as a series of questionable, race-based incidents can be found throughout the country and can be noted here," says the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to discriminate against discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, which disproportionately targets minorities, prompted the group to release the warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist offense against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the voyage and was put into custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recently published report by the Missouri Office of Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state are stopped by 75 percent more often than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready to have a deposit money or let the relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI hate crime report, which classify the state regarding the number of such violations in the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had adopted immigration laws that would oblige local prosecution authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to the further racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidefence project is a project of success and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac made a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fishermen's CDU town association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the pivot yard of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, in which he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of woodland, 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and home in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is the alternative marketing way for him for the milk of his cows," "" "says Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste there is only regionals.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also chairman of the" "" "BLHV Chairman" "", "he described the electric fence project as" "" "elementary importance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I can't manage on such steep areas profitably." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space ensures a lot of work, much has to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he did not conduct bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader's support."</seg>
<seg id="80">With a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion." ""</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of open-maintenance amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be explored until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 euros were promoted by leader, a quarter bore the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained twelve 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," says Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job without farmers and rural women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiß, too, said: "here the best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape-care line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a scholarship specified by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be protracted must not be minppery (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must thus be threatened with forestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fischbacher Weidezhen project 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build a fence of 16 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="96">The accounting area equals 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate them as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imiteers would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took hold of its importance, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually right, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your wearies, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, and the wretched rubbish of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not get involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had taken up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a depiction of the classical visual representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great scribe Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world: Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not light the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is rather unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrific journeys on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is all about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would like to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch will not light the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power will ignite.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butsch - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m stretch, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team for team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, competing in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scotsmen are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best overall athlete at the World Championship was seven, which have been reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance runner Muir leads along this road and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>

<seg id="150">The team captain says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team mates have voted for me and chose me, it makes something special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="155">As to my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the inheating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from home affairs to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shrank with criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">"" "" "" "and the American Civil Liberties Union accused him therefore at the beginning of this week." ""</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash response with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if there is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to lose his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of people coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially called and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and non-profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other latest news," "" "she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't really appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same topic, they are more likely to be regarded as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the governor's staff designated as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call others" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical columnists and to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what is happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain overcame his ministry, according to historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put them into silence.</seg>

<seg id="250">In its wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai rule in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.</seg>
<seg id="251">After half an hour, the charcoal tuber is removed and engulfed with zealous, unwashed hands.</seg>

<seg id="258">It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were voted by a public raise in front of the occupying forces.</seg>
<seg id="259">An existing movement that stirred up the independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, who maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.</seg>

<seg id="270">But it is also Indonesia's gold country.</seg>
<seg id="271">The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a high-land province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="272">In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="273">In addition, Papua has wood resources valued at an estimated $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="274">These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military keeps a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military operations and units almost $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer.</seg>

<seg id="349">Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to this, thousands of people were arrested and arbitrarily arrested in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>

<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>

<seg id="358">They keep most of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">In the course of time economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nabire airport.</seg>

<seg id="365">In addition, restrictions on the coverage of international media remain tense.</seg>
<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua-Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although the rare permission to film was given to them.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokai's election campaign to raise restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.</seg>

<seg id="407">A survey conducted on air passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously forbidden items were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, among them at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft while they accidentally wore banned knives or other items with blades.</seg>
<seg id="408">Less than 1 per cent claimed that they were late discovered that they were mistakenly shot with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey conducted at more than 1,000 people, carried out by a Jet Charter Service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers were more likely to disregard the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Those surveyed admitted that they have knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, were 19.7 percent millennials compared to less than 15 percent, the members of Generation X were.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common objects deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and fluids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent admitted to have knowingly carried items with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female interviewees and 3.7 percent of the male interviewees also confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs into the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidently had smuggled smuggled goods through the airport security and how many had intentionally done it.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that the people who wear the best smuggling ware - knowingly or unknowingly - carry through security, those who fly most frequently.</seg>
<seg id="415">The company points out, however, that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="416">People are often unsure what kind of fluids they are allowed to carry or how much of it.</seg>

<seg id="421">Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to display the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla Model 3.</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far suggested that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever-triumphant numbers of sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed a different, less glittering figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: the reversal of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">Over the past few months, Musk has often advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just begins.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: from the total of 518,000 orders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics always pointed out that it is only a matter of non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Pounds) "Reservation."</seg>
<seg id="428">Currently 45,000 such non-binding reservations stipulate, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018 it is said that all models will be 500,000, one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are 1800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a "Model 3" can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive his brand new, never-tested production lines without major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">If it comes to greater delays, then the unbinding of the reservations may become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="440">A day after he had been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions of smoke-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities as compared to previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint which had been lodged against his previous position in a Federal Labour Court.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is about a period that went on October 1 for States to comply with the standards set out by Ozone in 2015." ""</seg>

<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was appointed by Donald Trump Attorney General of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly crossed over to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the most recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Employment Court in Washington has decided that the EPA administrator exceeded its authority when trying to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>

<seg id="450">"" "" "" "in earlier administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement set the date for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive reconstitution of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche the old graveyard area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16 July.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Beneficent Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the place have made friends and promoters Tumlingens their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini emphasizes:" "" "it is a unique village jewel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the S. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Urcustomizable book: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the word of the deed, on the Hill of Tumour, besides the former parish church, there was also a magnificent court to which the Church or the patron of the patron belonged to and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, besides the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village-picture of Tumlingen, the "mountain" is the third, the manorial settlement-centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 confirm these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, equipped and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this own church.</seg>
<seg id="478">In this way, the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two crushed on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell then rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead out of listeners.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Church of Hilarius was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm split the steeple and half fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the Turmzwerg existing today remained a witness to the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"" "today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius system from the" "" "sheep retired" "" "as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn." ""</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, the Friends and Donors invite Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade on the old graveyard to St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann is talking about the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "Boisheim defends itself" "" "does not see a legal requirement for construction and therefore has turned to the councillor." ""</seg>
<seg id="506">"" "the" "" "Boisheim" "" "association has called upon Councillor Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen only at the border to Schwalmtal there is a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the urban area.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent a "recess" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">The town of Viersen had decided a second wind-force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette only a few days earlier - but the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve of a mould failure.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning law, the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also to take back," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim." ""</seg>
<seg id="513">State-of-the-art status: before the summer break, the City Council once again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>

<seg id="519">"" "with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argument of the association" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build on an area at the Boisheim Nette the construction of four wind turbines each 200 metres high.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is involved, had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11,400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seater households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday a seven-tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"we are very good at the time, it runs great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Traffic and Transport at the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, work began at the same time on all three bridge bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be met.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch arch bridge made of concrete, clad with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are built of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long respectively.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning got a 1.30 m wide and seven tons so-called bridge cap on the northern side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fixation that is also used as operating mode.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2,20 m wide bridge cap should be inserted on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian path is to be lost.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about it is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach requires a special feeling of intuition.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Furthermore, fish and crustaceans had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard building and the collection point in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is controlled in one lane by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully locked.</seg>
<seg id="929">The costs for the three bridgeings amount to 700 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="948">In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Stork to hold their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but so far, the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">A little more than an hour takes the AfD event, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is announced shortly after 21 o'clock.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules that have been launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make money loose with security in order to sign Neymar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but they have to interact with legitimate sources of income that allow them to reach the break-even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini for his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the club debts to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini died in 2015 from the Presidency of the Presidency, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare off from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely, FFP is not dead and we will definitely enhance the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption rate for the next five years can be stated in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (back then 82 million dollars), which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs trying to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar World Cup ambassadors will be and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be more attentive, try every attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent Neymars move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding the last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1159">For the past few years, Chocolat Frey Board has made board chocolate for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet cooperation is ahead of a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>

<seg id="1166">Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to "North West Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more importantly the advertising effect is: for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are interested in the new call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss has been distributing chocolate tablets since 2006 on board their flights.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Prior to closing a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">Swiss introduced the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of co-operation with Chocolat Frey.</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like the time would be short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"" "" "" "first Day of Camp" "" "worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humors (it contained a primal story for a promising tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin)." ""</seg>

<seg id="1190">One point sticks to a character through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-vicious plot included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the excourses are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd who shows Matt Dillons's sublippenbart of "Singles," whose ex-man-on-camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random madness that could incite this franchise like a sort of repeating "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang how to visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now remembers a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-west ring-combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates that a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues are synced by Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>

<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so very committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"" "" "" "Comrade Detective" "" "which was edited on a lower length could better deliver his Agitprop satire since Gregory and Iosef are always visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a heap of hamburgers." ""</seg>

<seg id="1210">Attack on drugs mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police managed to hit the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor's office Konstanz announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the officers ensured greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">In the case of time-consuming raids in Italy two people were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects Italians, there were German arrest warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore probably shipped to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators participated in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of more than 300 police officers were in action.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The Mafia members are accused of organised drug crimes, severe acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz has been investigating the trafficking of drugs in southern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Therefore the big effort on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bank with a real estate passion, reduced himself from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot large apartment was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, room and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it seem longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous room the beauty of the living room can lock up the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went in," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is mutual, so that when you lift the door, it slides very lightly." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," "" "said Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that touch and which help create emotional ties in a home," "" "said Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of something standard in something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate-empire Victorias worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood since 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, Brunswick and Sorrento's development areas, apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.</seg>

<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>

<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise, with hundreds of sites with affiridavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops in the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They made use of the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeansshop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with her sons.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met with executive staff on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that has fallen into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing," "" "said the former election campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trump Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, insists that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trump Twitter was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don't know others - that Trump Tweets would not have contained any more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never experience something about the tweets that trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his co-workers manage to keep away from it a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of advisers to provide the President with questionable information for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former dump officials say that trump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he insists on finding out where they originate from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy secretary of Staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicans, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence, or that he has voiced wrong accusations in the past and revoke them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldsmith added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1447">That's good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof at the then Ambiente Rheingesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year as well as income from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the district, the hotel building offered to the district council as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers from deploying a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the location of the hotel and already spoke of serious interested people at the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the representation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his collaborators.</seg>

<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelven.</seg>
<seg id="1528">The ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It always grows further into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">At the north of this horseshoe, the equilibrium of waxes and breakdowns was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete pee-file there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-pee-file is in danger, because the front edge has never been pulled back as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can crumble if a piece abrupts at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of Schelfeits and Eisberg does not raise sea level because they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the horseshoe leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a limited extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeits is the fourth biggest horseshoe of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the widest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists it is contested whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeits will be growing again or in the long run and possibly coincide, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers do not bring back the demolition of this giant iceberg to climate change, many of the polar regions of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long crest of the Antarctic extends to South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the British Antarctic Survey research program, the polar area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and thus enumerates the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant jobs, the CDU calls to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, 41 new vacancies in the administration were linked.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have left their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The courses at the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications for the places to be allocated this year were to be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the group is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are still 50 unoccupied places by the Mettmann circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general management are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU would now like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the request of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recovery and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orient internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-climbers and include an education offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other towns advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a real" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This involves a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">Thus high time for action so that not even more jobs will remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU Group, goes beyond the joint application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long been in the circle of circles for a bad surprise when he publicly challenged personnel costs and baffled the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association." ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfying solution in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in co-operation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a hoary rate," "" "said peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials than it actually envisages the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Salaries are currently prescribed exactly, increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown increasingly over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostituting protection law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, councillor Thomas Hendele and Regional Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy aggravates the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they are not allowed to continue if they do not abide by new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "" "said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat by the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to give detailed proposals to the Italian public prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in an opinion on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only assess all accusations currently collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that his crew takes on board dinghy migrants who are delivered to them directly from dealers, and that smugglers can depart for the ships to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed so far to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" "" "essential changes or disabilities" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel Peace Prize organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Meanwhile, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Anstiege and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine wismers Biker, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the North-Palatinate to enjoy Trials and sightseeings for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Wine Festival from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">Observation points followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents for the long trials.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the folk festival sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"" "again, a lookout spot on the lookout spot, connected by" "" "flowige" "" "trials and moderate ascents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced.</seg>

<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled curative brine in the open air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga is equipping for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium ramps in wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">"" "" "" "we have also recognised the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field." ""</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds apart from the fact that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract one could be far more often present on these markets online than to send the German ligament to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In e-sport, computer games such as League Of Legends, "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA Cup simulation will be fought at competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long since established themselves, in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And e-sport is already part of the official program for the Asian games 2022.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is this a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobo also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport, because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classical sports - such as increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction to reaction.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW stated that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW chairman said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options as travel restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - banning or restricting diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a callback.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The costs for automakers to install systems for the neutralisation of exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of hiring the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes which could regulate the use of so-called depreciation equipment that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were indicted and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to trial in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen once the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions legislation in Europe, and a request focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously dampen Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining due to the drought-reminding conditions and insect-borne insects, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the service life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zikade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly paper Riodosius usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for coverage of the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals making the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Riodosius, the co-founder Javier Valdez cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodosius Building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Special Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders committed every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodosius they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolent and even though the terrain is even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we distrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodosius in the province capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times, probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-storeyed mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "calm" "" "when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodosius, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February, there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue when it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper published by the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues for the foundation of Riodosius and sold 50 US dollars holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without hitting the drug poison problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved publishing hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "" "Maria-moors-Cabot Award" "" "for her coverage in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodolce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who could curtail like a dockworker, a friend who was generously embraced with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love of routine his ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best they can do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>

<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the Feodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodosius met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodosius in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself did not call trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went to the mountain scenery, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodosius made three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé on the state expenditures concentrated on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, through a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone knows in town: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because their employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped up a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder throughout the country by defeating them in organized protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked for her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her fury has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that in Mexico journalists were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a valid society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earthworks.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinking your eyes, you could almost believe that it was sleeping," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used an shielding technique known as counter-insult, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to blend better in its surroundings and avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to detect it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armors over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs were driven from sufficient pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predatory behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores of the Cretaceous period have been," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal for clues about his life, including his conserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>

<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian precinct has been splitting the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, of which also the other shops benefit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly identical - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst forfeited a 35-year prison sentence after having publicly disclosed diplomatic reports about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Through algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data, the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted for 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grained black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette blunt and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal to Briefferonds who exchanged multiple letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President of Chelsea would convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and heavy at the opening of the exhibition, because Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable paths to flaming up the rigid splits which it should actually remedy.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things after the strange timing, she said that "things happen for a specific reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation was gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully take away is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic-novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she emerges from the discipline barracks of the United States like King Kong with a hands-on telephone.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they keep your speech, they won," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "so never stop your mouth." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacrum, which together like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also goal-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the website of the Organization.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next user</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Responses were often vague, little helpful or - worse - cheating.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not dare the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there has never been consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-ups race is at growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, provide special groups and demographics groups, to provide staff anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap polls and polls of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low consent results - so you can reboot why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won't be the next Uber involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as GLINT, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the finanzechnical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent GmbH lets companies send tailored "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the Court of Public Opinion has grasped the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and lawsuits, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and processes and have an easy way to reach their headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - like discrimination, harassment or unfair practic- can be identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical breaches due to the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media" "" "came to their right," "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry went online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service, and debit the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"when people are happy to be in a company that's their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach yields when their portfolio companies run well. companies are running well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company take no action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotify employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4.000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have committed too much to collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow people, ask yourself," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about it, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after the gathering of feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to re-organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday the company gets new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better engagement of employees in a sector that is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says." ""</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only reacted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "" "" "this is his thumb print!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome-greeting") seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape painters, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "Whiskey" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only got full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the period of English Empires, cards that represent what possessed: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go their way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to plunge into English history on a broader base, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "" "" "there is a record of a riot that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," "" "Rhodes says." ""</seg>

<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is depicted in the 18th century, who stages his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug out).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford.</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) consults in Ankara about retirement and carriage in the officer corps.</seg>

<seg id="2343">The five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2344">As a result, the civilians in the YAS were in the headcount.</seg>

<seg id="2346">Although Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the forces of air and the navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan was fired in 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees the Erdogan as a wire-puller for the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are at the moment a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," "" "Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern expirators have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot via the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a Stepford woman progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern expirators have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed figures such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as much as possible," enthuses the True Companion website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusion to rape, when one goes a step on frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, disturb one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy is compatible with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men then have Roxxxy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will, of course, do not hold sex robots, and while the FRR announces their increasing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumerism.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is transeded from the boundary zones can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly evolved sex robots emerge in a time where the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most startling aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the ejected eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, imitating the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to their personalities, the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can't separate themselves from their companion or simply move away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing suggesting independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the language of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Bumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truce of the Trump-era that the political divisions that have polarised U.S. electorate have split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all purportedly recommend us to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trump to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftward poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican kinship, with which she had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and completely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the strength to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be thrown off." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as an epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both compared to trump in fact a very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York car parks, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the klimpering music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not entirely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the TopPub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to balance the evaluation with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation that is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologetically grinsing while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was hospitalized because of the treatment of cuts to his wrist, according to the prison authorities in a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">He was convicted of murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp during the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nightly intruder that hid herself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to present this time against the six-year prison term of Pistorius Appell, from which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Prosecution Office said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells patrol in the bowel to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance tends to too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice carries a particular bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a nutrition intolerant to tryptophan promotes less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system also swirls with humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was accommodated separately, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiomas of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of mice were sequenced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with immune cells, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were treated in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria applied to the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri started to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us are protecting L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not fail in its persecution of Neymar after giving up an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record raid?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous one, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional athletes in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out to the outside, although a spring near the Catalans board insists that the club has always done his best to take care of him since he arrived from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="2870">As Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players in PSG.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Cathedral scraper report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche," declared after publication to the German press agency, he expected from former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false appraisal of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">On the other hand, the Vatican paper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that when reporting about violence in the cathedral cats, "double standards" were measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scarleria, Historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee, was conspicuous.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of denying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scarabeia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we like to go to the church and that's a feathered feeding."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "strokes were a very normal educational tool" "", "" "" "to cope with naughty children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the misuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the "My brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Ezekiah," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment? Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were subjected to high plausibility between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, 67 domed cats sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Ezekiah explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburger Domspatzen, Georg Ratzinger, is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "Incidents of Violence Exercise at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "", "gives a contradictory picture of George Ratzinger's Domkapellmeister." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "on the one hand, many students raise his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as choleric and perfectionist, which has become palpable to the greener if a dome set didn't produce top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is common in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exemplified from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the primary school took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can at best pretend to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The gymnastics gymnasium on which he worked was felt by virtually all the interviewees - literally - "salvation," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger exhibits an excellent testimony, describes him as "warm," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as a very good-natured teacher who regularly fed the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to wound outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only crawl with chairs and threw the keychain on the ground, but also distributed ear-cowards and attracted too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he has granted himself already years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his rescue, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the early 1960s and 1970s, in parents and in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually goes in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, these are, of course, Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not related to his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just plunged into him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him at the Bavarian pope still work eagerly.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, much talked about the subject of abuse among the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also put in the final report any involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claim to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one affected person representing the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then definitely not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally in a certain way.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the cathedrals students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had a timely understanding and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it is absurd to assume that it is reckoned to be... Buben intrusive or clearer or even more open than to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks about sex with him... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "the report concludes with a clear conclusion:" "" "that the students and / or their environment affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any co-knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to link his good name to these inwardly crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen had to be read." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed up in the coverage and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is again an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clear separation between the pre-school and the high school of the domineties, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let's say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report treats incidents from time since 1945, thus also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the cathedral sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were legitimately harassed and terrified, all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the throne gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the one hand, as most of the witnesses stress, the topic of "primary school" is taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise-like" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">In this way, at the most, the accusation remains to have stolen away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states of the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible (as the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then back to 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymnasium gymnasium, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out," "" "that the test penalty is still practised in the pre-school." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as test penalties were also banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took action in a legal grey zone, as each of us is still aware of.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit had been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But it is not possible to say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the death penalty in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hemann: we historians are talking about the "pitfall of anachronism," that is, the danger of evaluating past moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what was blinded in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all terrible and I'm glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time Georg Ratzinger must take shelter, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, having ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he was strictly adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his Regensburger Zeit has shown Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of check punishment also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI tells from his perspective, there the dome cats only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all reject that he carried out a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one does not even make a big singer from rebellious boys and stand before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I've met Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic-good, deeply-believing and heartfelt people, from whom you can't imagine that he could only do something for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspatzen, 23 years after his detention, regularly hold contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect person, to whom they still look up and who adore them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And, please, once again clearly: all that is accrued to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long ago overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is only too obvious the evil intention behind it.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The report, which was just published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the clerk would command a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and probably Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
