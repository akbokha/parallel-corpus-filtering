28 @-@ year @-@ old Koch found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the corp@@ se found in West@@ field Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations were underway .
brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia announced that Frank first lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the things for him finally went up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to connect his species with his family was to cook us always something to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond shining brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information to the case will be asked to invo@@ ke the message of the S@@ F@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hollywood star has now clearly made it clear in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be put in drawers or glued on the outside label that has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself have no desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather a sn@@ u@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan .
the act@@ ress most likes to spend their time at home , vor@@ m television with loose de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the White @-@ gl@@ ut , she asks the question of the children &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her new film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not Child Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film runs with us on August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of di@@ version with some colleagues at the beach .
for the 58 year old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted in fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to feed trou@@ ghs .
one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and thus the riding career ended again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 victories - again close to horses .
he had his family run over the system of AL@@ RV , and he didn &apos;t even shoot himself for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen under a small gala the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid .
the symp@@ a@@ thetic sports@@ man does not lack ac@@ col@@ ades .
silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid was long .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been fo@@ stering the offspring .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following are the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the Rwand@@ an Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ rider Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the show jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um@@ ously the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - that is both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are , however , in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep it small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely go back to regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , he has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why the taxes for the rich would be increased , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the U.S. , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost immediately .
the democratic applicant even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical tea party wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so there could be no party @-@ internal discussion on tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ launch the coal mining in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement he wants to cancel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , with its investment programme , Clinton explicitly wants to expand renewable energy and demand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , both competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the Tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ lian trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply better protect American jobs .
they are to be paid even better , called Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says that the minimum wage has to be r@@ att@@ led , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop rather than the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth .
his critics prec@@ lu@@ de him , so the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least of the rich , wants that they pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house provides refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he glan@@ ces curi@@ ously in the room with great eyes .
his mother gaz@@ es on the table top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - either as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope ministers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for their escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they cannot see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experienced sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , kill@@ ings , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is no r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end , as soon as they acc@@ ede to Germany , is ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that about 90 percent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they do not dare to speak openly about what they experienced because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they often do not know how to help , there are more accommodations just for them , B@@ ahr calls .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence , some answer no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in the housing of governments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man for the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are stor@@ eys or houses in some common homes only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or become men and women together , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read in the rush they are giving to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have spoken about that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily set up a second house .
general practitioners strike : demands for new work @-@ fighting measures
representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more operations from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers had planned to deal with the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members , who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was released on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; had problems , which led to the rejection of the treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and requ@@ esting official re @-@ negotiations with all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating working combat measures that begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes resulted in the fact that assistance doctors made six times striking this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Assistance Physi@@ cians , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance doctors and medical students , that the contract should be advantageous and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced in force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants the most to be reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be sli@@ pper@@ y and he had hardly any heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper describing that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved like this would never happen .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but a sustainable cool@@ ness eman@@ ating from Putin showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the firing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to that time was rage .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
it was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
setting up the c@@ ous@@ ins becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
the most serious accus@@ ations were that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied that .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire are obvious .
in the first place , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after his last month has been hal@@ ted by a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West because it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer .
in addition , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool sen@@ timent and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West .
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an alliance of out@@ si@@ ders in Russia and Turkey : two countries that have been driven away from the West and treated badly and are now al@@ lied .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said that they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ pped the subject .
the president of Turkey deliberately refra@@ ined from responding to a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize it .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey f@@ lowed the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized headquarters and the stock exchange listing to Nat@@ West are changed .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private client business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I now say that we do not pursue any global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with our customers .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , for how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for clients ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bench for our customers and would have launched these stamps .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .

D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which gives him a 3.@@ 000@@ th prize
Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old is the sixth jo@@ ckey that reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won in front of G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori absor@@ bs the che@@ ering when he clin@@ ches victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who scored more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern world and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already collected 6,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has had almost 30 years of winning in the UK , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve @-@ wra@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties at the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue playing at competitions up to his age of at least 5 .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed Sergei Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s closest mutual trust for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it reads that without giving reasons , Putin has ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked at the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that later he was the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the administration staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding the draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince you ?
this step has made Moscow secret .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ fied Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ns at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this right now .
but the official claim - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president should at once pursue the Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks to Putin quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust compla@@ ining posts for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin reached power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
it was once assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third presidential term would have viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced in a joint statement its dis@@ miss@@ al .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son from the series that follows a team of FB@@ I agents will be published , according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios is expected to be released at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and spent the last twelve years plug@@ ged into my heart blood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will not be possible now .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the scheduled power of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fishing fish could be sand a@@ als that have been sow@@ ed by a fountain .
Mr B@@ ain , who lives at about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle in Per@@ is@@ cope hoping that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ fjord Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of Que@@ ens@@ to cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 obli@@ que ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economics Keith Brown today paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in building Que@@ ens@@ on cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic extent to this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of all bridge de@@ cks are at their place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of trend@@ setting high and low construction .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the side of the land .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive since the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
at the same time , the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - at each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit the alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim , while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and posed the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones rescue station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already taken the boat out of its reach , until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coast @-@ rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have happiness un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this loos@@ ened when the boat was scra@@ pped off from the person who was steering the boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone has watched over these men today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
seriously injured - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend

who is building cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : investors should be obliged to take much stronger duty in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 affordable apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hab@@ itation concept living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is inevitable .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation has been missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments must be furnished as social housing in future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also be built on the continu@@ ance .
however , the main point in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build on such surfaces at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing development program , which will cost millions and still needs to be funded , should provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to introduce investors as little as possible .
the left wants even harder jobs for investors .
despite this , as viol@@ a , there is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is required .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how is it compens@@ ating for the loss of other 1300 affordable apartments , whose extraction will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 flats .
in order to prevent this , so the planning @-@ oriented spokesperson Nicole Palm , now out@@ going connections should be bought from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to return apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in West@@ stadt .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
at the end of the year , Fri@@ sten is running in the West@@ stadt .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again , from the goal of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mixing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go into the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I concentrated on more building sites for single family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside for playing but rather prefer to spend their free time star@@ ing on screens has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created . )
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ emon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; taken prisoner . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger joined the del@@ usion and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person res@@ ig@@ ns every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch that pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , recently notified Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of tra@@ cked people who exercise every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns on health that want to bring people to &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active everyday , &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages are d@@ ull and come from people who look mis@@ erable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always there are also min@@ ers who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos; success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ator in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es Cre@@ ates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
bril@@ li@@ antly brilliant .
and now finally an Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast created a multi @-@ battle title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ ns on the Swedish bar during the solo campaign of women in the arts gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ battle title and is the fifth , while rein@@ forcing its call to be the best of its generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the sport for the last three years - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - winning a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awa@@ ited them a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between their and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other , after they have won gold and silver in the retail competition of women at the Winter Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she retired at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i as ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on having planned the future during their long journey , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no accident .
this girl adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ afa ran through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ei@@ ving .
Swedish beams and floor pe@@ ars - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - was l@@ ur@@ king .
she resum@@ ed again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam again - and still another 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as she expected her final result - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured into bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their ground exercise , she cast down K@@ us@@ sh@@ ände , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in serial kill@@ ings while listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of Phoenix &apos;s most deadly attacks , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he was on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder was not the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y case , as the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two more injured in his@@ panic neighbor@@ hoods within four months in nine cas@@ u@@ alties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
one witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the sho@@ ot@@ ings , which aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a bul@@ let out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage it .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I didn &apos;t let myself go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s wrong at all -- of course , you &apos;ve got into it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to said .
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of age and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he progres@@ ses slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund has chosen for &quot; Please sing me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund invented some notes alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ ka@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect life of infected with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds us of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful counsel for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ all and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected to have more rainf@@ alls all day long .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone would have requested tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while the area of Mobile continued to rain .
the Com@@ ite River near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite close to Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers are only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still shr@@ ank from floo@@ ding in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly overnight .
he said that another step@@ son , who lives near , warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ cked and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told H@@ ans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there never saw such a high level of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread rapidly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning was 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the rainf@@ all has been conclu@@ sive since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and road floods caused the rescu@@ ing of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching staff in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that there were 200 flooded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , both of which were flooded .
the pioneer of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets washed by the flood .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , shel@@ ters were set up to lodge the evacu@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen streets were closed due to the floo@@ ding and provided sand@@ bags for the residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the Municipal Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as flooded , but on Friday no report has been reported .
Keith Tow@@ n@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; out@@ lived sho@@ ot@@ ings in Philadelphia
the police announced that the six @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several violations of the gun , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital with his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was qu@@ en@@ ched by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z told the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that it is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class at a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , shot on , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with the fact that it apparently came to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
rif@@ le shells for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ looked the scene of the crime .
it seems that this was clearly a lasting battle .
on the road , on both sides of the pav@@ ement , were sleeves .
so there seems to be several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said police cler@@ k Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross trainer on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ onship in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I have been involved in each summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three spir@@ es , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who had inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is catho@@ lic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one under the female female was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and the USA che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected yet master@@ ful gy@@ nec@@ tic routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one was the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold at an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t look like gymn@@ as@@ tics in the whole country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female dancers in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are a more expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents who pay for training , set up , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their tur@@ ner and families ) .
the majority of these sne@@ akers are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both of her athletes since they started gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to offer to the communities countless young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access gymn@@ as@@ tics training .
I founded my gym for 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young@@ sters ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the holding of the Olympic team gold and thanks , you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
general practitioners want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance doctors who voted for a vote rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and would be harmful to the staff and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend changes in order to improve the care of hours .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistant doctors announced last night in a message : &quot; assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current occup@@ ancy crisis and will be used to treat all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resol@@ ute resol@@ ving disputes with regard to the government &apos;s reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was done by a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the spirit and address the cares of the assistant doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out other activities .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better weekend remuneration for the 5@@ 4.000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employee , urged the assistance doctors to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; working combat measures do not achieve anything of the only little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , car@@ ers and their families only sorrow , distress and dis@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months , we have talked to the assistant doctors &quot; committee and responded positively to the concerns about tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously the employers , the Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health were concerned with respect to the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ators have recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ators have recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form layers .
if the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged up the blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month ing@@ es@@ tion of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it .
information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture makes election frau@@ ds blo@@ om in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year at the insti@@ g@@ ation of a government report
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to wi@@ ther@@ ingly ignor@@ ing widespread election frau@@ ds in Muslim communities like a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and city coun@@ cils to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to ethnic and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption King , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be allowed by the police to set out shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should carry out identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present a vot@@ er must only name his name and address .
the report suggests not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they release their vote to prevent someone to choose twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves to fight electoral fraud , but also aims to protect the local government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral court decided that the acting mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was to be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner , &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ic duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which one person chooses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud all over the country .
he was particularly alar@@ ming for the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including carrying out ID cards to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as evidence has been indicated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to ethnic and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit letter selection documents to stop &quot; election harvesting . &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the voting directory being used for immigration and social investment purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists edit full brief@@ ings and envel@@ opes from postal elections .
the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs around electoral stations .
a change of law that makes an accus@@ ation easier for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in electoral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters alone go into the voting cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case no pen@@ al indicator was placed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Elec@@ toral Court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy to corrupt and illegal practices due to a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games will be amazed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ decker of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympics is by far not the only ath@@ lete competing for gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood @-@ famous celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US squ@@ ad Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood .
apart from K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the wheel track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US squ@@ ad Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star incredibly similar .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t see a big simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I &apos;ll take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big expressive eyes will be able to go through Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an as a double @-@ decker for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the pool , Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user is convinced that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just sun tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities .
theory placed in space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese flo@@ ater called &quot; how to low &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was off when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming relay .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more colour , could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as M@@ ief , he died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese flo@@ ater Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second leg of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadian to close the gap to China .
audiences across Canada re@@ acted quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many talked to him
Twitter users did not go back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
shortly after Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the commentary of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate choice , we &apos;re sorry it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with the people who responded to the Noti@@ ce on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ined about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed and released a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday we quickly ap@@ olog@@ ised to our viewers on the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on it as a person .
yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy formulation . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was conceived as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment that I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shop@@ per in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly tries to under@@ wear in the middle of the business
the buyers did not know where to go when a woman took her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked out as she looked in it , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark business at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the hypo@@ theses before putting her back on the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other hypo@@ theses , before she finally decided that she liked nothing , with@@ drew and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who would under certain circumstances buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; woman Davi@@ dson , 33 living in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting that someone would take under@@ pants home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the staff tried to pull out the pieces of clothing after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had attacked her and pulled out and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Pri@@ mark spokes@@ man said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were pulled out of the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer around for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
when you approach you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and move out of the shot line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
strike him with his knee in the l@@ ath and twist , while the attack@@ er cur@@ bs against pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on it .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight on the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and direct the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Miz@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est way to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ uts his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a guide
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ du@@ ed his immune system and wor@@ sen@@ ing of a serious test by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k completed his course on a Euro ticket , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush @-@ button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before finishing each object , he used a lumin@@ osity to show himself and us what he is going to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of dra@@ gging the flush button of a tension toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely dis@@ pul@@ sive , but actually there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his trip through Europe Mr. W@@ right talked with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by travelling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public g@@ uts to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task put his immune system defini@@ tively under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he met his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test score showed a lumin@@ ous number of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a r@@ ussi@@ an toilet , which he refused to lick off after their lumin@@ ous number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst I &apos;ve cleaned in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dis@@ cour@@ aged than that !
I will do nothing here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company is equi@@ pping Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick it like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social Family Dest@@ ro@@ yed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung &apos;s social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a delay with a loss of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ by and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
when they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had pla@@ sty holes , wooden boards were torn , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the property management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing said that she fears that the apartment is no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not so beautiful as a part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug traffi@@ cking , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive cries , disputes and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ eton , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , wooden boards were torn down
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to call the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing gave her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the estate , after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung was che@@ ered by the ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years alongside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we &apos;re not used to it !
now that they are finally away , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it had planned the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown site of the community house
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , since a dele@@ tion is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into account .
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung on the ground .
workers of the property management will have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ eton received a fine , after having found guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial view .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ by , who died in 2013 at a car accident .
after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she will navigate rent@@ ers who do not cling to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told us that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not cling to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without blame , and to those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal transferred to panic after an eff@@ ig@@ ent military jet flies to the beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air forces placed an incredible storm flight
the air forces assumed that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no safety risk was present
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ lu@@ ent jet crashed over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the beach section in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the keys without first seeing what came upon them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew really very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to the bad visibility due to the poor visibility conditions , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people died to death on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke smoke , which restric@@ ts his view .
the aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step towards first title win in the new soccer season .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup to the FC Sevilla , the re@@ play climbs three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ sp@@ inner has to for@@ ego N@@ ey@@ mar with the defeated cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning Europe League champion , competing in the Olympic soccer tournament with Brazil .
also , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training session , which allowed Bar@@ ca to settle for at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique , so far , ren@@ ounced a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen is the leader in most other applications .
before the first match of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test run by Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince .
Sev@@ ille once again wins the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and asp@@ ires to win the second triumph at the &quot; Super cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far eleven successes in this race , Barcelona is the record winner .
Ma Long in a separate league table to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and defending champion Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) .
the World Ranking First won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at WM , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese J@@ un Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed to make it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them .
they pulled back on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the match up here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fin@@ als I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said fol@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected stirring match did not develop .
however , there were nevertheless sufficient breathtaking b@@ ale changes to be seen .
Mi@@ zut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ White was bred to a ri@@ pp@@ le injury and was then in medical treatment , but had to settle &quot; with sheet metal . &quot;
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) , by the way , had been Olympic @-@ fourth in similarly high table tennis .
Donald Tr@@ ump sums up huge problems in the election campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is afflicted by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative federal states to lose their majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now identified weaknesses in his campaign in the former repub@@ li@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary usually appears in a large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident manner , as correspon@@ dents stated .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own repub@@ li@@ can camp , there is now doubt about his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for assistance in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt is false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
repub@@ li@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds wi@@ ggle
U@@ tah is normally a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ US in June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were equal to the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see tr@@ ump at the front , but not by the distance common to Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by the transmitter CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump replied to the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will either be successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not end for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , said Tr@@ ump on .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tr@@ ump is said to have threatened to cancel funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present better results .
instead , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be more powerful than their arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Olympia : three @-@ star fraud test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second D@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
after a fraud test in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee informed us immediately to establish a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary announced that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village had submitted a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported by the leadership of Kenya by the D@@ oping Contro@@ ll@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF world association has examined the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to do its own investigations , divided an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , handed out and signed the sample , &quot; explained Mr Ken@@ yan &apos;s head de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of athletes standing on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan head of athle@@ tics , Michael Rot@@ ich , had been withdrawn from the Rio Olympics .
he is alleged to have informed athletes of his country about pending d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was allegedly arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , after numerous D@@ oping routes , Kenya has been under special observation for some time now .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Olympics , it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic start .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a tall runner nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were raised again and again that dop@@ ing resources are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport bet@@ ru@@ gs .
the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently challenged a similar study in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
thereby it was possible to prove that this type of sport has been systematically and systematically dop@@ ed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers of love , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director of Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled herself with the role of Mary a youth mare .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly at her favorite with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because it &apos;s unusual musi@@ cally !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
she is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with it .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have the refugees , at that time , the p@@ anc@@ akes went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the same themes , and they are as significant today as they were then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , died according to reports in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war@@ med land and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London went on a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .

Rei@@ d says that in the case of election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , the leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the de@@ ceased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the highest judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands Nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and Hel@@ per Hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring a 1970 @-@ year Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys distinguishes itself , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that the calendar also does .
&quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classic nu@@ dity in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally during open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kur@@ ds congregation of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of prot@@ esters fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term there could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chairman of the association , Ali Top@@ ra@@ k , believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh action of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of prot@@ esters from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already out@@ stri@@ pped Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the tur@@ mo@@ il put@@ sch still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that welcomes refugees in their own country produces refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the Association lam@@ ented the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
with this , Erdo@@ gan wanted to increase the ex@@ iting pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or displaced over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Prime Minister demanded that the federal government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is held against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel no longer safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ular@@ ist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to the numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already set up the largest group of asylum eligible for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , this amounted to 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognised as eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
this elevation does not include those found in war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state &apos;s side , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia should not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because stupid than so far it &apos;s not about : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bites .
the locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the election milit@@ ants , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers that are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so are not allowed to choose the country day .
there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and counting votes at the end are only troubles@@ ome .
until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and final day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave once again election campaign close to the people passing by .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of a coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ters a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering gets cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ sten@@ ed the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is to make electoral campaign at the right place at the wrong time .
she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to open @-@ up meetings twice ; Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kreis is located in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely eliminates the usual poll@@ ing conditions on market@@ places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , meaning co@@ king , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union has also noticed that in the country you are crum@@ bling the base , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again .
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the expan@@ se of the country .
the advice of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert to his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD for a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the S &amp; D Group recently dropped 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the 2011 election the SPD had still clearly gained 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of a holiday and reloc@@ ate their election campaign largely to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the head of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green election fighters embar@@ k on a search for local vocal ch@@ ests among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ ts with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
there are praise for those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.@@ 30@@ am and only ends at 20 o &apos;clock in the morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site could be moved to the south according to schedule at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praise will also be commen@@ ded by those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up residence trips . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site moved south to the south and the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been resum@@ ed , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed .
the citizens can now travel from O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive movement through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Deputy Princip@@ al Director Florian King , responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ le@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sne@@ akers were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the sign@@ age .
what led to some trucks in residential areas fran@@ c@@ ised .
since the speed limits were not met , the municipality also called for M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant exc@@ esses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself a spot on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been carved .
the fastest was on the way at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ Zone .
since the construction site has moved further , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg now the road is open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales break@@ through@@ s makes everyone who is asked to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the renovation has little consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running documentary is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily traffi@@ cked are the locals along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crowned crown , finds distinct words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we need to be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue is reduced to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; street renov@@ ations have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dis@@ miss half of his co @-@ workers .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where this has been handled more gener@@ ously .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are now less frequent due to the complicated traffic guidance .
if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also nice somewhere else .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his family clientele is returning to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction to its clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is constantly being bol@@ ted to laws in the name of the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a large security package .
but what has to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the verse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not exc@@ la@@ im anybody .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as the interior minister , he was close to results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère presented a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU rules on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals that were not to be made with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and dum@@ b jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he considers this reasonable and also does not demand anything that has no chances at the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
some of them have it in mind : it plans fast processes for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees that are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check .
in case of in@@ ventions for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as comm@@ itting crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers in order to mask their identity .
some of these are politically and legally sensitive .
some of the things also seem to be sp@@ un off and leave questions open .
and with some points - in the im@@ treatment of tolerated ones for example - the question arises : what actually does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to deny that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people worried about security .
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly employed people could not be cl@@ utter@@ ed at times even in election campaign times .
the focus is on inner security .
first , the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the topic of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few days , the two parties went up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a gar@@ sti@@ cal dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security @-@ political ideas collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the departments also call for a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also works here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a return from the double pass .
we have negotiated the discussion in Germany .
it is not useful to re@@ plen@@ ish you .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist , has to be revealed .
there &apos;s a lot in it , which could cause a fight .
but the SPD is currently attempting to gain a footh@@ old in the topic of inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first shows caution and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nor does Volkswagen come up with a g@@ lim@@ p .
despite the sale of diesel , deliveries of extra@@ dition are increasing worldwide .
but it is not all around the markets .
in the recall action there is vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen starts to start deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite the many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , VW &apos;s core brand was weaker , especially in Western Europe , and again imp@@ acted the total sales of the company , as listed in the Da@@ x company .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
in Western Europe alone , after China , the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
deliveries in the home market of Germany declined by almost one sixth .
head of marketing Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has given a reluct@@ ance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation surrounding the coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU was also bur@@ dened by a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the Ex@@ hau@@ st Fig@@ ures first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the princip@@ ally affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is still further ag@@ grav@@ ated by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , there is only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
from January to July , Group sales leader Fred Kap@@ pler continued to present a sales platform .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ating gas tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after converting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output .
after the change@@ over , the coach has a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as stated on Friday in corporate travel .
legal refin@@ ement is the reason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen now provides its German customers with a guarantee for converted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport confirms that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my Commission of In@@ quiry and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has taken over the guarantee that no deterioration will take place in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after retro@@ fitting and all relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not how it was called in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , customers come to a workshop for half a year after the change@@ over - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage does not have anything to do with it .
even in the interests of the customer , it is important to avoid that in any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust sc@@ andal , there will be uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations as it was said .
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ al interest from rich savers - a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Josef Paul said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposits or daily cash accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it : normal savers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not have to fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee applies to Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients for deposits exceeding EUR 100,000 on sight deposits or daily cash accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time now , he ski@@ pped 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lie down for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , the cost is now further reduced .
leaving the cash in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four incidents , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank executive .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavarian co @-@ operative federation declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry them alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically un@@ feasible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their bank account fees , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 with p@@ enti@@ t@@ ines for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong for banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is more sum@@ p@@ tuous of the fortune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she jumps money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; no further banks are currently known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which charge a reimbur@@ sement for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and the immigration of investors threat@@ ens to compete .

destination Pl@@ ates : who actually buy records ?
lonely middle @-@ aged men love plates .
before you rush to the comment section , to over@@ see it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non@@ Alle@@ Ein@@ sam@@ en@@ mascul@@ ine @-@ age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millenni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a plate are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v right ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I &apos;m in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest grey suit and stu@@ ffed wild before I stop , hold my hands and say something about something like this : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , whom I from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dressed the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and again buying items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media channel , people who have heard about com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I led , people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs now to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of followers of the record revision of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to see that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves , from objects that awaken happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to focus mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fle@@ es from a plate stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have record players .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while I plan@@ ed through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came just recently here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own record players , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them on a shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product las@@ si@@ ly , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have record players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , who has dedicated the sound records almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ ar@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ ming from the speakers - is it good to see such a diversity among the customers .
none of them looks strange but cal@@ ming psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale .
she rather makes a window @-@ shopping than a big shopping .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it casts off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while I &apos;m sorry to wear jeans @-@ hot pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crossover record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as boards .
even if my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , they don &apos;t take into account the large number of female collectors in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday mor@@ nings with security not with the crum@@ bling through plate shops of Ber@@ wick Street and sheets through plates while avoiding the star@@ ing look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake moder@@ ator who raises nothing of middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French Court re@@ jects the offer of demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would cause a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups shared the Court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also concluded that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide shelter and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provisional transactions , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than feeding people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the tear@@ drop was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is generally operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jung@@ les had risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains fighting
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance in the Olympic period , Rad@@ os Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to be interrupted .
&quot; I keep watching the World Cup , stay confident and fight on , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly say it is difficult to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse in silence what reasons had led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin really wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s ras@@ cals must adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the tem@@ pos@@ als should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary speed limit , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary flash heater to comply with speed limits .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days for continuous measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be detected simultaneously across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as access restrictions according to time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
according to the manufacturer , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
so that it is not simply cl@@ utter@@ ed , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear from the outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash@@ ed with the new technology : recently , France ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
UK re@@ covers silver in 7 @-@ er rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold takes up
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit by a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ odor@@ o stadium here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ up , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad dri@@ p prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but independently of it Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in the form of this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under R@@ yan , they lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began to mar@@ vel at the attacks G@@ Bs had fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell an and Co. as if one would run into travelling buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au compla@@ ined in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
Mit@@ ch@@ ell &apos;s prot@@ ru@@ ding tackle stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , Y@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a left a touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re @-@ whi@@ stle and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u comp@@ eted by further weak Tac@@ tics of the GB team and stor@@ med down to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still continues to learn .
this is how it is .
GB resulted in basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through after a brilliant stop@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags wave and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ ff sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked in the grass .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain th@@ ron@@ ged South Africa in a tight semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer to win rowing
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than in these games and that will mean something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 tough p@@ ieve , which enter the story , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the response of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they called for the second Olympic champion in a row without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports , who laid such a standard .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ lubri@@ cated effort , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets that gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not mirror the way of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing lies a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know if he was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did that .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if this is the right concept at all .
I needed money , so I had to get better again .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it starts .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even greater .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ing morning trying something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a Captain at the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much this means , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person to train or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with it .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very captiv@@ ated at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; lead in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not anxious to make something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race whatever we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , will reti@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water purpose association as a model for large water producers .
some time ago , it was called in the original sound in a contribution by the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia dig@@ ged the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of staff for 31 years , stands for 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes around 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a wat@@ wart company in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Board of Management in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the renovation of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the re@@ development of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ development of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and you have always been innov@@ ating because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ er &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service for more than 31 years .
he has used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best wat@@ wart and he was a faithful cap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view he called the well construction and the re@@ organisation of the purpose association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the tu@@ b@@ ular break@@ age at church lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can also maintain the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n only because the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt filled with hoses .

&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a .
when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die .
however , the eight year old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now I &apos;m studying in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something that is two years back when I sang at La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationships at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man is shooting for life partner
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and wounded them severely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called himself and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , and after him , he was publicly prosec@@ uted .
meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ baked and has a bald .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile , the man is wearing a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he can still carry the weapon with him , like the police .
those who see Sven S. will call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship @-@ at &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck initially wanted to make no statements about the departure or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but it confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a criminal off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special service command@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens threatening the industry out of green electricity are from the table .
it remains at the liberation from the Renewable Energy Con@@ dition in the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Com@@ miss@@ ar Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent falls .
but even this is not being raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for power generation .
thus the status quo of the previous arrangement is largely determined .
Gabriel has special significance for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be considered in the reform of emissions legislation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation escal@@ ated further , when China &apos;s world &apos;s largest producer of producers threw steel into the world market in light of the weaker domestic demand .
European manufacturers t@@ oss price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has relaxed a little .
on the one hand , the import duties imposed on imported steel show effect , and on the other hand , economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened .
it is unclear how sustain@@ ably the price pick @-@ up is .
German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
finally the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
finally Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced more than six percent less crude steel at 3.@@ 4 million tonnes than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Industry Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
thanks to an improved order situation , the association anticip@@ ates rising emissions in the coming months .
community , mind , health : singing does sen@@ iors well
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject of music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old is singing in an elderly choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several points of view , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking and organizing herself , being able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast as they can in everyday life .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in elderly people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &apos; Association .
in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher value , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses a lot of memories , often associated with positive emotions of their youth .
by song lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ den@@ yed people de@@ compose on long @-@ lying events .
in singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
to concentrate simultaneously on one &apos;s voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone do not only concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you experience through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise something for a long time , I will be better and awake beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes beside it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a retirement choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with Internet research .
whoever wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good to the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a han@@ go@@ ver on the cries of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the Ru@@ fen of k@@ itt@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys has on adult animals .
to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression degree of k@@ itt@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens , who think themselves in great distress , such as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance for the males , &quot; said bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ scre@@ ams differ with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight que@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were pre @-@ played to a call of little ones who were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens that were raised additionally .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker when this calls were played by the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises .
some studies showed that women responded more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski reaches Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
a arrest warrant has been issued against the former So@@ ccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match is taking place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the arch riv@@ als between the Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even in the case of sus@@ pending the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government , the daily routine of regular citizens , should not be affected .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
even before football it is not stopped .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
according to this , the South East living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
he is said to be a follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact the life of most Turks , however , has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan to be finished on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what the majority of the Turks unites in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially arriving at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions the 31 year old finished his first playing time as the top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejo@@ iced : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the preliminary kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also say good @-@ bye in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the south of Li@@ g , it only reached sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to gain something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year of the game was better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th Tit@@ le with 26 season numbers as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ rit@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
at the same time , the Gom@@ ez , which was signed at the AC Florence and sold to Bes@@ ik@@ tas , had announced after the coup attempt , not to return to the country after his European holiday because of the political situation in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club head Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the storm would have to be ready to for@@ ego about a third of its annual salary estimated to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man pointed out : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was blocked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova must not start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can laugh at it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had compla@@ ined her start right shortly before the games after a D@@ oping @-@ lock , was pi@@ ped off and extended mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters chest ) .
there was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a super@@ sti@@ tious smile she was still standing in the hall and provoked her performance .
when it became clear that she wasn &apos;t going to get gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ee .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the D@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics .
here an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its inc@@ eption , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to wait a six month lock in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had severe tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion was tested for the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied entry and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gol@@ fers .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and locked 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , fu@@ elled mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete has been able to disc@@ ern so many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title because of testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also rec@@ alled due to a verdict of the International Sport Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the World Champion and Gold@@ favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positively only in May , but may still compete in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion found indications of taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the block@@ age of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA dropped mil@@ dly and was already running on July 13 .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I was able to leave it again .
her home@@ ward journey was planned for the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the island island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as waste .
at about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two bla@@ sting sentences went up again , and another man was killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured at the det@@ onation near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban worker .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives set in the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ eastern coast called for several injuries .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express itself on possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities in recent days should have kept secret references to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is sitting behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they don &apos;t turn against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the present bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and Sur@@ ro@@ undings .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , it is not necessary to leave the necessary journeys into these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta CEO and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to insti@@ gate chaos while the country moves towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , continues to benefit from having the kingdom restored to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t stop in the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several national offices , the Constitutional Prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation also put the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indications for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ using in extrem@@ ist fashion .
that is why we are watching the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group of French roots active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional guards in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - are already observing the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that his authority was closely aligned with the local authorities in deciding on the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; identical movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not bet@@ ting advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to this .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians had been reported from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that he had no knowledge about that .
for the protection of the constitution , potential contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case - is the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the substantial increase in right @-@ wing criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism in this connection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we have found in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler group .
it may well be that other righ@@ tist groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal terrorism is not recognis@@ able .
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
they expressed concern that many attacks on the account of people did not appear in the right scene before .

Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games and World Records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia sw@@ am so slowly that at times he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 year old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 year old particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more popular in under@@ represented countries .
as most sports@@ men walk in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
some media referred to him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ hale . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle .
m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump sees the threatening electoral defeat not so tight
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there &apos;s nothing to choose from the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has an alternative video .
he then asc@@ ends to the holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not end for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , said Tr@@ ump .
he thus described the US President Barack Obama and the democr@@ ats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance formed .
post rises to trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter also .
the Group will soon start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the mail wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters from the coming year also on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go on sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been evaluating for months whether they will sell their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to other companies .
post @-@ Managing Director Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there is always questioning , for example by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group plans to embar@@ k on mass production of vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ production plant , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles over the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
FR@@ P leadership replaces dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Consumer Research Company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the returns came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K made it clear that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more un@@ reliable the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the world &apos;s number five stands in front of a personnel new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already dischar@@ ges from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board of the Executive Board assumed the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger on 1 September and shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is to officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy as a reason for the returns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
it is still unclear who will be conducting the market research company in future .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ kreis it was said on Friday that the shareholders were finally disappointed with the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ peak since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recent poor Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it were the case with BMW , that would also do the odds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the Company did not have to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable previous year &apos;s quarter .
in the first half of the year , sales contracted by 3.4 percent to EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million .
in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was above all imp@@ acted by the decline in the value of the company .
the company &apos;s value depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business sector , under@@ lined the loss of EUR 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had generated a net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight wounded
in an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , shared the police with them .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her testimony , had to devi@@ ate from the truck , which partly ro@@ de on the opposite course .
the bus stopped right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as reported by a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and one emergency ambul@@ ance came to the scene of the accident on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ last travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste water will take place from 1 October 2016 for the area of sewage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , Kul@@ mb@@ ach found that shel@@ ters are running for these sewage systems .
due to legal bases , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se .
the revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , also over@@ - and under@@ cover covers from the previous calculation period are to be compensated .
Schmidt explained that the serious charges increase in all three waste water installations by relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , in the previous calculation period , renovation and repair expenses were considerably reduced in all three plants due to their age .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the D@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Az@@ endorf wastewater treatment plant .
in the Wel@@ sh@@ ahl pumping station , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led , and after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still clearly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water installation in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance &quot; are fully operational . &quot;
in addition , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed .
according to stone houses , the situation for the aforementioned systems will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long term , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wastewater @-@ purpose unit could not be extended because it is a lack of defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remained unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are non @-@ blo@@ omed , property @-@ based tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all abor@@ tions are transferred to the public .
in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have provoked criticism in which they were accused of using the App Black@@ face promotional or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week struck some users a filter that gave them sl@@ otted eyes , false teeth and dark che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended to be a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hur@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was said to be unpleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very contradictory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yel@@ low@@ ish face has been pulled into the degra@@ ding extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats &apos;s great audience of young people - who in terms of race are more different than their older opponents - might be more likely to anticipate sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters an image that is offensive to a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to stay un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same thing .
in an essay on media and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the attitudes practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ ameri@@ can Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors working there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a HR officer focusing on sub@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , on the other hand , said that she will close her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fy IS@@ IS intelligence , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command modified intelligence to draw up a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when it allowed the actual states on site to report in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a task force of the Republi@@ can members of the Committee Committ@@ ees , Intelligence Committ@@ ees , and the Military Commission Com@@ mit@@ ment , reports a great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their estim@@ ations on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence intelligence , typically dismissed by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com comm@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a positive picture of US efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government officials under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com was publicly known to announce that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command leaders changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Department of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the Republi@@ can Task Force conclusions .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest @-@ ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the Represent@@ ative House Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave exc@@ essively little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that he had no clu@@ es on the intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation of the Pentagon &apos;s In@@ spec@@ tor , which was received after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports of the Congress while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations also have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of intermedi@@ aries of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stipul@@ ated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State should have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his exc@@ essively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain is standing
one day after they scored three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember to have done that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory .
however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch something longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
as always the game will go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ around in London that we now have .
we have been able to carry out the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a reco@@ il from the close range .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and le@@ aked the ball into the gate to give the American women a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. door@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in any of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amidst the ro@@ age of the Olympic Games , the trampoline &apos;s Zen
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and in@@ es@@ capable , a fur@@ ious relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is handed down from the cross@@ bow to the tri@@ ath@@ lete to the tri@@ ath@@ lete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a flock of women with dimples , might have been among those well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV ads , if it were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : aerial pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it reign for a long time .
but if I have a modest argument for my particular favourite , let me draw your attention to the dis@@ crete char@@ ms of the trampoline .
although jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it has been so spar@@ sely noticed for the last 16 years that many of them , I had asked , did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an ath@@ lete until 2012 who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian people for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has some kind of out@@ sider char@@ ms , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ful trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending jumping - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means much like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bud@@ ding vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
according to the official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to type , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for gold continue to go up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground .
they don &apos;t just ch@@ ase the finish line or the starting wall , but also a further increase in TV transmission : the world or the Olympia @-@ ords .
the pur@@ pos@@ eful aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed even while watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then downward , then effort@@ lessly back up .
here too , there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , too at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days starting at 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - as the male US tur@@ ner recently proposed , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan community to come to the air .
&quot; one generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in the case of shot changes .
is Ethiopia pulling together right now ?
in the last ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rush@@ ed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was rel@@ ent@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed prot@@ esters .
in circulation videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror attacks beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to lead the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , with dissi@@ dents effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or to prison , killed or driven into the sides of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time , the tensions along the Er@@ it@@ rea border rise ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des , which have been enforced more or less in recent years , will exploit the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness are explo@@ ding under the surface after years of climax .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , above all in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they reside .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who are predominantly Christian high@@ lands from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but this too is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is illeg@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 , was 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands prot@@ ested against elections which , according to the analysts , apparently ple@@ dged from the government and were subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of tur@@ mo@@ il passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously , this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal en@@ vy of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an official city , run by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group , not seriously .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position to declare statements that he could not have meant .
after making the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump with@@ drew in regards to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative radio ob@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by rec@@ alling that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to focus his campaign on falling survey values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he attracted strong criticism when he thought the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later declared &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then move back as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even better tone as his survey values have gone further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a big advantage in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally attempting to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal fellow comb@@ at@@ ants into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ ack@@ ers , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he pulled out the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by being aggres@@ sively under control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of dealing with each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once scattered over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
ver@@ b Cafe was a cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg where you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were pushed out of Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business , replaced in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people used it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , it &apos;s also re @-@ invention .
a revi@@ ved ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he began to work in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a client offered to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese on the menu and there are gar@@ ni@@ ings like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café does not serve any beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , previously lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club on a regular basis .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the club closed , she gave up the coffee drink for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I knew it was about coffee and culture in the verb I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still has his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment on the fact that soap business has taken hold of the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for bre@@ wing with the coffee of coffee in the café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he plans to leave them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice store wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed cup of coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighbouring building .
a new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
for gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies from Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both grocery historians .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear in Har@@ per &apos;s publishing house on Tuesday , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sle@@ ek snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Ziegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable blend ate .
when the repor@@ ter ordered h@@ ack@@ ery , this found the couple fitting for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ buffet in an American household , especially in rural areas .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways in which the country avoided being no longer the Cock@@ aig@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious meals such as bre@@ ads and d@@ asser@@ bies became a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ covering food residues , &quot; noted Ziegel@@ man , as chefs could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare ser@@ ed luxury .
unique bl@@ ends have been tried out as a cal@@ orie rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has prim@@ acy over taste or even healthy common sense .
while resear@@ ching the book that includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or ever since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - said the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and to meet the challenge of turning p@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially tasty are the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ food @-@ pose .
while he openly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he feeds like the million @-@ dollar man from the world to which he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked Continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was terri@@ bly realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to stamp an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the occup@@ ying of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country reg@@ ained its legs .
the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple explained the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better when writing the book - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; she really made people sick . &quot;
there was the incident in the wind .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the Pf@@ lau@@ men@@ desserts , which ate President Roos@@ ev@@ elt at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick to miss a modest name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each di@@ pped something reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E scores three times a stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died even with a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group which , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved some 60@@ ,000 lives .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives in the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil defence , showing him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol of symbol@@ ism in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said al@@ oud : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save life , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the recent bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the AD area , which was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; we now eliminate the toxic rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that children do not play with it , &quot; the picture rec@@ ites his last words before he died .
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea aboard the S@@ anna research ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats at about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks only get offspring with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at a rich 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
but this lifestyle shaped lifestyle seems to be a recipe for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was true that the evolution@@ ist had long suspected that Greenland sh@@ arks will become stone old .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland ha@@ i@@ ries are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks .
their slow @-@ up tempo measured them , when they out@@ fitted six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitz@@ bergen .
the loo@@ t nevertheless makes this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and seek cad@@ a@@ vers , which are tor@@ ting from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest of 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers was measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore likely to lie in the early 1960s , when atomic weapons search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third @-@ smallest animal of 220 centimet@@ ers , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ i@@ ries , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers may be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks with the increase obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is not by chance that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on peak , was captured in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal influences heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than in one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Sch@@ euer@@ lein the Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources rather in a long life .
building plot in double pack
with issues surrounding building , the Municipal Council has focuss@@ ed on the most recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently reported housing areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the land , par@@ cel@@ er@@ ation and development issues were cleared and the applications for sur@@ ve@@ ying could be placed , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Straß@@ wal@@ weg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) of interested parties is nothing more in the way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au will appeal to young families and other elderly alike .
as it was said , building volunteers can now report in the Town Hall , and the Municipal Council is expected to advise the Municipal Council in its September session .
in order to also request en@@ quiries about the establishment of other industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ areas .
in the Lower Tim@@ lar@@ n area , the area already designated there is extended by two plots in the direction of the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main therefore has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether financial stores continue to operate from London through financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , admission to the UK is still sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is just taking advantage of large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , according to the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which is responsible for monetary policy and supervision of the biggest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk group ES@@ R@@ B .
although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters in Paris , it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , it also deterior@@ ates badly with the infrastructure as it does in Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the Seine was a 50 percent higher rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the Company Consulting Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers .
in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US official judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to a refund of the legal costs resulting from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were associated with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts .
at the request of the complaint on Thursday , US official Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to leave the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to match Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to the year 2013 when Gal@@ a@@ ad and Mer@@ ck claimed each other and claimed property on laboratory work , which provided sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( TP@@ MS ) , following the withdrawal of the still remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently the city .
they have liber@@ ated over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the comb@@ at@@ ants , shared with the D@@ KS of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters , al@@ lied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are carrying out cleaning operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced their tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in USD 10.@@ 75 million for the presidential candidate and her husband , and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aren .
Clin@@ t &apos;s candidate for Vice Pres@@ i@@ dency , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards with regard to financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false pron@@ oun@@ cements and re@@ pul@@ sions in relation to his previous promises to publish his declarations of taxation .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax audi@@ ts are not finished .
among other things , Tr@@ ump critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already heard that his refusal raises questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and posted a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asks to release his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke on the topic also during a speech on economics in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the last decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a series of tax attor@@ neys and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away developed industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here , called Tr@@ ump to a meeting to share their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had just been subjected to a tax audit of I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ ton &apos;s campaign has been releasing tax returns back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that only USD 100 of their income earned their wages , unlike most Americans .
its main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ powder , fire@@ work bodies promote dance ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , has intensified its promotion along with U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without viol@@ ating animals .
before , many carriers used to defend themselves .
Friday is the Day Day devoted to animal welfare .
&quot; since we developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ch@@ ili@@ powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ powder into the air .
a breath usually starts to ch@@ ase the elephant .
a last chance represents a laun@@ cher who shoots a gold @-@ dre@@ amy fire@@ works in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
city council votes unanim@@ ously : no neo @-@ construction at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

the City Council now unanim@@ ously rejected the request for the construction of a sales ski@@ room on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine bal@@ kon@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but at this location in an exposed location on the bank of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arabic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invitation - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media uprising after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election as it had requested Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and extingu@@ ished ?
Lanz@@ mann wrote .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be cleared , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called it a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and were dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a bigger dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the Internet , where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands of Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in another article , pointing out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the South German newspaper a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added .
police Re@@ places tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police deployed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the introduction of rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the federal state of Sao Paulo Ger@@ ald Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the protest participants were able to spray gra@@ ff@@ iti on walls against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er .
the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators in the crowd went on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the previous year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country grew strongly , the ambassador informed them .
Russian companies are adop@@ ting existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further commercial exploitation is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representation represented approximately 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , first of all travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year were broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses sought : beverage market inf@@ ested in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening has been practiced on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the issuing of cash and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver VW Golf .
how much money was captured , the police did not share with them .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly visible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the assault , the perpetr@@ ators must be moved to Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from the gravel parking space located opposite the parking @-@ house entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Sle@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) are urgently required to report to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and Fun at Summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the Children &apos;s Protection Society Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer holidays in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the quiet recreational village of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle during the first week of school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to B@@ rescue with the visit of the stro@@ z@@ oos .
on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s tour in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group was delighted at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and p@@ add@@ ling .
culinary delights were given to children and car@@ egi@@ vers with their own prepared food , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops , it was used to create beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of home@@ ward journey , the sun and the children and you@@ ths returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the mini @-@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ ting @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the time to the next 60 @-@ year pilgrimage of all the mini@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the St. Anna &apos;s head of ministers has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally chosen for the Freiburg bishop &apos;s city , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the opening of the mercy of the Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gre@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ stad set their way .
in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and informed the pilgrims .
from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Min@@ ster of Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage from Münster was started .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening with a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way the Min@@ is made ra@@ ges at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song of specially compiled pilgri@@ m song .
parish homes of local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and stren@@ uous dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we passed through Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ st@@ bach .
on top of that , we took the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting distance , but at first we had to drop some 500 meters in the heat and then get out of it again .
the deserved reward was in the evening a joint barbecue at the swimming pool .
after the morning pulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
the Min@@ is were visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy in the late afternoon at Freiburg cathedral and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a small impulse God was given thanks .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t was welcomed at the evening Mass in Münster .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the city of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rush@@ es home as Br@@ ite Gold wins for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anchor roll , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the legend proudly made the legend when he stor@@ med home to get a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick , after they took a modest sixth place in London , despite the Ho@@ ys &apos; res@@ ignation in March .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in due time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Gary &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner won an olymp@@ ic record in the qualification rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des fell short after his turn , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner was holding it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we have set up an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally falling on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like London with all the UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we went so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which was won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ o@@ rom .
with the shape Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23rd ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a hi@@ ve of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same as that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record that won gold in London 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he fought with representatives before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there was drama in the background , the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ bing repro@@ aches , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , that has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ish all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy specified for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct and indirect - could be at risk with closure .
in addition , it could come to Dom@@ ino@@ effects , as the sm@@ el@@ ting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the Al@@ coa sm@@ el@@ ting process in Port@@ land lo@@ oses money and risks closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L anticip@@ ates that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L further stated that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice of termination , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all potential impact on earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L stated that the value of the contracts had already been depreci@@ ated in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expectation of cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or guarantee the power supply to the sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not compromise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have come into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation why it has withdrawn from the contract .
analy@@ st warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consume around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s not good for us as a generator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , ges@@ kri@@ pt reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n problem cases and in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this is the c@@ lich@@ é story of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow .
with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , certainly a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an began .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim might have beaten her about the Vo@@ gue cover ( they and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles an image book rather than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the ram@@ ble 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still le@@ aked before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there have been clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that mo@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and distributor J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success for everyone .
with their reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers has always been a bit ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ oe of the moment . &quot;
these feelings boiled again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but running around on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made images of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the W@@ TV magazine .
and in her free time she is watching Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal authority centers annually assign 160@@ ,000 people
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s assistance centers are rejected annually by the municipal authorities , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ loaded , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centers will lose 30 percent of their federal funding .
the Director of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s Joint Par@@ liam@@ entary Centers said that the latest survey of the National Federation of Commun@@ ism Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without the decision of the German government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s Commun@@ es Centr@@ es are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debt , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just@@ ly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
the federal government will cut the resources by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we urge the At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of communities and their customers , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Ele@@ ction Camp@@ aig@@ n accused after Emplo@@ ye@@ es allegedly moved
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump Camp@@ aig@@ n has been accused of alleged in@@ action after you have been told that in February her campaign leader for North Carolina sent a gun to a staff while they were in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Regional Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i stated that months have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , laid his right index finger on the trigger , and rush@@ ed over the barrel at Vinc@@ enzo Kne@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining to local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ord@@ i noted that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indi@@ ct@@ ment only comes two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dis@@ b@@ anded a rebellion when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment people should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and appoint judges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign clearly indicated that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ ordin@@ is appeals to damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and of Philip for bodily injury and abi@@ ding psychological damage .
b@@ ump Press spokes@@ man Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l ahead of country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses are recorded for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could scar@@ cely rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD over@@ threw from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent 5 years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iled ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( 18.@@ 4 percent earlier ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite the slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Green Party returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent each .
according to the survey , the SPD of the poll@@ s would only come to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they were still lag@@ ging behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return that the pirates would miss in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia Communic@@ ator was on the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the unit weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes at the beginning , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in West@@ pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , also by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser , albeit dor@@ man@@ t slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the Smartphone era .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile saver experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , suppliers dominate the market , all of which came much later than Nokia .
being online anytime and anywhere , that &apos;s everyday for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion units were sold , Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has now been developed around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was just beginning in 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all with touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march started , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , watched the show .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the smartphone aside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local and local companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities we will already have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ rows is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympics , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn in weather growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both in the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented run@@ ways .
now they are ready to deliver a third walk@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to turn this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ ole@@ um &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , the software manufacturer tries to avoid ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop page would change coding on its ads to make it more difficult to detect sign@@ aling on the part of the site advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her fight between the insti@@ g@@ ating open source community and the det@@ ours has already been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has left the fight is a strong indication of how alar@@ ming indicators of display have become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ f@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people use display lock@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook &apos;s advertising revenues .
the company has reported it to ad blocking on Desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient share of revenues so that Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block &apos;s new filters were wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have focused instead on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into people &apos;s hands .
commit suicide on Swiss motorway in case of presum@@ ed suicide
the victim was in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday in a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was over@@ riding by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , who , as well as any witnesses of the incident , asked to report .
an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which was a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running along the motorway in the middle of the night as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a police officer was acqu@@ itted after having crossed a man who had killed a man who was lying near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , arrested the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman had responded to an emergency call -- and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; totally extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have er@@ ect similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exhibits its daylight side of the sun for nearly two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously thought by planetary explor@@ ers .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
her oceans evapor@@ ated and her water vap@@ or was burnt away from the ultra@@ violet light .
as her hydro @-@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the A@@ val@@ an@@ che as trainer
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ned on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternative President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association is immediately looking for a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the summer , I &apos;ve been thinking about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the coach &apos;s vision and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations have to be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Z@@ acc@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ acc@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has been recognized as the best trainer in the league with the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club on 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ o@@ workers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labor disputes relating to the remuneration for North Sea workers are suspended , while all the conflic@@ ting parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been spor@@ adi@@ cally performed on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions in the next weeks that will start next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has reduced rates to its counter@@ parties in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s recommendation is followed by a 10 % decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the needed space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and plans to abandon its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega association with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish parliamentary committee Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the largest work disputes that took place in the North Sea ever since .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen at different rates as well as in what context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with the formation of planets .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other con@@ stell@@ ations , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rotation rates , these stra@@ pping stars rep@@ el large amounts of star @-@ winds .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
pull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the P@@ lei@@ ades &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ballet we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rotation rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the Tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has given him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 until 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values .
however , the 41 year old should not be included in the fame hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside of the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; banned ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the prime suspect to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for years .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could have done me a favour for 2014 , because I had played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends once again get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win every game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , gave sympathy to fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
a well @-@ informed ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
the first official dop@@ ing incidents in Rio de Janeiro have become known before the seventh day of competition .
the Chinese flo@@ aters Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil and excluded - just before the start of critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was demonstrated last Sunday that is used as a mas@@ king drug for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterfly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en should have participated in the runs of more than 50 m of fre@@ estyle .
at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing has been requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and requires Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news released about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to be the banned substance of the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported his criticism of the Bul@@ letin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t take the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ed nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier than his brother Tom@@ as@@ z .
both deny taking , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had not banned the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , in swimming @-@ sport , the earlier off@@ ences in China also ensured fierce disputes between the athletes .
thus the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 metres of fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focus of a confrontation with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ ds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , Sun had been positively tested by the Chinese Championships on the stimul@@ ant of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine but had to wait for a three @-@ month lock .
dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize in attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to black@@ out ran@@ som is significantly higher than for private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertisements .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in recent months terri@@ bly fast .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches specifically for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delete the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the final breakdown code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is at stake for private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ dingly higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware is hit .
22 percent of the German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to inter@@ rupt their business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , it only supports the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of a stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers , in turn , know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure &apos;s security researchers have examined the pay@@ load areas and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , create freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free sample files .
and if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share their work , explained safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa after a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits came into being by using the malware itself , advis@@ ing and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included in delivery is a adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually criminals then commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with dis@@ semination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey are confident that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file backup and scanning software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful registration , the perpetr@@ ators thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the type of data , the potential for damage is much higher than before .
in future , the perpetr@@ ators could take completely new targets on the Internet of things on the grain .
at the Def@@ con h@@ acker conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such blocked heating could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the offen@@ ders then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems to be small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear .
the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top falls slightly .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l for inver@@ ted back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space that is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the cargo height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should do his job a little bit qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering might be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency brake assist ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane support assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when manoeu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote lighting assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition and throt@@ tles the speed if necessary .
but the full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , nav@@ i , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI jack are located below the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from € 200@@ 00 , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only for dangers that are typical of air transport .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation for the man .
case of illness : when pays the organis@@ er
after their journey , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the case of a negotiated case , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly polluted the sea water .
the family felt that the trip was thus lacking - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the departure of the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was al@@ right .
he has not viol@@ ated his duty of information , thus the judgment .
especially since no contam@@ in@@ ants were found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber and resol@@ utely react to terrorist operations at the same time .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
we will not grant this triumph to terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if criminal off@@ ences would have to leave the country more quickly , the security and strength also increased the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to reach an implementation of the proposals until the parliamentary elections in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ four @-@ digit size for several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be punished again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire is am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the internet is ham@@ pered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed duty of confidentiality for physicians is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act a ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly spoke against Action@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sharp@@ sho@@ ers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality earlier .
he considers a general prohibition of full wear to be problematic for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t prohi@@ bit everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
one can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of simul@@ ating energy and action with new anti @-@ terror packages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; lef@@ tist party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet S@@ prü@@ che and a tightening of the right of residence bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
it th@@ rows itself regularly on the loop - here a picture of November .
but this is supposed to change : the right of appeal is to be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who are in professional traffic on the ambient road every night in traffic jam , when they drive over the free@@ way . Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler Straße exit at 700 meters .
drivers can then drive directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
the big advantage is that the traffic divi@@ des early , whereby the overall process is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes even beyond .
the needle eye on the B 51 is the reason for a short time before the Wes@@ eler Straße exit .
from here , traffic is only chann@@ eled in one lane over the motorway bridge .
the second lane had to be rebuilt in three @-@ quarters years ago .
the reason for this was that static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity , in order to absorb the heavy traffic two @-@ lane .
the responsible state company cannot say how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated work will continue .
however , with years to come , the bridge has an official remaining service life by 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal reserve , the state company consciously chose the weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities it is expected to be reck@@ oned .
traffic will be carried on on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the young theatre are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s house has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the production in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ häuser West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the young theatre will work together as part of a music theatre project in the coming season .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will be able to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in theatre play and theat@@ rical language placement are in planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
given the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of the weather
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , the chairman of the Stern@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars .
they have their names because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you lie awake for hours , morning is already far from the wake @-@ up ring to think no more to sleep .
that is anything but relaxing .
at least one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many causes behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schla@@ ef@@ el@@ eption und leep Medicine .
what one commonly understands , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an inhal@@ ation and through @-@ sleep disorder .
many people just feel sleep@@ y as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Medical Association in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this , organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can be stuck , but also drugs .
in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early w@@ aking is frequent in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are dependent on each other .
for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , you can sleep badly , wake up every two to three hours and begin to craw@@ l about everyday problems and worries , give an example to shoot .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you sleep with your doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , says We@@ eß .
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to allevi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out the causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
there is hardly any medical doctor in Germany , under@@ lines Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , if you have trouble sleeping with your family doctor , you should contact the family doctor .
this can be clari@@ fied with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
for example , in the sleep lab , doctors advise snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , in case of abnormal fatigue , sleep conver@@ ters or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t take a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after glu@@ ing , you go to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a probe at the finger .
in addition , a camera is drawing on the ceiling to the sleeping ends .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can put on a better sleep .
it counts : regular sleep and rising times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to offer
the former German swimming pool Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing inter@@ cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the Doh@@ a Short @-@ Track World Championship and at the same time set up his first world record .
now , the former DS@@ V ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler faces his criticism of ex @-@ team mates via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € and a jungle king 150@@ ,000 € no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page during the night .
the transport system in swimming sports is bad , but the dop@@ ing control is very good .
with this we can not compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ties had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of luggage guards arrested
professional thi@@ eves at the Düsseldorf airport
the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 took place on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and luggage posts as a band .
at 9 : 30 p.m. , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognized a band that was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft crimes .
since the middle of July , the two women and two men have committed several crimes and have been exemplary , work@@ able and especially professional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Speci@@ alists of the Cri@@ mean Com@@ miss@@ ary 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves who have entered Germany specifically for the commission of criminal off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , they caught up to a total of more than 15.000 Euro .
old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem to be the case at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a newly @-@ painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a gray house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demol@@ ished , will be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rent contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard work of the police against the project , called the area as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rol three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers moved away under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ isers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk in front of Sp@@ ät@@ i .
a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens are situated in the immediate vicinity of the building projects .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who lives here three children , is mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house @-@ projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it does not sound like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who desired a majority of police protection against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dit@@ ch , the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police between house occup@@ ants and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in , east of Berlin , was actually a traditional working class , which , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
house staff@@ ing and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under a large police order in a ver@@ itable street battle , many of the projects in the Riga area were leg@@ alized and sometimes still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tive liners from all over the world over the past few years : with them , residents from GDR times and former land@@ owners share their neighborhood .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them on pushed discs or newly painted facades , which were thrown with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as injury of the body are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most important part of the crimes are made from damage , which tend to coinci@@ de with new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a ten@@ ant near the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of in@@ security .
as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they are certainly not .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the ri@@ gs anymore .
for the studied architect , her road is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer consciously moved into the street of Riga - and remained .
this is why it was so important that the residents got their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former building gaps which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well searched , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what do you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for dra@@ gged who are anno@@ yed by color bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who draw , should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub neighborhood that can complain badly about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger administration .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group suggests that the honorary officials are more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is there now , the swe@@ e@@ the@@ art wo@@ ol@@ ly @-@ Nas@@ sau , which above all has a problem .
in this way , some - less mo@@ cking than on the multitude of desired duties had been targeted - meant when the administration wanted to write out the job .
an administrative professional has been sought , with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work .
but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le believes .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and minor problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon there will be new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for supplying the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the coun@@ cill@@ or &apos;s office to the municipality and to the job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far it is not possible to work on private dwell@@ ings , so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings need to be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will soon be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be tiled or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine reports .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do a char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , like Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but work does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it needs offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
thus , administration and honorary officials are also jumping here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense of time , for example with language courses .
whoever will develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anybody in Ur@@ bach will not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are problem cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing goes wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always motiv@@ ating others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two after recent events fear ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk can and should not exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also a topic among the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would make them completely ob@@ liter@@ ated .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; Reg@@ ine says .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
therefore , the main and honorary officials must look for activities locally and in the region .
they are always in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants will soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , politics sh@@ u@@ ff@@ les itself .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the bacher has already utilized capacity to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 persons , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they have to help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning .
the residents surprised the two and struck the aw@@ k@@ ward in flight .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies .
they fled to the city centre .
at the same time , the police deployed several squ@@ ab@@ bles as well as a police helicopter .
