<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sport pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of diversion with some colleagues at the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58 year old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays, they hunted in fast gallop home to feed troughs.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this speed, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 victories - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the system of ALRV, and he didn't even shoot himself for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid handed over to the man from Anhausen under a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sympathetic sportsman does not lack accolades.</seg>
<seg id="16">Silver laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid was long.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "says Langer," "" "because it is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been fostering the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master winner was admitted to the" "" "Hall of Fame of the German Sports" "" "on Saturday." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">The following are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Rwandan Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-rider Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the show jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious society emigrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza price was running.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trump Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that is both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential candidates are, however, in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep it small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulation." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively go back to regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, he has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would be increased, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the U.S., Trump and Clinton say almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical tea party wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be no party-internal discussion on trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-launch the coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement he wants to cancel." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "on the other hand, with its investment programme, Clinton explicitly wants to expand renewable energy and demand:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, both competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the Transpazilian trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are to be paid even better, called Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says that the minimum wage has to be rattled, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop rather than the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics preclude him, so the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least of the rich, wants that they pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara wants the most to be reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be slippery and he had hardly any heat, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke repeatedly of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper describing that Erdogan would have behaved like this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a sustainable coolness emanating from Putin showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the firing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to that time was rage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Setting up the cousins becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious accusations were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied that.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the first place, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after his last month has been halted by a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West because it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the continued resentment on the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool sentiment and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an alliance of outsiders in Russia and Turkey: two countries that have been driven away from the West and treated badly and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they hadn't even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately refrained from responding to a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey flowed the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov's Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of Putin's closest mutual trust for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it reads that without giving reasons, Putin has ordered the release of Ivanov from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Committee." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that later he was the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the administration staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding the draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince you?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow secret.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest Confidentified Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was touted as a potential president should at once pursue the Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "in his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said:" "" "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entrust complaining posts for four years." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third presidential term would have violated Putin's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic extent to this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of all bridge decks are at their place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>

<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>

<seg id="5">But strife is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation has been missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann writes:" "" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments must be furnished as social housing in future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can, however, also be built on the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the main point in the town hall is, as Bratmann: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build on such surfaces at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem, such as Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the fractions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to introduce investors as little as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, as viola, there is a sharpening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how is it compensating for the loss of other 1300 affordable apartments, whose extraction will expire in the coming years?</seg>

<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, so the planning-oriented spokesperson Nicole Palm, now outgoing connections should be bought from the city.</seg>

<seg id="27">At the end of the year, Fristen is running in the Weststadt.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go outside for playing but rather prefer to spend their free time staring on screens has been lamented by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created.)</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokemon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "taken prisoner."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person resigns every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that pursues 35,000 users, recently notified Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of tracked people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that want to bring people to "take 30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "to be active everyday," hit deaf ears because many public messages are dull and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also miners who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons' success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activator in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - winning a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lou Reson said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited them a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between their and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having planned the future during their long journey, it is not really true.</seg>

<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has lost no more competition, a winning streak that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafa ran through two turns, the picture was deceiving.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish beams and floor pears - in which Biles holds the world title - was lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She resumed again with 15,433 on the balance beam again - and still another 15,933 on the floor.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympionship in gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been involved in each summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three spires, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who had inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one under the female female was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and the USA cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected yet masterful gynectic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth heterosexual American who won gold at an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we don't look like gymnastics in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will only have four female dancers in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are a more expensive sport and Turner primarily in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for training, set up, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sneakers are in prosperous suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both of her athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer to the communities countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy-to-access gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the holding of the Olympic team gold and thanks, you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to terminate the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistance doctors who voted for a vote rejected him.</seg>

<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and gender-specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously the employers, the Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health were concerned with respect to the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form layers.</seg>

<seg id="11">Persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more improbable.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and city councils to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse due to" "" "hypersensitivity to ethnic and religion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption King, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be allowed by the police to set out shut-off tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "he recommends that voters should carry out identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">At present a voter must only name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report suggests not to apply removable ink to a person's finger if they release their vote to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this not only serves to fight electoral fraud, but also aims to protect the local government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election scandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral court decided that the acting mayor Luton Rahman was to be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical manner," and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the relic duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was particularly alarming for the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including carrying out ID cards to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "in his report it is said:" "" "as evidence has been indicated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background."

<seg id="22">Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit letter selection documents to stop "election harvesting."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the voting directory being used for immigration and social investment purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are eligible.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer around for your predator.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you approach you from behind, you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and move out of the shot line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Strike him with his knee in the lath and twist, while the attacker curbs against pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the barrel into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and direct the weapon to it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright shabuts his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller subdued his immune system and worsening of a serious test by leaking up some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk completed his course on a Euro ticket, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a flush-button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before finishing each object, he used a luminosity to show himself and us what he is going to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment that was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "" "brought some surprising results." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of dragging the flush button of a tension toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely dispulsive, but actually there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his trip through Europe Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine by travelling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public guts to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task put his immune system definitively under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he told:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he met his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test score showed a luminous number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet, which he refused to lick off after their luminous number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst I've cleaned in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more discouraged than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will do nothing here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company is equipping Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended with saying" "" "Call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick it like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associate lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a delay with a loss of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skelby and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">When they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had plasty holes, wooden boards were torn, trash was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the property management at Cornwall Housing said that she fears that the apartment is no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not so beautiful as a part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug trafficking, drug trafficking and excessive cries, disputes and curses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeleton, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, wooden boards were torn down</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to call the police regularly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing gave her and her partner this week forcibly from the estate, after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Delogierung was cheered by the lightened neighbours who said their life was made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They didn't care for anybody." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that they are finally away, it will become beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it had planned the family to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown site of the community house</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, since a deletion is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Delogierung on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the property management will have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as balances, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeleton received a fine, after having found guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial view.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skelby, who died in 2013 at a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were covered with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says that she will navigate renters who do not cling to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall told us that the Delogierung is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not cling to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "this goes to those who think they can behave without blame, and to those who have been harmed by such a behavior," "" "she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of a coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>

<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved south to the south and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg has been resumed, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofandingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>

<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg now the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales breakthroughs makes everyone who is asked to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where this has been handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequent due to the complicated traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it's also nice somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts that his family clientele is returning to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction to its clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buy records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section, to oversee it under the pseudonym NonAlleEinsamenmasculine-age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a plate are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov right?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I'm in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and stuffed wild before I stop, hold my hands and say something about something like this: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dressed the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and again buying items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was probably something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media channel, people who have heard about comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I led, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs now to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of followers of the record revision of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to see that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, from objects that awaken happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to focus mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flees from a plate stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while I planed through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came just recently here and said," "" "I don't own record players, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put them on a shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product lassily, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I don't have record players." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, who has dedicated the sound records almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer- and sexarpacked pop instead of experimental jazz drumming from the speakers - is it good to see such a diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange but calming psychic traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a window-shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." "" "it casts off with a dearest sigh." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers: urban Outfitters." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">While I'm sorry to wear jeans-hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research showed that the results of YouGov are right, they don't take into account the large number of female collectors in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday mornings with security not with the crumbling through plate shops of Berwick Street and sheets through plates while avoiding the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake moderator who raises nothing of middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would cause a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the Court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also concluded that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide shelter and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than feeding people who live" "" "in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the teardrop was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is generally operated and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure" "" "would be a catastrophe for these children, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungles had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were hit by a result of 43-7 in the deodoro stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in the handling, side-stepping, back-up, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad drip prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of it Fiji would have beaten a 15-man-team in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but probably not - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to marvel at the attacks GBs had fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell an and Co. as if one would run into travelling buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau complained in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mitchell's protruding tackle stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Yasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the re-whistle and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou competed by further weak Tactics of the GB team and stormed down to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still continues to learn.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB resulted in basic changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant stopplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South seeinsulans, whose fans sang, flags wave and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fiff sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain thronged South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than in these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 tough pieve, which enter the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the response of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they called for the second Olympic champion in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports, who laid such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.ter unlubricated effort, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets that glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not mirror the way of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing lies a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know if he was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did that.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if this is the right concept at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even greater.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervening morning trying something more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, who was a Captain at the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much this means, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>

<seg id="4">A small Franconian drinking water purpose association as a model for large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some time ago, it was called in the original sound in a contribution by the Bayerischer Rundfunk.</seg>
<seg id="6">Little later, the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia digged the purpose.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein group is" "" "Bavarian far as exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was a member of staff for 31 years, stands for 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water purpose association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes around 150,000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchberg, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a watwart company in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Board of Management in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, the budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," "" "said the chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high containers (1999), the redevelopment of a central computer control system (2004) and the redevelopment of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and you have always been innovating because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service for more than 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his part, praised Wasserwart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best watwart and he was a faithful cap.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view he called the well construction and the reorganisation of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the tubular breakage at church louder on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">One can also maintain the supply of Neubrunn only because the high reservoir of Pettstadt filled with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer of Lauter who follows Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens threatening the industry out of green electricity are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains at the liberation from the Renewable Energy Condition in the existing plants for so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ, now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissar Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent falls.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not being raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for power generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus the status quo of the previous arrangement is largely determined.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel has special significance for the steel industry.</seg>

<seg id="15">"more must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "climate and employment targets are also to be considered in the reform of emissions legislation," "" "said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation escalated further, when China's world's largest producer of producers threw steel into the world market in light of the weaker domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers toss price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, the import duties imposed on imported steel show effect, and on the other hand, economic prospects in China have brightened.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the price pick-up is.</seg>
<seg id="23">German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Finally ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">They produced more than six percent less crude steel at 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Industry Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the produced quantity went back to the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">Thanks to an improved order situation, the association anticipates rising emissions in the coming months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing does seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she occupied the subject of music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old is singing in an elderly choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several points of view, Erhard Hackler says of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "speaking and organizing herself, being able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors train deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not as fast as they can in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In elderly people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the German Association of Senior Citizens' Association.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher value, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses a lot of memories, often associated with positive emotions of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song lyrics and especially melodies, self-denyed people decompose on long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate simultaneously on one's voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone do not only concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that you experience through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise something for a long time, I will be better and awake beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a retirement choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with Internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Whoever wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we expect it to be a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express itself on possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities in recent days should have kept secret references to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is sitting behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but mostly they don't turn against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin there is a palace used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the present bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and Surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, it is not necessary to leave the necessary journeys into these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta CEO and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to instigate chaos while the country moves towards stability, improvement of economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, continues to benefit from having the kingdom restored to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest stop in the country's younger history.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games and World Records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia swam so slowly that at times he was no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte became the viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24 year old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24 year old participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming more popular in underrepresented countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">As most sportsmen walk in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as "Robel of the Whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "the English tabloid" "" "The Sun" "" "made fun with" "" "Dad Bod" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of freestyle, played no role.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Eric Moussambani took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="20">The appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 meters of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired frenetically at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of waste water will take place from 1 October 2016 for the area of sewage system Neudorf / Reuth / Welshahl 3,44 instead of 2,10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, at the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kulmbach, Kulmbach found that shelters are running for these sewage systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, also over- and undercover covers from the previous calculation period are to be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained that the serious charges increase in all three waste water installations by relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the previous calculation period, renovation and repair expenses were considerably reduced in all three plants due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for the Dahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf wastewater treatment plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Welshahl pumping station, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled, and after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge disposed and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "to these extraordinary expenses, the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still clearly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water installation in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance "are fully operational."</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years has been spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to stone houses, the situation for the aforementioned systems will continue to remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater-purpose unit could not be extended because it is a lack of deficient facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as an Asian caricature criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are non-bloomed, property-based tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All abortions are transferred to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past, Snapchat filters have provoked criticism in which they were accused of using the App Blackface promotional or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week struck some users a filter that gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowish face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended to be a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widespread over the photos that the filter was" "" "hurting" "" "was said to be unpleasant." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellowish face has been pulled into the degrading extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats's great audience of young people - who in terms of race are more different than their older opponents - might be more likely to anticipate sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "when one of Snapchats filters an image that is offensive to a user," "" "it is much more difficult for such things to stay unnoticed when it was the case," "" "said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on media and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the attitudes practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>

<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently set up a HR officer focusing on subrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu, on the other hand, said that she will close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="5">"intelligence intelligence, typically dismissed by high-ranking CentCom commmanders, regularly recorded a positive picture of US efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what has happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government officials under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts were," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, CentCom was publicly known to announce that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, it's so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command leaders changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force in life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," gave the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the Representative House Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "damaged morals among analysts and" "" "gave excessively little room for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that he had no clues on the intervention of the White House in the CentCom analysts with regard to a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation of the Pentagon's Inspector, which was received after complaints by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports of the Congress while the investigations of the General Inspector are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations also have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim which is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of intermediaries of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stipulated that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State should have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>

<seg id="10">As always the game will go out on Saturday, the Americans triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the roage of the Olympic Games, the trampoline's Zen</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a furious relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed down from the crossbow to the triathlete to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a flock of women with dimples, might have been among those well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV ads, if it were a swimmers, turner or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: aerial pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have a modest argument for my particular favourite, let me draw your attention to the discrete charms of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely noticed for the last 16 years that many of them, I had asked, did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian people for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has some kind of outsider charms, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonful trembling of his never-ending jumping - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means much like" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Budding victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to type, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their quest for gold continue to go up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They don't just chase the finish line or the starting wall, but also a further increase in TV transmission: the world or the Olympia-ords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatigued even while watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downward, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too, there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, too at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days starting at 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and objectivity of male athletes - as the male US turner recently proposed, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community to come to the air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police in the case of shot changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia pulling together right now?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was relentless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror attacks beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to lead the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven into the sides of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and have no other options except protesting, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the Eritrea border rise; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades, which have been enforced more or less in recent years, will exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are exploding under the surface after years of climax.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, above all in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they reside.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who are predominantly Christian highlands from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is illegally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012, was 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands protested against elections which, according to the analysts, apparently pledged from the government and were subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this time of turmoil passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this did not prevent the intensification of the internal envy of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an official city, run by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the base for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr Abdi," "" "is a very thin tightrope walk." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group, not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position to declare statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump withdrew in regards to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio oborator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr Trump to weaken the statement by recalling that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Trump, while he tried to focus his campaign on falling survey values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he attracted strong criticism when he thought the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then move back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction fails." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even better tone as his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a big advantage in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally attempting to excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing his attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal fellow combatants into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them hackers, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he pulled out the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by being aggressively under control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of dealing with each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he mocked the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump's apology as only a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, which didn't have Wi-Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were pushed out of Bedford Avenue Ladenfront.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie's business, replaced in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people used it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, it's also re-invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began to work in Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>

<seg id="19">There are sandwiches with bacon and cheese on the menu and there are garniings like capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>

<seg id="24">Recently Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and visited the club on a regular basis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation, this shark was allowed to return to the sea aboard the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats at about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks only get offspring with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark floats at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1,220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates at a rich 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this lifestyle shaped lifestyle seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "in any case from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">It was true that the evolutionist had long suspected that Greenland sharks will become stone old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland hairies are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland-sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-up tempo measured them, when they outfitted six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The loot nevertheless makes this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and seek cadavers, which are torting from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland-sharks, which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest of 502 centimeters was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore likely to lie in the early 1960s, when atomic weapons search for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest animal of 220 centimeters, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland-hairies, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lenticular nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters may be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the increase obviously leave at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not by chance that such Methusaleme live in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon peak, was captured in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal influences heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than in one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains Scheuerlein the Evolutionary Biologist." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uprising after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-election as it had requested Arab guests according to an employee. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the lifting of sanctions, according to Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade rate between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country grew strongly, the ambassador informed them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies are adopting existing connections with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "of course, the further commercial exploitation is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," "" "said Dzhagaryan." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran rose by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports in Iran rose by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery, agricultural vehicles and weapons," "" "said the ambassador." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For this year, Dzhagaryan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, the Russian foreign representation represented approximately 35,000 Visas, first of all travel visas, to Iranian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year were broken," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time relatively few Russians visit Iran, something that the ambassador hopes that it will change.</seg>

<seg id="2">The mini-strants from the pastoral care unit Eyachting-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next 60-year pilgrimage of all the ministrants in two years, the St. Anna's head of ministers has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally chosen for the Freiburg bishop's city, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the opening of the mercy of the Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Greol, Haigerloch, and Heiligenstad set their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and informed the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Minster of Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening with a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way the Minis made rages at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song of specially compiled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">Parish homes of local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and strenuous dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we passed through Furtwangen to Güstbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">On top of that, we took the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting distance, but at first we had to drop some 500 meters in the heat and then get out of it again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was in the evening a joint barbecue at the swimming pool.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Minis were visibly relieved and happy in the late afternoon at Freiburg cathedral and passed through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert was welcomed at the evening Mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the city of Breisgau.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raste last night in the men's team sprint in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the legend proudly made the legend when he stormed home to get a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick, after they took a modest sixth place in London, despite the Hoys' resignation in March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in due time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gary's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner won an olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes fell short after his turn, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner was holding it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up an olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally falling on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels like London with all the UK flags on the tribune." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velorom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23rd (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a hive of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the sprint, which starts today and will go for more than three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won gold in London 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he fought with representatives before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was drama in the background, the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April, in the midst of sexism and bulbbing reproaches, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, that has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thereby abolish all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy specified for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 workstations - direct and indirect - could be at risk with closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to Dominoeffects, as the smelting process consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzer, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Alcoa smelting process in Portland looses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL anticipates that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have come into force from November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice of termination, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "all potential impact on earnings on AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," "" "Kendall wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">This is the cliché story of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, certainly a new era of the Kardashian began.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim might have beaten her about the Vogue cover (they and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles an image book rather than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the ramble 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there have been clearly more" "" "celebrities that mob" "" "as" "" "models that are celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and distributor Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners don't like success for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV story, Jenners has always been a bit tense in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the mistletoe of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings boiled again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But running around on the Missmut seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's assistance centers are rejected annually by the municipal authorities, while the industry is preparing for the effects of further cuts to already overloaded transactions.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland there are already three out of five people - mostly older persons, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogiations and similar - at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Legal services of the municipality, which are already overloaded, are ready for further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">From June next year, it is foreseen that these legal centers will lose 30 percent of their federal funding.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Director of Queensland James Farrell's Joint Parliamentary Centers said that the latest survey of the National Federation of Communism Centres revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the decision of the German government.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland's Communes Centres are chronically underfinanced, which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relations, people with insurmountable and oppressive debt, families who have been dismissed by separations, workers who have been unjustly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal government will cut the resources by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We urge the Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to immediately raise these shortcuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have erect similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lighted the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exhibits its daylight side of the sun for nearly two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously thought by planetary explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, Venus -- in the course of several billion years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burnt away from the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As her hydro-gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus, which we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was demonstrated last Sunday that is used as a masking drug for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court CAS confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen should have participated in the runs of more than 50 m of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the International Olympic Committee (IOC) the opening of the B-trial and a hearing has been requested.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and requires Chen's full cooperation in the investigations," "" "cited Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news released about the positive sample at Danekova, the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "this was an incredible shock," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "explained the Athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said to be the banned substance of the EPO blood doping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample should also have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately reported his criticism of the Bulletin.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the athletes don't take the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doped nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier than his brother Tomasz.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny taking, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, the Danekova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association had not banned the entire Russian team except for systematic doping, even the nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, in swimming-sport, the earlier offences in China also ensured fierce disputes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium more than 200 metres of freestyle, I want to commit myself," "" "said Lacourt in French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focus of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping frauds," "" "said this one." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2014, Sun had been positively tested by the Chinese Championships on the stimulant of Trimetazidine but had to wait for a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes, among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to blackout ransom is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the damage software," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in recent months terribly fast.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches specifically for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final breakdown code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher when a ransomware is hit.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent had even had to interrupt their business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, it only supports the problem," "" "says Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure's security researchers have examined the payload areas and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, how they can pay per Bitcoin, create freely accessible support websites or decrypt for free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of potentially high and relatively risky profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share their work, explained safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware circa after a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits came into being by using the malware itself, advising and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included in delivery is a adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually criminals then commission spammers with dissemination," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey are confident that Ransomware can be able to repel ransomware by means of file backup and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful registration, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could take completely new targets on the Internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such blocked heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1.60 m high HR-V seems to be small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top falls slightly.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the cargo height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do his job a little bit quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>

<seg id="21">The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller reacts to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navi, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are located below the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from €20000, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around eternally, at night you lie awake for hours, morning is already far from the wake-up ring to think no more to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">At least one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many causes behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schlaefeleption und leep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one commonly understands, however, is the Insomnia, i.e. an inhalation and through-sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people just feel sleepy as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this, organic, psychic or behavioural factors can be stuck, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking is frequent in a depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are dependent on each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a herniated disc, you can sleep badly, wake up every two to three hours and begin to crawl about everyday problems and worries, give an example to shoot.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with your doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out the causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any medical doctor in Germany, underlines Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary dormitory medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, if you have trouble sleeping with your family doctor, you should contact the family doctor.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the sleep lab, doctors advise snoring with breathing dropouts, in case of abnormal fatigue, sleep converters or if you don't find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please don't take a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After gluing, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose goggles, a chest strap and a probe at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera is drawing on the ceiling to the sleeping ends.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can put on a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It counts: regular sleep and rising times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="5">At 9: 30 p.m., civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognized a band that was known to the policemen from past theft crimes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some linden trees, in between still another cobblestones: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem to be the case at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes to playgrounds, a newly-painted kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone has" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the facade of a gray house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, will be built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rent contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard work of the police against the project, called the area as "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patrol three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers moved away under the cheers of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and kindergartens are situated in the immediate vicinity of the building projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who lives here three children, is mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house-projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "it does not sound like a" "" "Kiez" "", "who desired a majority of police protection against vandalism." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, the Berlin interior senator and the police between house occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain, east of Berlin, was actually a traditional working class, which, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">House staffing and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under a large police order in a veritable street battle, many of the projects in the Riga area were legalized and sometimes still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become a magnet for tourists and elective liners from all over the world over the past few years: with them, residents from GDR times and former landowners share their neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on pushed discs or newly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year along with the words" "" "left autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as injury of the body are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most important part of the crimes are made from damage, which tend to coincide with new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenant near the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of insecurity.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they are certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the rigs anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her road is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here, one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer consciously moved into the street of Riga - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that the residents got their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: faceless newbuildings in former building gaps which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well searched," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what do you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for dragged who are annoyed by color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw, should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub neighborhood that can complain badly about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the Commissioner for Refugees in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the Achim Grockenberger administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group suggests that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is there now, the sweetheart woolly-Nassau, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less mocking than on the multitude of desired duties had been targeted - meant when the administration wanted to write out the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative professional has been sought, with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle believes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and minor problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there will be new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for supplying the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the councillor's office to the municipality and to the job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it is not possible to work on private dwellings, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings need to be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be tiled or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do a charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, like Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But work does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it needs offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thus, administration and honorary officials are also jumping here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense of time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever will develop the feeling that he can't help anybody in Urbach will not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "however, there are problem cases," "" "honestly," "" "people with whom nothing goes wrong." "" "the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always motivating others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two after recent events fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "some may call naive." "" "a residual risk can and should not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also a topic among the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would make them completely obliterated.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," Regine says.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Therefore, the main and honorary officials must look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants will soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics shuffles itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the bacher has already utilized capacity to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 persons, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they have to help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
