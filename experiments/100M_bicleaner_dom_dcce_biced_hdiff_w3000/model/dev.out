Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , at the meeting , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed should also be tac@@ kled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal between the two wor@@ sen@@ ed by Barack Obama &apos;s nuclear program has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech before the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor decides to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; cute dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone .
inside the house , the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , scri@@ bed on a white block : &quot; I am so sorry I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb made the cat@@ astrop@@ hic emergency call later .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took his life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
a day after the shooting at the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprised 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ ination to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons and said he had some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs &apos;s track when he returned from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as again in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he completed his doctorate in the spring in pedago@@ gy .
one of Lam@@ bs &apos;s long @-@ standing friends described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met together by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for several years .
he was the flock of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos; Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail two years ago both appeared on a summer fair .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter is writing and singing her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clean @-@ up and jo@@ king with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ Wake during the University Choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace .
classes are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made an emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss was called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plan to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as in the past year , but toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country . in the 2014 Christmas season 45@@ ,000 workers were employed .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees increases from October to December .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip the shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an im@@ pending documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it makes sense to me that I am a simulated t@@ ying and an ar@@ mes@@ hing distance from being with the Wales Princess on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time @-@ travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN boss calls again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of meeting the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria when dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate bo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
umps of arbit@@ rar@@ iness have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure mid @-@ June , a survey from Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 would say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent that say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other side , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favourite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ ump Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first state voting state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament was not in the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they expose their scholars , Republi@@ can voters keep tr@@ ump for real .
if you are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination most likely , according to a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten put their money back to J@@ eb Bush at the end of July .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it is apparent that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters view Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , tr@@ ump hits almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to b@@ umps leadership , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump raises the multi @-@ level support .
he got 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have made their mind .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support tr@@ ump say they have firmly assigned their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say , never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
yet Tr@@ ump is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; two months ago , the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse was in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of tr@@ ump will keep crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , it seems to do Donald Tr@@ ump .
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans were frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
the most expensive residential complex is located here in the Hob@@ by@@ en@@ weg - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - hence the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter most costs .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential neighbor@@ hoods , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
several tens of thousands of euros are ni@@ x - per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : in exceptional cases Munich is not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ schüt@@ z in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a well deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ s + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) worthy of 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received a kind help from Olympia @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto during his 28th year in the Champions League to the Bavaria @-@ guided tour of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the royal class , among them well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , defeated by Greek teams in seven European @-@ up du@@ els , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offen@@ sives efforts they often came to work .
the attacks were often initiated by reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely seen through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
one of the best occasions in half was Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as Olympic Stor@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown beat the head ball of the Pole by the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the Tor@@ wart Roberto par@@ ted with his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bav@@ arians with@@ drew their usual domin@@ ance game , Pir@@ äus was able to set needle stit@@ ches .
but at the door@@ keepers Manuel Neu@@ er , however , it was a dis@@ miss@@ al .
for instance , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye over the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New Zealand , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center alongside Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cabin , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the slain Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Go@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another .
before the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with bat@@ ches against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured and transported from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : in case of ren@@ unciation , the risk drops rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking , smokers lay the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent fl@@ ums in smokers .
it is not clear to the extent to which smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health up to the age of old .
in Germany , over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists stum@@ ble on rem@@ nants of the late Anti@@ quity at Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds were made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the c@@ ity@@ scape of Cologne , the museum is always consul@@ ted as a department for archae@@ ology of ground conservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now five @-@ handed .
from text documents it has already been known that in the fourth century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning con@@ forms significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the responsible EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is intended to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely suggest that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow obj@@ ections to be obj@@ ected against jud@@ gements .
so far , the parties involved themselves with one another on refer@@ ees , and there was no possibility of obj@@ ections to their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion over the past few months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work on an International Investment Court according to its own data .
there could then be clari@@ fied , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by major corporations , is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justi@@ fi@@ ance on which companies can limit damage compensation to tax@@ pa@@ yers , le@@ ash national legislation or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been critic@@ ised in particular that it should not apply to Canada &apos;s already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand described the plans as a great advance .
the Commission took into account essential points with the reform of the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in spring with other EU Trade Ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration was from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the Kla@@ as of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the timi@@ dly acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost overwhel@@ med by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places he repeatedly records on the map , about his meti@@ cul@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came from and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative fool .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent opul@@ ence .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should be carried out in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and close to the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already appeared and anticip@@ ates certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live is enough for guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2005 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
excessive in ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no list of records of the influential music media .
after very productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic parts .
this sixth record studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
since the smaller clubs have been dis@@ embark@@ ing long ago , the stage shows are shown here for the colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large @-@ lumin@@ escent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark @-@ kept ham@@ burger more !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens , which has become much more mature , returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without directing a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad @-@ enriched album .
one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can therefore throw the &quot; plate away . &quot;
only after an en@@ core does St@@ ev@@ ens complain , acousti@@ cally he plays a few older songs and finally bowed with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s frame has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited
the new leader of the Labour Party , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is supposed to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ming , and for the first time put up with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her to colleagues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to ins@@ ist on silence on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several newspapers in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow mini@@ stries have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in economics , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; st@@ acking &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference suggests that Labour must make changes to remove all the idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been a T@@ ory CEO over the dis@@ patch box in Parliament over the last decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who promised a different policy set says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the question@@ er of the Prime Minister is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from both &quot; skill &quot; and the dispute with re@@ fut@@ ers , and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economy Minister , will represent him if he doesn &apos;t take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also got the idea that other colleagues occasionally speak the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Theater , &quot; which is often associated with the frame of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television first in 1990 , the frame was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , even though critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound increased le@@ aps @-@ like data , which indicate a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid objective .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and achieved assessment since 2009 about the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont &apos;s 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares in Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper company were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs for his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to m@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or d@@ ön@@ er ?
both are done in the Kartoffel@@ keller , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ shareholder Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay posted potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a grill sk@@ ewer with meat and potatoes has been spinning in his store .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has now been registered by the Lebanese Patent Office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authority .
Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary international understanding also goes well with his customers .
Met@@ cash starts ground resistance campaign to combat algae invasion
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealer and supplier jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop owners who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to publish more details of its defense strategy on 29 September when wholes@@ al@@ ers of food , alcohol and equipment conduct its annual Investor Strate@@ gic Day .
there is much to be found in the game as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - over 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million in revenue per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business , and in the quantities on a high fixed cost basis , could cost around 13 million $ in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley states that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash was likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to equal sale prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and load @-@ recovery programs at El@@ an will grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious argument with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison shou@@ ting : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka had to sm@@ ite Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp disgu@@ ised a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gas@@ bou@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty much about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who broke a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he adapts to the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z at the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures Can@@ ber@@ ra &apos;s husband to return as a long @-@ term permanent part of the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick has quickly made the ascent to which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time out of the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , where he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , holds back refugees
Hungary declared emer@@ gen@@ cies and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegal in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted to Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who had fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the B@@ order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and shou@@ ted insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece are arriving . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ year @-@ bloc in a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would record more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not put its hopes on a swift action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency stand , which was proclaimed on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country is planning to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having stopped a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were employed at the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became an entry point in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the incoming business refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia , for a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military that is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across as they damage the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes under the new laws .
authorities are in the process of quickly re@@ pairing the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won her face to ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the elections .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more constant in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey Clinton lost a number of demo@@ graphics groups while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened .
your support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders will be back only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton has , however , still a big advantage for the older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance on the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the local elections say that they would support Clinton enthusi@@ astically when nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president becomes ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned by Clinton &apos;s supporters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the choice of voters are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Vice President casts a potential for the president &apos;s office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries would like to see him in the race - even though a third thinks he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than half of Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters say that their second choice would be far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead increases ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with be@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; be@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important to a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about their choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in the past month , not a single democratic candidate or a potential candidate for these elec@@ torate has emerged as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results in some important features among voters of the party &apos;s primary elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
multi@@ tudes consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 per cent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server will continue to be provided as Secretary of State during the term of office , most Demo@@ crat voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third are satisfied .
public opinion for this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views have become worse from Clinton .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time 55 percent of those entitled to vote are also regarded as non @-@ honest and not trust@@ worthy throughout the country .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump however get good marks on leadership .
from the six candidates we tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut the best in hon@@ esty .
a majority looks more hon@@ estly rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in country @-@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest news from C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime , the two candidates have lost half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose a dramatic footh@@ old .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support country @-@ wide tr@@ ump in large numbers . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month to 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passed dr@@ unk@@ ers among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen down the deepest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is in the poll@@ s - he lands with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
in view of a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question the faith of Tr@@ ump .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees Celsius has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
in contrast , bathing temperatures continue to provide the Mediterranean : in the east , it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood loaded with the death of Bar@@ uch College @-@ virgin
nearly two years after a student died during a sho@@ cking ritual as a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder acc@@ la@@ im were submitted against five persons .
members of the Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transfer to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he was loaded with blin@@ king eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , thus the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; says Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the following morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the first five members for murder of the third degree .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of a deportation and formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organisation which - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood re@@ vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increase is coming , and the land@@ se is down , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the procedure .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first increase in interest rate and took 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus when it begins to increase interest rates but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that the entire excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of interest rate increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effects .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market saw last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be reduced from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what has happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , in the past 35 years , the market is mostly upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the last six days after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , boss investment strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to rise later in the increase cycle and the return it starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases promote it often .
in the current case the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near to its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed statistics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop might be ris@@ ky and throw up the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken the whole year to an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all development cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing heights are put in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months up to now .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest rate increase and the pattern is rather similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than stocks , if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the raising cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to yields between longer and shorter bond issues and leading to a down@@ turn in the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
Jones means that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity continues - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in large and large , companies that handle the greater part of their business activity in the US will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will get worse because an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond very positively to three months after an initial increase in interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet sur@@ passed a weak balance sheet after each of the interest increases 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their equi@@ val@@ ents with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside of the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the increasing amount of dollars .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts have different opinions on how quickly that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took the broadcast The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also told BBC @-@ boss that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from his commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its just under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC Director General rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and public education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I think it &apos;s important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element in BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sports to compete for commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took The Voice an - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced &quot; in special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the next time it star@@ ed in an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other lines of The Voice in the future , or to give money to the fee ah@@ ler for other entertainment formats .
net sales slow@@ ed in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down spending in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there is evidence now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has been evolving over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G selling index The Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to buy their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is sw@@ inging , and we may possibly see that growth is less@@ ening .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for decreasing revenues .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers revol@@ ved around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 was spending a little over £ 1 online .
for some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of shopping is now done through web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane collap@@ sed at Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ m .
mour@@ ners crowded , mostly dressed in white , the route to pay their respect , when the first of the dead came their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance grav@@ ey@@ ard .
the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before had a construction crane rush@@ ed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the bodies were approved for burial when the Saudi king suspended a san@@ ction on behalf of the Bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the corp@@ ses of 29 people who were killed as a crane rush@@ ed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Grand Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ ling will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have left the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was forbidden abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rush@@ ed into a courtyard of the Grand Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also led the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s grand mo@@ cha as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay hospit@@ alized .
government officials stated that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) must be paid to relatives of the killed and the same sum of permanently injured .
other publishers receive half of this amount .

it is claimed that Br@@ its lay their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes .
if you are skill@@ ful using a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British employ more and more professional tra@@ des@@ men to carry out their jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new CEO of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has meanwhile out@@ dated .
therefore King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open up 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions are made by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more feminine single households than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to move this more strongly to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed leading companies , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year earnings and sales , after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up to 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and deportation .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he has been legally acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the tor@@ ney @-@ attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel , the investigation revealed that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial difficulties .
this fact was divided by the chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , Justi@@ ces Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the dis@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence constituted that at no time an asset belonged to the association .
the sports officials would have charged only expense compens@@ ations and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we were facing the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , the bread@@ winner of the financial office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed with : you can manage the money freely , only no debt can be made .
furthermore , with appropriate financial success , reimbur@@ sement of expense allowance had been retro@@ active until 1991 .
therefore one part of the expense compensation was paid off only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
this was the reason why flat and not detailed accounts appeared , the former chairman explained the proceedings .
the accounts and audi@@ ob@@ ooks administered the two defend@@ ants together , said the second accused .
the judge asked why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association didn &apos;t care in detail for the financial services , it was important to have only the freedom of debt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 an official investigation was started on account of abuse of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were appropri@@ ations , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to its statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent had no answer to this for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
this transfer has been formulated as &quot; damage in@@ dem@@ nity . &quot;
why claim compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the association was never damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With him you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never paid a cent salary , charged only mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
he charged the association 1,000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual expense was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were not able to present accurate documents for the early years .
these were no longer stored after an audit in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to the mil@@ eage .
he explained in his statement that all the displac@@ ements were carried out in cash , and he had to go to the Bank from his place of residence to the Bank in Blei@@ burg .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard runs another 30.000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts that have been running for three years , the Compu@@ Stra@@ ese will be reli@@ ed on further jobs in the company &apos;s split @-@ up .
the sub@@ missions at the US @-@ Compu@@ Ser@@ terri@@ esen Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division .
the company announced on Tuesday that costs of 2.@@ 7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved .
the step will lead to a special burden of around 2.@@ 7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not been completed for three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard share sold 2.3 percent after the exchange .
the corporation raised with printers from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto is currently split into a new company : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company , apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both parts of the business should be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers according to his services continued the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
in doing so , the revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only late re@@ acted that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more stores online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
but a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be largely rejected : 54 per cent said , by contrast , 35 percent were appro@@ ving .
61 percent is positive that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed reject , 20 percent would be for it .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show
on September 27 , connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility will be at the heart of the trade fair .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show on Thursday under the motto &quot; Mobility . &quot;
the wide public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
the organisers of the V@@ DA Auto Union expect approximately 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : erup@@ tion of violence on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have applied for several hundred refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ nar@@ as and water @-@ lights .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the erup@@ tion of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water @-@ light ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officers initially continued to use pe@@ pper@@ mint spray .
afterwards , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a bit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant woman and evi@@ dently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police press spokes@@ persons also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether interest rates are raised for the first time for almost a decade .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is based on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death cap at Delta State University left an excuse for cancellation
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called out the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency department that police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller about his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I am so sorry I wanted to und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the not@@ ebook , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that I called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he isn &apos;t going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car aside , fled to the foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , like his life c@@ law on the website of the university .
stars who have lost their luck charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some st@@ res@@ sive years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group remo@@ del@@ ing .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1000 executives will cost the Group restructuring the workplace .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and re@@ ass@@ esses the equity holders &apos; equity .
the objective of the real@@ ignment is to generate a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , informed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no more management board for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
managing director Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for managing director Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with whom the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
to date , the organization of the workforce of 120 000 was complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which accounts for three quarters of annual sales of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the courts have been stopped .
that divided the union .
the topic of talks should be the retirement regulations for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be able to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the pilots &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa moves routes to the group &apos;s own cheap line Eu@@ row@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ning in the South &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger are visible in the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left external defender to cry and close it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up the hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was introduced into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic plays , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet sent to Sha@@ w &apos;s account : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
based on this : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V defeat
the UK def@@ enders have an additional incentive to recover until the next June with the European Championship in France .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball traveling in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I could not see the attack on Luke .
Mor@@ eno said in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , instead returns a summary of the 2012 movie version adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this was not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website , and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is devast@@ ated by the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ si@@ fying , Th@@ need kn@@ itting Once @-@ ler , a ho@@ ck@@ ly , sn@@ u@@ chy character , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row to a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokesperson said that the text was probably hit by Cameron &apos;s electoral circle .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to push Pakistan into the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a forward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t bear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
related News : Adam Ly@@ th out of the England Test Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that the cri@@ cket players are oriented to results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
hopefully if he kno@@ cks out further gro@@ c@@ eries for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his position , even if he did not get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man .
the question of how much time a test hit comes to set its character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I think highly .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this of course depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , what an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and four Qui@@ cks would get , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed player has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player &apos;s cra@@ p .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he got three hundred re@@ ars immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar S@@ afar S@@ afar is a back @-@ up sp@@ inner in the ca@@ des , and in my limited handling he was very impressed by me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no great number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ lah he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team@@ riders do not determine the schedule .
and you have to remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain exit from the EU ) could gain additional gains if the economy goes into a sl@@ ur@@ ry until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s unprecedented re @-@ trial strategy to hold Britain in the EU is getting deeper with each day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which stri@@ pped strongly on Tuesday because of Europe .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at re@@ affir@@ med that some member states are deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on their own debt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they mostly do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and shows that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capitals where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long @-@ out like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a dimin@@ ishing power .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will be pulled out to help the British , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , quite in the SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has gained nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost , and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press notes , as they did not have in 1975 during Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s inspired referendum , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name for themselves as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Stra@@ it @-@ Ban@@ ana &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
to this end , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening foreigners and pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noted that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had opposed the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on his back on Monday - I told him that he had no time to waste me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I &apos;ll press it in a friendly way - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ bst@@ off tendency and the wild gra@@ ff@@ iti of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ismus can certainly say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but fighting to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s phrase - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants and dep@@ u@@ ties after all the reports at their conference on Monday evening .
whatever the ear@@ thy bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic con@@ ten@@ tions .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign for leaving - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government on power , which I was reminded on Monday by something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bas@@ eline report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he justified his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said the public expects that the statement of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose management had previously been approved by British American Tob@@ acco Packaging ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received by reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the P@@ he &apos;s tobacco management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of the damage of most products with most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been premature as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong addi@@ ct dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
with the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for publicly publishing programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard @-@ disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Upper House Communication Committee on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to pay the broadcast fee , which I do not consider medium or long @-@ term for a good idea , you should at least focus on programs that others do not make or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for ratings &quot; because of the ambition of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC report what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that BBC shows like East@@ on should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they perform their tasks and they can argue if they go to their seemingly holy missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
in the broadcast fee Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
of course you think all , we all think that one gets a great value here for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the $ 150 , ask me if this is true because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former S@@ Sky@@ - and Channel 5 Chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their ethics mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only a little from BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and they should take an example at the public television broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada in &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ caster alli@@ ances to make it available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des are changing the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on @-@ on of the Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depth brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms do not usually react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ azi@@ ani determined that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones are carrying TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred into the worms where they turn the modified Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

&quot; important announcement : from 15th to 18th of September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) you can read the characters of the London Under@@ ground and the trademarks of the DL@@ R line which turns into a picture of a tank .

one of the par@@ ody ads produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
many artists engage with activists in protest movements to work and notice that they have to go out into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapons trade @-@ plac@@ ards gre@@ ets the commuters in the subway .
the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was astonished about the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the ce@@ ase@@ fire - by a laying of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic , shad@@ y corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger with bright colours and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need right now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L where exhibitors sp@@ urn fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uniquely shaped head of combat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which delivers outstanding rep@@ lication effects inside the target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ wit@@ ted complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entry in student residence halls ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ out : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ on , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly don &apos;t love or hate mar@@ m@@ ite , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not talk even if your eyel@@ ashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people live .
people &apos;s rooms often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people attract and wear their under@@ wear .
based on this : do not remember to start a relationship at university
intro@@ vert is a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ ble culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closes by che@@ eks .
since you start the university at the height of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to put themselves sleeping when you drop .
to steal food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to operate themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with a more balanced way than my room@@ mate who added a dish@@ washing liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the right to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl in my corridor asked her neighbours if they had something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an examination in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left their own music , shut their door and went to their three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would happen to move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be deeply embarrass@@ ing if you have a room@@ mate for your future spouse , take care of them , to separate themselves and see them every day and maybe witness how they are moving all together friends to themselves ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his not locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fine as it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
place a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety by hiding - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water that you then put into the freezer - but do not stap@@ le your possessions at the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single parents , low @-@ income bene@@ fici@@ aries
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds row houses for people who do not have much money in the middle Fran@@ con@@ ian corner valley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the self @-@ educ@@ ating mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in how quickly cheap living space can be created : he builds row houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain here for a large part .
in view of the flow of refugees , we need sufficient housing in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a row of terra@@ ced houses only needs a lot of space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if people are accommodated in blocks of living .
each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I am legally implementing my project .
the threatening Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ verordnung ( Ord@@ in@@ ance Reg@@ ulations ) make it especially complicated .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ty .
it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .

but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after the installation , because they get an error message telling us that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made this more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may be switched on half way and this could lead to a dis@@ continuation of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto against his clearly @-@ leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup runner stressed before the start into the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to the cure .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the Cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation received by the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record players who cannot bring up the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office is looking for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ stadt Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommodated themselves under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new focal point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides consulting you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation dra@@ gs it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advis@@ ors immediately receive information on questions such as care insurance or health care insurance benefits .
for years we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often caring relatives are left alone .
there are infinitely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many performances of the insur@@ ances are not seldom used because the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new manager Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ine and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physio@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders in particular in demographic change .
this necess@@ it@@ ates a good distributed infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration ceremonies , the district office also devoted itself to the association with old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ alizing . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5th September at the age of 92 , as the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus shared on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus abandoned an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as stated in the show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 , he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the Treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and the conversion of the Lob@@ ko@@ witz to the Austrian Theatre Museum .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beating a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on the way to Sal@@ mün@@ ster on foot from Bad So@@ den .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young people and put his fist on his face .
the victim suffered from a nas@@ al insert and bleeding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car to their apartment and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
under the help of a hammer , one was beating on the face and the th@@ igh of the victim .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical treatment .
until now there is only a vag@@ ue activity description .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been around 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was clothed with a pair of jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ st U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on the 1st of October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen reti@@ res , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a point in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the fel@@ low@@ ships met years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who is currently completing her specialist training at the Ver@@ dener hospital and who wants to get into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ lers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just ph@@ oned it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of running its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to dwell in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in an honorary position in the DRC prepar@@ edness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) has specialised in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ lers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a house @-@ doctor .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a talk room .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely re@@ done .
a total of 50,000 euros is given to the mil@@ ler as part of a funding programme of the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Saturday Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l about 2000 patients come to the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , in the north@@ western German average practice , it is about 500 .
there is another doctor &apos;s office in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have found herself , she would have gone too .
by the way , anyone who visits Müller &apos;s consultations will continue to look first and foremost in familiar faces : the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the field stands will take over .
with their farewell ended in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel fel@@ steh@@ ausen , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly began to feel it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will surely see many patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square metre plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have always pressed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also high on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister for Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to submit a asylum request can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to continue travelling to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this is how the Interior Minister , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s , did not see Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outside border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to not smu@@ ggle its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees in the night hours on Tuesday tried to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police picked them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles are constantly arriving with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action .
in the coming days his country will reck@@ on with about 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would re@@ vo@@ ke Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Belgrade government , however , denied that it is it that people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , at least in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , and in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary added , so the police told us that we were to go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
thus it could actually come to a somewhat further west route for the postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control opportunities &quot;
Croatian Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared adequate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call him details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently testified to the country as regards the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees will continue to travel to the Croatian border .
the Serbian Minister of Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be very high levels of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees , on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields for 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which has been accused of providing insight into yet un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the collected information , insi@@ der shops should have been made on the financial markets .
according to the investig@@ ators , more than 100 million dollars were launched in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are finally caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial against 32 other defend@@ ants in this case continued .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should act in both the US and Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Par@@ ade@@ platz in Mannheim .
people do their own err@@ ands , partly fast pac@@ ed walks , partly co@@ z@@ ily ram@@ bling .
you control the two stops of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the par@@ ade@@ platz .

puls@@ ating , pr@@ el@@ ude life with splendid autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four big boards each with the title &quot; Before I die I want to .... &quot;
with this action the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce pointed out to her twenty @-@ year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer .
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ eg is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as the volunteers .
while some pass@@ ers @-@ by spontaneously reach the chal@@ k and &quot; affir@@ m my life , &quot; &quot; read &quot; the camper through the USA , &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer for a long time , &quot; others stay shortly , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet , &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the br@@ ink of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which , together with the Car@@ itas Federation , is the carrier of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce .
therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the twenty @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to express himself publicly on the boards is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter .
the theme of death and death continues with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people .
an app@@ rais@@ al that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and mourning companion belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
through personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was looking for volunteers , she immediately announced it and had been part of the establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
all of them are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another perspective , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ances and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as further education and supervision of the death and mourning companions .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
there , too , other personal wishes can be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier giant lowered his prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the fiscal year that ends in May , 20 cent less than in previous forecasts .
according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ transporting heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November onwards .
the company said that it nonetheless expected the result to be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company achieves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS who plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter finished on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve analysts at Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the analysts surv@@ eyed expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping in recent years , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result was falling due to higher labour costs in freight business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on its most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week seated around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time for almost a decade .
the wall picture of the United States is im@@ pending against them at one end of the decorated two @-@ story session hall .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the Central Bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the short @-@ term interest rate at the end of 2008 .
although most data in the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in global financial markets may frigh@@ ten the cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to intensi@@ fy this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and be only a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they can observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which will ins@@ ure on itself the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets expect a delay of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts sof@@ ten the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy keeps the set in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would soo@@ the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the liber@@ als compla@@ ining that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and near the level the F@@ ed saw as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary action of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world sent together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors feared that a slow@@ down in China &apos;s economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market recovered slightly this month , and the Dow is now nearly 10 % lower than May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence affects the complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be taken into account technically in decision making .
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion spark@@ ed confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ating interest raising , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives und@@ o these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability to the first place only during a severe crisis such as the market in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement of the Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest rate because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poz@@ nan , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should prec@@ ede the time .
need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yeah , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 sequences .
every Thursday she does it in asylum seekers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , the whole thing is different than at a real school .
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ di@@ at@@ rical Association Rio Grande promotes healthy feeding nutrition
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition during lac@@ tation is . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who are painted on breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the proposal for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof should be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around building on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ complex are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council session , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously approved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before , the Board decided , inter alia , to apply for a statutory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid building plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; permission was given for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ addle roof with non @-@ bearing top and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , it was about the g@@ utter , which should lie below ten degrees for energy reasons - different from the planning plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the g@@ utter does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - with Bernstein &apos;s Municipal Council generally rather restric@@ tive when it comes to exemp@@ tion applications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the case of gy@@ ms , it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and of the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated at around 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tude promotion .
in the next step of the process , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the district council office .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is demonstrated by the surprising plans of the District Hospital of the county which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
however , a decision on this is the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority were to move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with f@@ isher and the existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
the employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
employees are informed of the plans .
the change has spark@@ ed the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
with the question of who to take the following , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who declared himself ready to take the lead from October 1st and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in the inner station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ora , which still has 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , if the current renovation was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , opposed the rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , is to be used as shelter for asylum seekers in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decide this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss was unable to say , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house where fishermen have worked for over 30 years as a chief physician , I have not given it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened with closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are called tonight at the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) .
although the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .
in the past season , the Bad@@ ener drove a painful defeat in Bh@@ c and made something good there .
Jag@@ dim with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( District of Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in action , as the police informed .
after a shooting a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the criminal police investigated .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rheinland @-@ Pfalz victims of violence crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old began to kill the young@@ sters and cast their corp@@ ses into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ h@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police told on Wednesday .
in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening , who in fact admitted the specification and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the dead .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after attending an autumn festival in Rock@@ h@@ ausen on the eve of a visit to Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim .
in surveys among friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ h@@ ausen , where the body was found .
the arrested gave the authorities to the police authorities to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the corp@@ se into the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a stop to him .
the further investigations are to bring information on the more immediate circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of gaps in accommodation
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing bau &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be completed in Germany this year .
that means 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial shelter .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the growing number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable concessions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is pushing a housing deficit that will grow from year to year .
currently there have already been around 77@@ ,000 housing units in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study , compla@@ ins .
many professional people therefore lived in large cities in emergency rooms in flat @-@ room flat areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita in recent years has declined again for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve the social housing construction .
this could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended for a limited time .
in addition , according to the Alliance , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary .
the programme for refugee accommodation in the German state bank Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the currently available 300 million euros was rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free travel : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary there is practically no passing through , as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces that passing through Slovenia to the north is without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shad@@ owing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported to the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had set off its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws which came into force on the same day , moreover , render superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
according to media reports , most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town S@@ id together with the bus as well as with taxis .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not reach the border fence .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
min@@ e@@ fields are now to quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 .
shortly before the conclusion of the gate on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south@@ western border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years of imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Trans@@ it@@ ons &quot; set up at the border , of which almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition from R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
there were 13 families with small children and two elderly people among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically no one has a prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ it@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the tr@@ ash that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
locking grids were broken down and one of the recording @-@ camps in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the purpose of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the further drive to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing regularly smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot .
mayor crossed &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy with the clearing after the bridge festival on Sunday when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
but because Germany had surprisingly set up railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein an end for them , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance , and together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars were ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red over the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first tasted the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
one man was not allowed to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers switched to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE train to Passa@@ u , in order to try after the short announcement that the railway traffic was stopped in Germany , but still to try to cross the border .
the regional train was stopped at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ ably soci@@ able , on the day before a two @-@ leg course sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends another tens of thousands to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately to establish structures to ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or has raised the position of the Hungarian government in the ha@@ ze circle of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to note that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to establish decent conditions for vulnerable people in the face of the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 3@@ 5.000 winter@@ proof quarters
Konrad has all hands to do with the spreading of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos at Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &apos;s first @-@ record center has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , who had come to Austria on Monday , was without a great whi@@ rl@@ wind , said Con@@ rad and praised the organisational &quot; performance . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 districts in the he@@ ur@@ ish year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial govern@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him not to create quarters for the coming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it works well in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , explaining how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator will also expect great expectations in the ORF promotion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that the lod@@ gings have to respect a certain height of the towel rack or the size of the overhead lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad with his experience that he is more successful as opposed to the ministry of the Interior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier don &apos;t bear the costs of the Republic as they themselves stated .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own quest for a district has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as it is currently impossible to accommodate those affected without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other sites should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the chief executive exercises criticism of the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday has added the further procedure in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
the asylum seekers , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria again controls its borders again is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the German action for P@@ ühr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T is drawn in , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try them to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later also to acquire which ones to acquire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from S &amp; T , 1.7 million euros have been invested in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is lease from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the arcade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to hand over the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade : after all , she now has a new business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything is now revol@@ ving around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before that , several weeks have been re@@ mod@@ elled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought about whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location at which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the big city of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been moved from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I am most interested if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are in a tran@@ ce when looking at a hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with the latest security .
perhaps it is due to the fact that a beautiful bag of every outfit is inv@@ ali@@ dated .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects some to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for set@@ ters .
whether it is alien@@ ated , journalists , or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy are revealed - the candidate for the U.S. presi@@ dency is power@@ ing up the campaign .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ lichen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the wine village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant town are related to it through nin@@ ety corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about tr@@ ump .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt Art , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous kids , including tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the hearts there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that tr@@ ump is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit a big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , was &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a local for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
first real estate sales were the corner@@ stone of the real estate group in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to homeland in the long term failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not record tr@@ ump , because he once had been cut off without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally striking statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the wine @-@ gro@@ wer in retirement looks rather dist@@ anced to the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always about thousand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he think Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ in a visit , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 68 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he did not win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws in the US at the time of his grandfather were like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says winery Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , inter@@ viewed for the dump for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the U.S. aw@@ akes interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den national park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise dominates the ratings despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in the Today ratings .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no part for Australian TV viewers , since sunrise scored 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared with Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today showed a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in recent months , the gap to sunrise has been closed .
in August , Today was an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September , an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators has risen to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar von Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently de@@ fun@@ ct father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour there was a full 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that did not manage to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki apparently have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly evi@@ dently who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was wrapped up in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows on the day before three two , you may have accidentally added a note to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have been in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and therefore called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; their answers could become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the tor@@ so .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
from the first day Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought it throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week , the house visit made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now locked up without reservation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a fight like the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start which Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on its Inst@@ agra@@ m .

free voters call for the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ aut@@ um@@ nal retreat in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt . &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers in order to protect the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get uph@@ eav@@ als in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sunday faction of the Free voters conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually , other main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will super@@ impose the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd that was demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ stret@@ i District , 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , deputy minister of the district , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police deployed tear gas and then fired into the air before it res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known for being able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there have also been protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th century .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal which has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned , but there are still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
the plan is to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and living .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
the investor question is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded as well .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the property that is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , already some months ago bought and the building can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly presented plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months it was negotiated , g@@ ag@@ ged , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement at the Small sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ esting , the S@@ ME Em@@ den Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Em@@ de Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which submitted to the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we haven &apos;t yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in the discussion for months .
hef@@ ty reactions among sea bu@@ den@@ ers who came to the meeting called out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea bu@@ d owner and board member at the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge pad that over@@ looks any other building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like some other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be entire bus calls for this to be reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is happening on the well @-@ maintained area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the construction plans were still variable .

Google launches double @-@ donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double @-@ donations campaign that will raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who had fled Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark train and bus cru@@ ises , hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately seek help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / de@@ filed to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many fled from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya devast@@ ated by the war .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who do not receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely dissolved and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was partially dissolved only at one percent and partially with only about two percent .
in addition , the results of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , and the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose levels of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching bigger decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and resulted in a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity surgery to die about 29 percent less likely over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a theme that is increasingly popular in Bell@@ et@@ r@@ istik : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be particularly interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück @-@ readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could set up a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries on the refugee crisis ad@@ mira@@ bly is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must reflect on how the killing in their countries is less@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on 11 September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used force , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the last 4 years
poison control centers in the US report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swal@@ low highly alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , thus Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand dis@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centers report , rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them are going to be in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some kids visi@@ bly drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
YouTube videos show how young@@ sters drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens allegedly mixed dis@@ infection agents with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very appealing for children .
dis@@ infection agents contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would not leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ dis@@ infection agent within reach of children , and when children come to it then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had taken four sp@@ lashes from after straw@@ berry @-@ du@@ ften@@ berg disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is referred to as drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ apped her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand @-@ dis@@ infection products out of the child &apos;s reach .
in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths due to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the hi@@ cc@@ ups of disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by placing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to the disinf@@ ect@@ ant and ex@@ iles her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and imposed disciplinary action on the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

lack of title competition in Scottish football bor@@ ds Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the ran@@ gers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they do not show any highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ ger .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic struggles to fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now with five points lead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ à said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
it is so important to stand together now .

Hear@@ ts set on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts performed 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the defender was later lifted - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned integrity , I have not commented any performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rup@@ tible Hi@@ bee was rebu@@ ked after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Stür@@ mer and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glas@@ gow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mc@@ Allen is happy to win against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Der@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen was desperate to fight Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to win a seventh consecutive League victory giving them a lead of five points in front of Celtic Cafe on top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Allen said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of that kind did not win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent higher than the U@@ K@@ s , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure over the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ el commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken disturbed the process
since security personnel were unable to make peace , the police called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officers could put the stur@@ geon into custody .
a breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 year old 0.@@ 89 per mil@@ le .
the adolescents were picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 per mil@@ le and remained in custody .
why I become a witness of an ec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison@@ ous sy@@ ring@@ es .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to enter all the details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come from the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ins .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he was referring to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ a because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt sound test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I &apos;d like to go about raised head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I was asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a fraud .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to believe me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reig@@ ning president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the view that it will be personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and drive me off , and I have no doubt that what I say makes them think about it right now .
but I have now arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s Fru@@ str@@ ations levels have been set up with the long @-@ term cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to say that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the ill @-@ beaten master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse @-@ strip , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my colleagues er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it had also been on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes back ri@@ vals for claims to ring battles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described critics on the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster &apos;s coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed comment about the Storm Team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ kling of his team and said that at the tac@@ kling they only concentrated on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers at his team vo@@ iced him confi@@ dently , as it means they worried about being beaten by the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this appears again and again - I didn &apos;t hear Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about the ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that nothing has changed in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focal point , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is already com@@ ical , as this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragon won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soccer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne talks about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a divorce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build up more trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they probably didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos vs Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points a bit tension@@ ing ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will still meet them in one phase .
the Storm Team released this weekend because they won the right to either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 deposit on drugs
a man who may have a lifetime penalty due to his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escap@@ ing at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of criminal proceedings , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a $ 200,000 deposit as security together to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ ent statements of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he gives his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and stays at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab breaks apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 at Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to devi@@ ate to the left at the last moment , as the police informed .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident manufacturer tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es for sending pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took over the phone of the girl when he was sleeping , logging into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the bewil@@ dering messages and instantly al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then said to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction - that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him , but said that it was happening because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ lia .
he was asked for his interviews with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said that he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have taken in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the obligations on 25 January and did not appear before court at a hearing on 24 March of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders as one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in his offen@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit in this case but was held in custody on charges of other pending cases .
he was admitted to the directory of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
slu@@ dge switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are picked up outside the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left people from fear of discovery and arrest more and more on smaller border cross@@ ings
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn River Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they had come to the German side on foot over bridges and rif@@ les .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and passed on to the registration .
compared to the beginning of the week , more refugees arrived at the Munich Central Station compared to the beginning of the week .
around 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8@@ am , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ners of tropical Storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest Exp@@ ected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air streams into the country , divided the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the drop@@ out of the Trop@@ ical Storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who had moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning is also to be expected in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ see circuit with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
the sun will rise again on Friday .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 is above all a movement among the compact cars that are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations fell to this segment only in August , according to the German Federal Police Office ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days September 17 to 27 ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , among which also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra rival Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
he enters the trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan publisher wants to find its position in the rapidly expanding segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti adapts to the design line of the brand with its curved lines .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications with 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are deser@@ ving
the Federal Constitutional Court issued an ex @-@ prisoner of the Pen@@ al Pen@@ al Pen@@ al of Te@@ gel who had spent months in a too small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man , who is now on the open foot according to his lawyer , has been moved to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant for the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the State of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and re@@ mitted the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was issued , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
in April they said a det@@ ain@@ ment to a det@@ ain@@ ee because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ deser@@ ving .
in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday that an in@@ mate had reached a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff was located between 15 and 21 hours daily in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
in recent weeks the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to ra@@ ckets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not staff@@ ed due to lack of offspring , 19 are to be tra@@ cked away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what is coming to Germany ?
according to the German Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) showed determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , it is estimated between 35@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) .
the lack of housing , but above all in affordable rental objects , is dramatic : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units fall out of the rent for rent , and these particularly cheap apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view is far too little : 80@@ ,000 social housing units would have to be built every year , and the federal government would have to invest a grant of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates of the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ ust@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ ust@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of labour for refugees for recognition of labour .
while there was previously a prohibition of work for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation that asylum seekers have confined to a place of residence .
in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the public has majority in view that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly .
lack of German knowledge is a big barrier to access to the labour market .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and vocational language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts .
according to Thr@@ ust@@ hardt , the structure of networks is the Royal Road to the integration of labour .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , speaker for youth and family in Berlin &apos;s Senate administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ pieces in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increased greatly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries students are prepared for lessons without knowledge of German in the welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ags from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state prohi@@ bits asylum seekers or tolerated studying - the only exception to date was Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admission to the university could be made easier for students willing to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or debt do not receive benefits according to the asylum application law more if they start their studies .
the latter usually do not get a b@@ af@@ e because they do not fall under the circle of the deaf persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this financing gap must also be closed , call for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively move the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
the establishment of an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally , would also be important .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on a clear point of contact and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to proceed against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to au@@ gment such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the majority society will have to change , reducing discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination site since a short decade and a General Gender E@@ quality Act .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for everyone : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and why international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention of Germany commit must become reality in the next few years , if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously anticipated refugees , says physician Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requires to hand all of the newcom@@ ers immediately to the registration of health cards .
provided services could be calculated later with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to fores@@ ee so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seekers &quot; law prescri@@ bes .
apart from that , doctors are mainly making language barriers .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more poorly informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in hospitals , even in medical practices , interpretation costs have to be taken over , it calls for them .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV education .
with the partially different symptoms German doctors come from their training , but it is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctors &quot; don@@ or , it may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed education system , some refugees were even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therapist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer , among other things , the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart ra@@ mps and death fears .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment may be necessary , &quot; Mun@@ z explained .
until now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can provide an application for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices usually cler@@ k or doctors , who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst takes into account the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract any age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal leader and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto stands the current man@@ e presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst Family .
thus , the gift to the enthusiasts lies in the blood@@ stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to bring people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to keep up with it .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words , they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is intended to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst looks fascinating also with a sense of intuition and arti@@ stry .
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake @-@ humans fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
so the first commandment : ensure good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or more 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all our heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst takes place from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the animals are open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe places wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , desc@@ ended the stairs from a podium in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them of accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month , they had supp@@ ressed him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected parliament members that the immunity in parliament ends and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will de@@ grade up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ President and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and expanded portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard in the 19@@ 30s to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage one has called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed that it is only September and where his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain at the European Championship .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that wasn &apos;t well healed .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated threat of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league matches in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and to allow players who need it to take a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to continue by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the club to his first European Capital Triumph with his management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : comedy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now has become more desperate than ever before , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man , aiming to question the culture that hin@@ ders men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a group of spiritually healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication managed through social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in cosy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it , even though they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a telephone pastoral worker explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and suscep@@ tible to suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair also , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be broadcast on Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits to Malm@@ ö .
at his debut in the Champions League , Maria meets on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by on Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria encountered less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their advantage when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things we have to perfect throughout the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team in one of three changes , which last weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First league , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was described as the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed the long corner of the network to Johan Wil@@ and .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off beat to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle @-@ field .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed a long way to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some failures and bad degrees , last but not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who died in less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved much more skill if he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which turned Di Maria into a shot , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an therefore scored its sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö was able to return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result down , before substitute players E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times Champions League winner , two times Champions League champion , two times European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was before the Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says .
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in memory : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted guar@@ ola and I &apos;ve played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has got me with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time was running with X@@ av@@ i in 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the whole distance on the lawn , switched off the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King Cl@@ asses triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she wasn &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it when filling the film and not with the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments by the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about - who will always be the director - how to treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove that is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction could &quot; at the end give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval of Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - it &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 rescu@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter had a nationwide impact and urged the legislature and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against farmers .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record still@@ matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation and , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ers who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and help guide Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
the competition show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the final .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge in full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prize of 1 Million $ .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money .
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great gra@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received lots of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt exactly as if they had exchanged the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ ak over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier they once were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb inside a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to handle over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ es , then once in sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times to the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated in the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the sle@@ d@@ geh@@ ter well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Em@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better off in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight to the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ yard at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ring , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back in the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had torn down a two run from the righ@@ th@@ man Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finish run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a Double Play
after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth indoor ring wall , Wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ handed player stroke S@@ ano on three pitches for his fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited from an even im@@ mobile Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es at the start of the game .
the tig@@ ers achieved three rats in the first two cour@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted by the injury list before the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a spinal cord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush@@ es gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers finished second , achieved a one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a great blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not hit particularly well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning , before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever rec@@ ord@@ ship A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three r@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury to the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z Sh@@ oul@@ der in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the injury list because of a shoulder dis@@ cord , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP is painted by Daniel Mor@@ ris from the injury list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing since the 20th of August because of a distortion in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday

hundreds of refugees to come to Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it was counting on refugees arriving from 450 to 750 .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily lodge there .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
in the last ten days , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse had arrived in Hessen , according to information from the District Church of Gie@@ ßen ( Germany ) , responsible for the initial admission .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sport halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective way@@ far@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , it was said that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing down at our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance to refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again established controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian interior minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , to Hungary no one will be sent back .
Germany too did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so arranged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann proposed a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers intend to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
given the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries more strongly in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Ministers in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , they also complain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who do not have a pencil view cannot stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could be locked with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbor country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from travelling to Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said about the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , eye witnesses reported thousands of other migrants on their way to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus a global ocean s@@ aps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , the moon stag@@ gers slightly on its orbit around the ring @-@ planet .
although this pi@@ voting movement is only small , but still too big for a permanent solid body , it is stated in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for longer that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
thus &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of Saturn &apos;s moon in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least at the south pole there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not cleared .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich must ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investigation carried out an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the age of 27 , the association shared .
R@@ ama was compla@@ ining of pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Munich lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to be four weeks of compulsory break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think about it now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible obligation of an in@@ compatible pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;

contrary to his first fears , he remained without a serious bladder .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them , B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to hearty dishes .
it l@@ essen the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service U@@ PS represents up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for Christmas business in the USA .
the company already started the recruitment of seasonal workers , distributed U@@ PS on Tuesday .
especially drivers are being sought .
last year , U@@ PS extended its workforce by 9@@ 5000 subsidies for the holiday season .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex make arrangements for the Christmas business since last year .
in 2013 delayed deliveries had submitted harsh criticism to the parcel service .
first blow @-@ storm , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland shared on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with a whi@@ rl@@ wind through the fo@@ aming valleys .
after blowing on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front which brings strong rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest trend .
on the side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys on the night of Wednesday .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows until Thursday morning in the bo@@ ons of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the fo@@ eh@@ n can reach up to the adjacent centre and even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n ensures summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the alpine slope .
here , rain starts ra@@ ining until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be calculated in the south of the Alps .
on Thursday morning the air escap@@ es , a cold front with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from West to East rolls over Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind refresh@@ es strongly to stor@@ my , and the temperatures go back significantly .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the weekend it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honored as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was filed by the Working Group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in secret for centuries as a minority .
with the pla@@ za , it becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a deca@@ ying sin ba@@ bel .
according to historians his negative impressions should have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the deport@@ ations .
hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated biblical texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who wrote his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equally important with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt has been working on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective and artistic choice from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these cycles are cycles which dev@@ ote topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ land .
as a result , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current context into today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler of the Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an up@@ bringing with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work out to bring myself again with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ living time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is embos@@ sed today by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being supp@@ ressed .
artists have a different mood and pleasure to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall in &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was presented on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like how he gras@@ ps life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not take care to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , even mysterious subjects for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the original - paper and linen pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway is approaching
plans made , space found , companies commissioned to model Earth Hill for a round course : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track , it was finished again .
there were failures in politics and administration , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
thus hill seclu@@ ded , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will take place in October , the first public orthop@@ edi@@ st Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started with the works of the former indoor swimming pool without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga gives a clear signal on the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy of its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been doing this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing to me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the office next Wednesday and meet the minister of state Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and should help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the crucial turn@@ out must put politics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation has ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign if they will be wearing the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left jer@@ sey instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen @-@ President Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have football Bundes@@ liga , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication game on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large collective work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licenses had launched their own projects in their locations was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B option and the German government , provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the associations have already called for the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach .
report : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the United States , he fell on a glass jar after midnight , which he wore in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , he was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out onto the road - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t is able to pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to get up again when you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a similar photograph and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he thus arrives as little as a spare driver for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button during the after@@ math of the weekend in Singapore , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : Bv@@ B without re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der f@@ eller in the gate
with Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes pinn@@ ed on a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the soccer league in the du@@ el with the G@@ FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach released : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel will not only change its trunk position on the re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change in the position of the keeper .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of parent company Roman Ci@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether wil@@ low @-@ f@@ eller will be used in all Europe League matches in the future , however , he left Tu@@ chel open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ceful statement by fellow player Re@@ us that the final draft for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , middle field player Julian Wei@@ gl considers understandable : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the house of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and networked driving will increase road safety and provide for less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together with representatives of industry at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport also emphasizes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and quick transition to digital radio .
a test track at the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed for the testing of new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to enable the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use around the world that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is lifted from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages the human being as a driver .
when driving automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible until 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , road@@ worth@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are expected to be expected far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans still see scep@@ tical cars - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the research organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ously driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent only reck@@ on in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents estimate by 20@@ 25 using autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of digital composite bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , this could mean 15 percent in flowing traffic , in traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at ping p@@ ong @-@ EM
according to the current status of the title fight between September 25 and October 4 , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf is only looking for a single individual .
the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to win the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European semester in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ am@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the se@@ es@@ et@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed and we have become European champi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has injured a serious injury on his right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which a lot of effort was carried out : to advance the d@@ olls , for instance , a sty@@ list was specially hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have bar@@ red about 14 tons of material in Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Gau@@ l &apos;s old ted@@ dy bear can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
later he taught himself how to disc@@ ard fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs from other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
but later I bought them , of course .
for his first show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .

in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in a large quantity for customers , for example , which they worked on for blankets and she@@ ers .
today , this is no longer possible , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion plays a major role in the early stages of the P@@ lau@@ tern peak , and was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past stal@@ ks , is an increasing customer &apos;s potential .
whoever does not use any ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already perform half of all orders .
fashion slots P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ en peaks and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken .
private specialist shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed by chains .
in addition , exports are slu@@ gg@@ ish , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the United States .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer says about the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since that year , we have been leading a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that have to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design will often only be slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow ball point .
at some places , the machine sticks small spheres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could do nothing with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball head for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ dry - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a mem@@ or@@ ative piece .
as a result , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ dry lace .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney dar@@ es to join a new movie of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl .
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny family with the B@@ anks family in times of the global economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , last but not least , &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should use itself to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Board for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new start @-@ ups to promote and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the local reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is tested and tested by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of great importance as it as@@ signs a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legal business environment and makes the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also loose controls over the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed enterprises and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thus increase the consumption of consumers with a significantly higher dose of the ven@@ om .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has received a corresponding working paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full impact to pregnant women and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; are to be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
big pre@@ dat@@ ory fish , however , are already so heavily loaded with mercury that , based on the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be for sale .
in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch called it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans , which is strongly enriched by the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government is therefore warning that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts can cause particularly serious damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly absorbed by the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written request from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations hit more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany by Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and extensively exceeded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings against mercury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
