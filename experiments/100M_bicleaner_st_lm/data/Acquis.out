the organization , community and states bear the costs incurred by each of them in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention .
if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereign power , but extraordinary expenses as a result of a special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs , provided that it has been clari@@ fied in advance .
in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling requested by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and States ensure that third @-@ party liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be applied to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as for the nation@@ als of the States .
any claim to the Community or State vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Community or the State due to damage - except for damages arising from a nuclear incident - arising out of the implementation of the security measures under this Convention shall be governed in accordance with international law .
if the Council concludes after inspection of the relevant information submitted by the Director @-@ General , that the organization has not been in a position to verify that no nuclear material , which must be subject to safety measures under this Convention , must reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Statutes and , if necessary , also take the other measures envis@@ aged there .
in such steps , the Council takes into account the weight gained by the applied security measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary security .
on request of the organization , community or state , consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
any disputes resulting from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be resolved with the exception of disputes which arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which shall not be settled in the way of negotiation or by any other procedure agreed upon by the organization , the Community and the States , at the request of a party to an Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal consisting of five arbit@@ rators .
the community and the states name two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two arbit@@ rators , and the four designated refer@@ ees elect a fifth , who leads the chair@@ manship .
if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ator within thirty days after the request for arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbit@@ rators .
the same procedure shall apply if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days of the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this Agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention shall be to determine the procedures to be applied as necessary in the implementation of the provisions of part I on security measures .
the objective of the methods of securing measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of significant amounts of nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a junction by the risk of early detection .
in order to enrich the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , f@@ ading with spatial confin@@ ement and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the inspections by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material specified for a given time period under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen is specified for each material balance zone .
in carrying out their inspections , the Organization shall make full use of the community &apos;s security system in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials according to this Convention is based on an outline of material balance zones .
in the application of their security measures , the community will make use of de @-@ metho@@ des and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more determined and expe@@ dient in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system for the detection of quantities of preserved , rendered , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and stock quantities ;
B ) ass@@ essing the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and ass@@ essing the uncertainty of the measurement ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) method to evaluate accumulation of measured continu@@ ances and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that identifies the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and arrangements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) has not yet been established , is introduced into the States , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) relies on core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is this core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle introduced into the states , so it is subject to the other coll@@ ateral measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The coll@@ ateral provided in this Convention shall be terminated for the core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions stipulated in Article 11 are not met , the Community is of the opinion that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to safegu@@ ards according to this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable , so the organisation and community consult each other on the application of suitable security measures .
B ) The coll@@ ateral provided in this Convention shall be terminated for the core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community notice that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in gram or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
( B ) Nu@@ clear material used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the Organization released core material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures pursuant to this Convention , of these safegu@@ ards , provided the total material quantity liber@@ ated by this Article in the States is at no time more than
a ) a total of one kilogram of special folding material which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment that lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and about the natural ur@@ an@@ ium is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if freed core material is to be processed or stored along with nuclear material , which is subject to the security measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions for re@@ use of the securing measures are made on that material .
the Community meets with the Organization Suppl@@ ementary Agre@@ ements , which in the extent necessary for the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the Organization in accordance with this Convention , in particular determine how to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without amend@@ ment to this Convention in agreement between the Organization and the Community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the States undertake every effort to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the loss between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organisation establishes a summar@@ ised inventory of the entire core material underlying this Convention in the States , not@@ withstanding its origin , and carries out this inventory list on the basis of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States of Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand .
according to GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EW@@ G decided to contribute to the Special Action Programme laid down at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imped@@ ed by general resource @-@ transfer problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the Central bin@@ dings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table from which it is apparent how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
&quot; &quot; &quot; the organisation establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special Rep@@ osit@@ ory Account &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which consists of the funds which the member states contribute to the special interaction account ; this account is managed by the organization as administrator loyal and used ( in this property , the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the special interaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the fees shall be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive notes issued by the member state which , upon request , to pay in the currency of the respective state to the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first amounting to at least 45 v . h . within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement , or to another between the EE@@ A and the car@@ et@@ aker at the agreed date ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time , agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State can make payments to the above mentioned dates upon request .
according to the usual procedure of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker accepts approximately proportional conc@@ essions to the cash or the school j@@ peg in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and compensate for the special interaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the event of granting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without discount ; and
VII ) the scope in which the problems of the respective countries are regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly expanding development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices applied to the fund financed by the organization &apos;s ordinary funds , which is to be considered by the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of the regular means of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization approved in the context of a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the day of entry into force .
apart from section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions which apply to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years in ten free years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of these containers are to be made directly to the organization that retains them .
any loan contract is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is stated .
revenues from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are established or rendered ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and who , in accordance with what the administrator has set at the time of loan guarantee , may be recipients of a special transaction loan .
the capital re@@ payments made by a special transaction loan are made on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State as soon as possible .
the Administrator informs the EEC on the purposes and programs approved by the directors until the full allocation of all special transactions is carried out by the directors in preparation and on the purposes and programs approved by the directors .
during the period of dis@@ bur@@ sement of the special transaction loan , the Administrator informs the EEC four times a year on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses incurred for this purpose .
the administrator transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after the completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement by the external audi@@ tor of the organization for this account closure .
after a full payout of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EW@@ G reports as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the Special Rep@@ osit@@ ory Account .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs suitable records and accounts from which the contributions to the special interaction account , the amounts to be financed from the account recei@@ pts , the amounts paid to the account and the deposits paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until the complete issue of the funds of the special interaction account , leads from time to time an exchange of ideas about the state of the special interaction account , the progress of programs or projects financed by special interaction agencies and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the EEC and the Organisation may not enter into force , the agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately .
if the total capital amount of all claims made by the bene@@ fici@@ aries in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement has been rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EE@@ A according to the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fies the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities concerning the termination of the procedures concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the lawful authorisation of this agreement by the EEC to the organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the Noti@@ fications mentioned in the organization .
this agreement is written in two in@@ scrip@@ tions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian , and Dutch , and each wording is equally author@@ it@@ ative .
whereas the agreement in the form of an exchange for the amend@@ ment to the Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - HA@@ T issue :

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on Mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands in the context of medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when the banks issue an appropriate application .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor land to the Mechan@@ ism Mechan@@ ism , within a total amount of € 2.@@ 7@@ 25 Bil@@ lion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future investment funds of the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below for which the BI@@ S would be ready to use .
in each stand @-@ by loan , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without the fact that a total of five years are exceeded .
in the opening of the loans as well as in the extension of any extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , it is agreed that the first draw will not be made before the exp@@ iry of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments of its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time considering the Bank &apos;s funds to negotiate , probably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those , which the BI@@ S had applied at the time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum which corresponds to the corresponding margin of the Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you informed me of the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when the banks make a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would tell me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb .
I honor me to take reference to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations concerning the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , both parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled fen@@ nel , lamb and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export options for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and go@@ at@@ meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to guarantee imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina under@@ takes to ensure that the actual annual amount does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to conventional supply forms ( frozen or chill@@ ed ) .
if a change in the offer form is possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the Committee referred to under # 10 in order to find an adequate solution .
in the event that the community claims the clause of protection , it comm@@ its itself to bear in mind that the access to Argentina which is regulated in this agreement is not affected by it in the community market .
in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned .
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products recorded by this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .

the Community is taking everything in order to avoid market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the communal market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community applies measures to prevent the sale of frozen meat from frozen meat as a result of the implementation of the regulation , not under@@ mining the sales of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community accepts that any actual application of ref@@ unds or other promotion measures for the export of lambs and lamb as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lambs are only given at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products .
these terms shall be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ( c ) of the Convention concerning the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement .
Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement in particular by the fact that there are amounts of export lic@@ ences for the products listed under the number 1 within the quantities stated in this agreement .
the Community also under@@ takes to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the presentation of an export license which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .

the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat will be carried out under the agreement under the agreement .
the Committee disc@@ usses all questions arising in the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified at number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount that comes from the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year is fixed in relation to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal nature of trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes made comprehensible to them .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform your government about this .

if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) here@@ tical properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by constantly di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated excluding the volume of the blood cell floo@@ ding in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents which are to be used on object carriers , activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ aging and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and standards for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are currently being elabor@@ ated .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter shows the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series in which a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ vitamin ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent compared to the International standard preparation or a state body of standards in international units ( see Bulletin of WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .

the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the shelf @-@ life tests ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , namely in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no humidity can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying on phosph@@ or@@ us @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of not more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .

the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer laboratory has written records of all stages of production and control of re@@ agents to determine blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all the re@@ agents issued have to be preserved from the laboratory until a certain probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective annex@@ ation .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
