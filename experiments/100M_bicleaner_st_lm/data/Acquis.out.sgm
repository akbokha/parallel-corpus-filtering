<seg id="696">The objective of the methods of securing measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of significant amounts of nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosives for unknown purposes as well as deterrence from such a junction by the risk of early detection.</seg>
<seg id="697">In order to enrich the target specified in Article 28, the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, fading with spatial confinement and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical conclusion of the inspections by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material specified for a given time period under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified megen is specified for each material balance zone.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their inspections, the Organization shall make full use of the community's security system in accordance with Article 3.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Materials according to this Convention is based on an outline of material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of their security measures, the community will make use of de-methodes and measures of the following kind and, as far as necessary, foresee how they are more determined and expedient in the supplementary agreements:</seg>

<seg id="724">If freed core material is to be processed or stored along with nuclear material, which is subject to the security measures under this Convention, precautions for reuse of the securing measures are made on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The Community meets with the Organization Supplementary Agreements, which in the extent necessary for the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the Organization in accordance with this Convention, in particular determine how to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without amendment to this Convention in agreement between the Organization and the Community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the organization, the community and the States undertake every effort to allow these agreements to enter into force within ninety days of the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the loss between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62, the organisation establishes a summarised inventory of the entire core material underlying this Convention in the States, notwithstanding its origin, and carries out this inventory list on the basis of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States of Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (Member States) and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="730">According to GRÜNDE - a) The EWG decided to contribute to the Special Action Programme laid down at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by general resource-transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the Central bindings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table from which it is apparent how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">"" "the organisation establishes a special account under the name" "" "Special Repository Account" "" "which consists of the funds which the member states contribute to the special interaction account; this account is managed by the organization as administrator loyal and used (in this property, the organization is referred to as" "" "steward" "" "), only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement." ""</seg>
<seg id="735">The special interaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The fees shall be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or unobtrusive notes issued by the member state which, upon request, to pay in the currency of the respective state to the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment is made in two instalments (i) the first amounting to at least 45 v. h. within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement, or to another between the EEA and the caretaker at the agreed date;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time, agreed between the EEC and the caretaker, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State can make payments to the above mentioned dates upon request.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedure of the organization, the caretaker accepts approximately proportional concessions to the cash or the school jpeg in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and compensate for the special interaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the event of granting these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the scope in which the problems of the respective countries are regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly expanding development program or project (including a sectoral project), regardless of whether it is part of the organization's loan programme or not, according to the procedures and practices applied to the fund financed by the organization's ordinary funds, which is to be considered by the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of the regular means of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the organization approved in the context of a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the day of entry into force.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from section 4, special transactions are subject to the same repayment conditions which apply to the development loans granted by the organization; they are therefore refundable in 50 years in ten free years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for the payment of these containers are to be made directly to the organization that retains them.</seg>
<seg id="750">Any loan contract is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in particular the origin of the funds is stated.</seg>
<seg id="751">Revenues from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are established or rendered (i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and who, in accordance with what the administrator has set at the time of loan guarantee, may be recipients of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">The capital repayments made by a special transaction loan are made on the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the caretaker to the Member State as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">The Administrator informs the EEC on the purposes and programs approved by the directors until the full allocation of all special transactions is carried out by the directors in preparation and on the purposes and programs approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of disbursement of the special transaction loan, the Administrator informs the EEC four times a year on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses incurred for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transmits the EEC as soon as possible after the completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement by the external auditor of the organization for this account closure.</seg>
<seg id="756">After a full payout of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EWG reports as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the Special Repository Account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The caretaker creates and performs suitable records and accounts from which the contributions to the special interaction account, the amounts to be financed from the account receipts, the amounts paid to the account and the deposits paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator until the complete issue of the funds of the special interaction account, leads from time to time an exchange of ideas about the state of the special interaction account, the progress of programs or projects financed by special interaction agencies and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date, the EEC and the Organisation may not enter into force, the agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately.</seg>
