this document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations on the use of the drug .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ ling thoughts and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal spirits ) alternating with periods of normal sen@@ timent .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral ing@@ es@@ tion of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for intake or melting tablets in patients who are experiencing difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of abili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between neur@@ ons .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is probably mainly known as &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter , works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the brain activity , reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing re@@ occurrence .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms was studied in three studies for up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting from increased anxiety over a period of two hours compared to a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent re@@ occurrence in 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with abili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased un@@ rest , compared with the Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to intake .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than those receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
abili@@ fy prevented the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks , and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similar to Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( in@@ contro@@ led sugar ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ us ( elevated s@@ ali@@ vation ) , drow@@ sin@@ us ( elevated s@@ ali@@ vation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and with which the man@@ ic episodes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , out@@ weigh the risks .
furthermore , the Committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval for the establishment of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union to the company Ot@@ ten@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after change of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide with patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including delicate and mal@@ ig@@ ular form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be de@@ activated .
therefore , caution should be taken with caution in patients with var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
there were , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psycho@@ tic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ ic , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is regarded as clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be undertaken .
with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; met@@ abo@@ ards , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism .
considering the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be undertaken .
after inser@@ ting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be attributed with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ scopic morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Var@@ color@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ mati@@ cally orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
this medicine may not be used during pregnancy because of the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the concerns that arise in the reproduction studies of the animal , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as in other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned to use dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined in accordance with the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , a total decreased incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Parkinson &apos;s , th@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ ran@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in plac@@ ebo patients .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with lanz@@ aph@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ ran@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those suffering from lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients .
a comparison between the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo group of patients with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ or@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ru@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , undesi@@ rable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone has been observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
there is no information about the efficacy of a ha@@ em@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ em@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma eradic@@ ation .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a parti@@ all@@ ag@@ onal effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 1- and D3 @-@ receptor and to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ receptor as well as a medi@@ oc@@ re aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to the alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ gen and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in dosage of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for healthy subjects , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ t .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the respon@@ der &apos;s response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an ol@@ factory @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study for schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase in weight of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5 ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in week 3 versus plac@@ ebo , comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable share of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion diagnostic with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found herself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ fall , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ las@@ ing of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation Time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ related effects .
a population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in patients with various liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impact of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional safety psychology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , thus only limited or no significance for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) at the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile duc@@ al of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or between 16@@ - and 8@@ 1@@ ples of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for more than 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to 3 and 11 times the average steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a parti@@ all@@ ag@@ onal effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recept@@ ors .

clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle observed and could lead to serious complications .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a parti@@ all@@ ag@@ onal effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recept@@ ors .
in an ol@@ factory @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study for schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase in weight of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5 ) .
97 in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy vis @-@ à @-@ vis plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as a solution to the intake of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

abili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in order to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended in circum@@ vention of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ tra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see Section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including delicate and mal@@ ig@@ ular form ) .

clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ ic , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia based on com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle observed and could lead to serious complications .

105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , decreases the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is regarded as clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; met@@ abo@@ ards , the common application of highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be undertaken .

the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined in accordance with the following criteria : commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in plac@@ ebo patients .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those suffering from lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ ran@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo treated patients .
a comparison between the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo group of patients with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ru@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , undesi@@ rable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of det@@ achment / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the moderate improvement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score for the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gra@@ vation , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined by a reduced number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the respon@@ der &apos;s response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ gli@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study for schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , more than 7 % increase in weight compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of approx . 5 ) .
111 in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion diagnostic with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks , followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found herself superior to plac@@ ebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ fall , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tra @-@ muscular layer .
studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous administration did not concern safety @-@ related concerns based on mat@@ ernal exposure , which lay in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( or@@ ally ) for safety psychology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; thus , they have only limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) at the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sing@@ ular application or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce adverse events ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
only those who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer were seen in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival , no difference between the medicines .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before or before treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing drugs , drugs should not be given to other medicines in order to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ats &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dosage should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 , treatment is interrupted until improvement is achieved in degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there are no studies with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data to recommend dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have considerably other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in the patients no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils decrease again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac in@@ cursions are not unusual in the indicated patient &apos;s collective , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients with the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ corro@@ sive and con@@ sti@@ lling methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women of child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women of child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a spar@@ row preservation prior to the treatment because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible bar@@ r@@ enness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect the traffic ti@@ ghtness and ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most remarkable hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows adverse events associated with the dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , blo@@ ating , tongue burning , dry mouth , tooth@@ paste , loose stools , o@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , lower abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding diseases of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , dy@@ no , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain , muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The incidence of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a specific case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the amal@@ gam@@ ation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ a and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ u@@ bul@@ ous network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ lu@@ c@@ tose of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ receptor and because of the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the tumor area .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm , un@@ linked studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III study .
in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was administered in the form of an in@@ fusion of about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer for over 30 minutes .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy first , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metastatic disease and 19 % due to metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving First @-@ Line therapy are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in relation to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural progression of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay to bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 minutes in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials .
exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft tissue attachment of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration the Clear@@ ance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ be and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ination of the un@@ modified agent was 4 % of the total dose of 6@@ α hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light for more than 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as in other potentially toxic substances , caution should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion fluid has to be inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute to a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion fluid .
after full addition of the solution , the water bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid material .
then the hat@@ ch should be sw@@ ung slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete suspension of the powder is carried out .
if precip@@ itations or sin@@ king materials are visible , the water bottle must be inver@@ ted gently again in order to achieve a complete residual suspension before applying .
the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated for the patient and the corresponding amount of the re@@ constitu@@ ed Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

member states must ensure that the holder of the marketing authorization for the market launch provides medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging contributions . • With a clear graphical representation of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transporting by the patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a bi@@ ologic drug already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood cancers , in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ di@@ amed has to be started under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses that the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ di@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be done by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the course of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a primary study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected with E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before being either switched to either Ab@@ se@@ amed or to continue receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values between the start of the study and the assessment period between the weeks 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of di@@ mm@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were switched to ab@@ u@@ amed were uph@@ eld in the same degree as for those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ di@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ di@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
amed amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the drug has been proven to be a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , according to the European Union regulations .
the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce medicines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a approval for the distribution of di@@ amed amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tum@@ ors , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( for example cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the start of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger operative interventions which require a large amount of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , ab@@ u@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml will be applied which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the physician must evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of disease .
an increase in ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values over or below the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration can occasionally be observed in a patient .
given this ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of an@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than those in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than those in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by means of intraven@@ ous administration , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the physician must evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of disease .
given this ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for controlling the an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ y@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l have increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value has increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ y@@ cy@@ te number to ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , an response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood count is required , in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight should be received twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or programme - to make large iron reserves available before the start of the ab@@ u@@ amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( Day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ operative 300 I.@@ U. / kg every 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately thereafter .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into the circulation .
patients diagnosed with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive either Ab@@ di@@ amed or any other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month prior to the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic por@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
for patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who are not able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , es@@ cor@@ t or atro@@ phy diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease of the oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as a reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 @-@ 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of a non @-@ contact ( iron , fol@@ ate acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ or@@ o@@ toxic@@ ity , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ y@@ tic value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes index ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers are normal , and if no other reason for a loss of action is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibodies should be determined and a study of the bone mar@@ row should be considered as a diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ di@@ amed in patients with a risk for antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical trials , an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events was observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ x @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the use of epo@@ et@@ ins when the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of an@@ e@@ dem@@ y@@ mpt@@ oms and avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increasing hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
tumor patients under chemotherapy should consider epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of holding the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision on the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing under the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial an@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl there is an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic / vascular events .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not shown that tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia can improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy were returned if ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
when epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be checked and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dosage should be adjusted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ cts , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , retin@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys have been reported in patients suffering from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most frequent side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ tic events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - general ) was observed in patients treated with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
independent of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the genetic epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ itus and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells it could be shown that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese .

survival and progression were studied in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and the control patient .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin showed consistent an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality as with controls based on various frequent malign@@ omas .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the examined data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous administration showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels obtained after intraven@@ ous injection .
no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are given 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of ha@@ em@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ) .
14 in animal experimental studies with approximately 20 times the weekly dose recommended for humans epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to decreased federal body weight , to dec@@ eler@@ ate the os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in the fet@@ al mortality rate .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • in the event of receiving new information , which could have an impact on current safety specifications ( safety specification ) , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures • within 60 days of achieving an important milestone ( pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) • E@@ MEA
• if you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within one month prior to your treatment • if you suffer from inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , the risk of blood cl@@ ots in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) exists - for example , if such a blood pot@@ ency has occurred in the past .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral vascular disease ) , cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) suffered recently a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can result in a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ e@@ ets within the normal range , which again rep@@ lic@@ ates after further treatment .
your doctor may perform peri@@ odic blood tests if necessary to control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets periodic@@ ally during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ u@@ amed prior to treatment .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a after mon@@ th@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( inj@@ ected ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
if you are suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia , it will break your treatment with Ab@@ di@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia will be treated best .
therefore , Ab@@ di@@ amed must be given by inj@@ ecting into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
high ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or increasing levels of potassium , your doctor may take an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ di@@ amed until the potassium levels fall back to normal .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of the an@@ a@@ emia associated with ab@@ u@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet liable to di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your blood glucose levels ( ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your stri@@ de amed dose to minim@@ ise the risk of blood bo@@ unc@@ ing ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic event ) .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully towards the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events have already occurred in the past ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are a cancer patient , keep in mind that stre@@ amed amed can have a negative effect on blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumour .
if you have a greater orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the start of the treatment .
if your values of the red blood pigment ( ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ di@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or used it recently , even if it is a non @-@ prescription drug .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ di@@ amed , your doctor may possibly arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or with HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia ( an@@ a@@ emia ) refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you get regular doses of Ab@@ s@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed over two equally large inj@@ ections .

ac@@ la@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as in the case of inf@@ estation ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ up@@ a may be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to assess ac@@ la@@ a .
in the first study nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included two 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was studied .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ up@@ a was tested in two trials in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with a ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under acet@@ last@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to those in plac@@ ebo .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % in comparison to all patients under acet@@ plac@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ up@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ up@@ a occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
ac@@ last@@ a may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ om@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with ac@@ last@@ a are exposed to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ cord producer provides information material for doctors prescri@@ bing acet@@ last@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited approval for the placing on the transport of Ac@@ cords within the entire European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of acet@@ ylene is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ up@@ a should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol can be reduced by using acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger .
children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on safety and efficacy are missing .
patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) are not recommended because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia must be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the beginning of therapy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of cit@@ ric acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ ts@@ mia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first ten days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be given a dental examination with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
for patients who require dental interventions , no data are available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen following the application of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as serious side effects was increased in patients who received Ac@@ last@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , random ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function Dis@@ order Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function disorders which , as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases of acute ren@@ al failure .
changes in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance ( measured annually prior to ad@@ minist@@ ering ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as impaired kidney function were similar in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ up@@ a versus 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels below the normal range of fluctu@@ ation ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in patients with the disease Pa@@ get .
all patients received suppl@@ em@@ ental amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ ture and in the disease Pa@@ get trials ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently l@@ itt@@ led hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of acet@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ om@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ och@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis in the jaw area was occasionally treated , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( primarily in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates including cit@@ ric acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area in patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a and in a plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patient .
in case of an over@@ dose leading to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ c@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by the administration of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been demonstrated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Score for scar@@ ves ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on the body frac@@ tures of Ac@@ up@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years and the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduction in the risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on acet@@ ate frac@@ tures showed an equally lasting effect over three years resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) ac@@ last@@ a increased bone density on the lum@@ bar spine , hips and dist@@ al radius significantly compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the lum@@ bar density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the th@@ igh bone decreased by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology for 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the pel@@ vic bone .
in contrast to plac@@ ebo , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture compared to plac@@ ebo .
bone sales marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ posi@@ ti@@ d of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ last@@ a reduced 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was kept at 28 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
the B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before the in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , compared to plac@@ ebo treatment , the BM@@ D increased the overall height of the BM@@ D at all points of time .
compared to plac@@ ebo treatment , the treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total joints and 4.3 % at the lower neck .
clinical effectiveness in males In H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ up@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once yearly administration of acet@@ last@@ a compared to the once weekly dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months versus the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was investigated in patients and patients over the age of 30 using radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly mild to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2.6 times up to 3.@@ 0@@ ples of age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months has been demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparison studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months versus the bas@@ eline for acet@@ last@@ a and ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month trial ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with acet@@ last@@ a and 107 patients with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ as , who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with acet@@ last@@ a could be maintained in an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg refle@@ x@@ ic acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after this , the plasma cruci@@ ble rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination period with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation Time of ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presum@@ ably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the area below the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a reduced clear@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely because cy@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ om@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 patients examined .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance up to 35 ml / min requires no dose adjustment of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron juice .
as for severe kidney function problems ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ Latvian single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and in rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight .
for studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C ( 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous use was given the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in rats , adding 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( an cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulated expos@@ ures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects of other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the I.@@ V. injection site occurred .
the most common finding in trials with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hysi@@ cal met@@ ap@@ hysi@@ cs of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats , a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity of doses above 0.2 mg / kg was observed as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was expressed at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum levels of serum .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ ro@@ gens that are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is built in an un@@ organized way , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
ac@@ last@@ a works by norm@@ alizing bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus strengthening bones .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ last@@ a .
in the case of using Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are using / applying / applying other medicines , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs known to harm the kidneys .
when applying ac@@ la@@ a along with food and drinks , be sure to take sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a according to your doctor &apos;s instructions .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of acet@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ last@@ a is effective for a long time , you may need to take another dose after a year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your time after the in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ cord is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before ending the therapy with Ac@@ last@@ a If you are considering the termination of treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects related to the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a .
currently , it is unclear whether Ac@@ up@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms with you after you have received Ac@@ last@@ a .

if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are advised to perform the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of acet@@ ylene , the patients need to be adequately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of cit@@ ric acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atically exp@@ iring , hypo@@ kal@@ ts@@ mia can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , in accordance with at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of acet@@ ylene .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a .

in addition , four studies have been conducted to more than 7@@ ,000 patients , in which levels of ab@@ norm@@ a have been used as a suppor@@ tive drug to adjust smoking compared to a plac@@ ebo .
on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking have shown no consistent results , so that the effect of levels of levels in this field of application was difficult to assess .
the most common side effects of rheumato@@ id arthritis ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory infections ( nausea ) and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .

also in patients who - in addition to obesity - have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other related persons must be advised that it is necessary to monitor the new@@ born of such symptoms and immediately obtain medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• The efficacy and safety of ri@@ pp@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not sufficiently demonstrated .

Sum@@ mary of the EP@@ AR for the general public The present document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations on the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ inal medication ) is not indicated .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in alone can not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted in the highest tolerated dose alone .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ inous or insulin , the previous dosage of the Sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ inous or insulin can be maintained with the commen@@ cement of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea and insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , enabling type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of acet@@ one was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapies ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ inous , in addition they received either acet@@ one or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
this led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels have been lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy trial , the effect of adding an additional dose of acet@@ one to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study where the combination of ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took acet@@ one in addition to insulin showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were blur@@ red vision , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thal@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
it may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that acet@@ one should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients within the framework of a single use . met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited authorisation to transport Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
in this study , there was an increase in the reports of heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased outcome ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T @-@ mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes must be checked .
the decision whether treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be pres@@ ided over to the clinical evaluation of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases related to fluid retention .
as a result of a h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , a minor reduction of the mean ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred in the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ators with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea or as two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported in the treatment with di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report on disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological investigation should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ tas@@ k@@ inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by three times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % decrease in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreased and thereby less@@ ening the availability of the metabolic substrates for red@@ dish growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not inv@@ alu@@ able from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents more than three times the upper limit of the normal range often occurred as in plac@@ ebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
since the market launch rarely has been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events in bone frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies was carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in groups treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active trial running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral gly@@ cos@@ iness in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide , as mon@@ otherapy , was continued over two years to study the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin despite a three @-@ month improvement phase were random@@ ised to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the treated group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical studies over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents proved to be statisti@@ cally significant in comparison to initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week examination of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , a reduction in overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids as well as an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced total plas@@ mat@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide , and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one while values decreased under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ sia .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active trial , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral appliance pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma are normally achieved 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy corresponds roughly to the thre@@ ef@@ old of the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies it was proven that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after or@@ ally application of a radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was mainly found in the rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elimination period of unchanged pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite is between 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral @-@ clearance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric hyper@@ tro@@ phy occurred .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting in the gest@@ ation decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of famili@@ al aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ inde@@ xes led to increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide were investigated .
in clinical studies over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents proved to be statisti@@ cally significant in comparison to initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both on the effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ ent@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ alities , non @-@ mortal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are not associated with taking pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was diagnosed in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror indicating that blood sugar levels were lowered similarly to another human@@ oid .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package content ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glucose level has improved dramatically , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can detect hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding thickness , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human@@ oid or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin of animal origin ) can lead to a change in dosage required .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the physician must consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients to always ask for other drugs taken by them .
4 . both hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .

however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ics can be treated by oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ics with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1,0 mg ) or by glucose given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in@@ human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to carry out ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id transport throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of quickly acting insulin must be absorbed , then the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the administration site - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions during the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ ab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic patients who underwent major surgical procedures showed that a 42 % reduction in mortality ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total active duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was examined at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ ab@@ etic children ( aged 6 to 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

aden@@ o@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of de@@ position of crystals , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation of the joints ) or rheum@@ atism ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine crystals that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months there are still toxic@@ ity to occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients with Aden@@ ur@@ ic have to take more medicines to prevent g@@ ou@@ ging at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ o@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( plac@@ ebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 out of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who received an aden@@ o@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily intake 120 mg per day had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients in plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , in reducing the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood , Aden@@ o@@ ic was more effective in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including a known or currently known toxic@@ ity node and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 - 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken into consideration daily .
in patients with severe ren@@ al impair@@ ment , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of fo@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t receivers , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other res@@ inous drugs , acute g@@ out occurs during the beginning of the treatment because of the reduction in serum ur@@ ic acid levels , ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue can initially be mobili@@ sed .
B. for malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment ( Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases will rise so far that it will result in a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with bas@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before commen@@ cement of the bas@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment and follow the clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ ine was not performed any interaction studies to F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of fo@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study with test subjects 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC@@ 1 x daily measured an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ing effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It was shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de slow@@ ed the absorption of bas@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies can not be attributed to side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at during pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not imp@@ ly direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall study group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be observed .
the risk factors identified by these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
common side effects ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , random ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , which could stand in the treatment groups with a total of 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and reported in all bas@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once were listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical studies no severe skin ras@@ hes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies in the open long @-@ term extension studies were treated with 9@@ 06 patients for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .

the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and is produced in the context of the reaction as@@ k@@ ade of hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was demonstrated in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients receiving the last three monthly peri@@ odi@@ cal acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study demonstrated the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ VE 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg daily .

the lowering of the serum for the serum to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during a visit to the doctor in week 2 and was maintained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ atine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage return of serum fer@@ ric acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function problems ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum fer@@ ric acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum fer@@ ric acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
data from the open extension study in phase 3 shown in two years showed that the permanent lowering of serum ur@@ ic acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a gyp@@ sum ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ ums , which resulted in a total dis@@ appearance of the g@@ ums up to 24 % in 54 % of patients .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with bas@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at were dos@@ ed proportion@@ ately after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional ascent .
after ing@@ es@@ tion of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2@@ µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decline of serum and acid concentration as long as this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range obtained with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dosage of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine , about 45 % of the dose was found in the stool as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency following the intake of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean overall AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at was about 1.8 times more than 7.5 μ@@ g of the h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ ( h / ml ) in the group with severe ni@@ hili@@ sm function .
12 Li@@ ver function after ing@@ es@@ tion of multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( chil@@ ds @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication B ) Li@@ ver function restricted the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specialized pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that bas@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred in high doses that were around 4 @-@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a delay in development in the offspring of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data origin@@ ating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also provided data that shows that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dosage included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , inflammatory abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic re@@ but@@ tal .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any other component , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it may not be used for es@@ oph@@ agus diseases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed after standing up the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or cr@@ ush the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie down before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ la@@ sty should be given only with particular caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be informed in the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ um pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be elevated in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to take any symptoms that indicate an ast@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .

oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapists included predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there is no data available to indicate whether the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw is reduced in patients who require a jaw @-@ surgical procedure .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet the next morning when the dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is missed after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned for that day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE prior to therapy .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical trials jointly with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , fet@@ al / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the climb@@ s of the BM@@ D from the spine and trou@@ gh continued to stop ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
it consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new ed@@ ging frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
following an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered adult patients to which a kidney or liver has been graf@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ through the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already in use in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereas the application of Adv@@ oc@@ ard with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after one year of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplantation or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter follow @-@ up studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how inc@@ ision is absorbed by the body in comparison with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or any of the other components , advoc@@ acy must not be used .
patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs are used simultaneously with adv@@ ant , as the dosage or the dose of the medicine taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and transplantation of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood reflection provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; )
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to advance , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley mirrors should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a Tal@@ king , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
meticul@@ ous and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus seb@@ um are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ enti@@ f in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure during immediate transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the law can take several days until steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative phase does not allow oral ing@@ es@@ tion of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion fluid ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application For the suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral advance therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dosage in the morning .
further dose adjustments may later be necessary as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dosage in the morning .
dosage recommendation - Adju@@ st@@ ment of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules should be switched to once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose , is to take place .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs to adv@@ ant once a day , the treatment must begin with the recommended oral initial dose for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of corneal gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplantation In adult patients who are switched to advance , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ oc@@ ate in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ted patients , was administered in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining blood levels in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function ex@@ erts no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cre@@ atine index , a calculation of the in@@ oc@@ in@@ ine in@@ oc@@ ation and a monitoring of the ur@@ inal volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f In case of switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the Tal@@ king level in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases by means of full blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ king controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus seb@@ um during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ king of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after transi@@ tioning from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ ant , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since advoc@@ acy is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred .
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ king of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood is usually in the range of 5 @-@ 20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t receivers , blood concentrations in the range between 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded wording in advance .
no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded wording adv@@ ant are still available for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies should be avoided during a treatment with adv@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels is offered in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ enti@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infection , fluid over@@ loading and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ig@@ ning skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturbances , should have a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption , special caution is recommended .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and , consequently , increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood serum with simultaneous administration of substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage to maintain even concentrations according to the current conditions ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with anti@@ fung@@ al agents such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ li@@ lid antibiotic Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of the gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used for acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus drugs is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the exposure to hormone exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and prolon@@ gs their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a new@@ born hyper@@ alkal@@ ine ( In@@ ci@@ dence 8 of 111 ) new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the side effects are listed below after their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in conjunction with treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , low water solu@@ bility and high binding to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ole protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular interior .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent blocking of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 l@@ ung@@ lung patients in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t and in 6@@ 30 cases were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases .
overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent , multic@@ entre study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported , who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in in 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in cases treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , 2@@ 1,7 % of cases were found in cases of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were switched from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the occurrence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multic@@ entre study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who simultaneously underwent a treatment of pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then achieved to reach the desired level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ tations showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this causes tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to be completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose .

Adv@@ oc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in people with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting caused by the deficiency of factor VI@@ II ) .
dosage and frequency of use depend on whether advoc@@ ates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced by a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to enable the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ate is a medicine approved in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently , so that the drug does not contain any protein of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , among them a study with 53 children under six , the drug application was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of Adv@@ oc@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood counts with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ oc@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ oc@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the marketing of Adv@@ oc@@ ates throughout the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II deficiency , the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plas@@ mas@@ ti@@ fication ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat inj@@ ections every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
an appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is advised during the treatment course to control the administered dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the speed of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II targeted Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using a modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ ite known inhibit@@ ors development , switching from re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rarely &lt; 1 / 000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ots factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - level in plasma and the clearance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th of the day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
in addition , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was found in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study formed 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but no signs or symptoms showed any allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has reported over hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a C@@ of@@ ak@@ tor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as a positive , but considered that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal process in 5 years .
December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited granted the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to formally withdraw his application for the marketing of Adv@@ ance in the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues that connect and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically altered in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus can not trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene present in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the lower abdom@@ en area , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered .
based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP generates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proved that Adv@@ ex@@ in injection in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore provides benefits to patients .
the Committee also noted concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that advoc@@ ate can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by allergy to poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet which should be taken with or without food entirely with a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ oned .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all ha@@ y fever symptoms other than con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients who received a@@ a@@ ze reported a 4@@ 6.0 % decrease in symptoms compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , mouth @-@ dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , with adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for allergy treatment ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from hyper@@ tension glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular disease including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( cereb@@ ral hyper@@ tension ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aer@@ op@@ ol throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking them , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms subsi@@ ded .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can continue as a mon@@ otherapy in case of need with des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within the 2 weeks after termination of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , pil@@ erg@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ po@@ amin or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ oline etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient &apos;s collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or head@@ aches ) must be de@@ activated .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be carried out at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
however , in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests , no significant differences could be found between patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n and plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone or alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
in vivo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibited L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
as reproduction studies are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in impaired traffic or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ els .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ kor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , blur@@ red vision , vision disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary freeze and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ess to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily there was no increased incidence of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 to 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s took part , in which 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall results for the symptoms ( besides nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences in terms of age , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the body weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , after the addition of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent , was the exposure of an aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional safety psychology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n do not allow any particular danger to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , and its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tears or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes were reported .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of inflammation of the liver and over cases of con@@ spic@@ uous h@@ ep@@ atic values were also very rarely reported .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup / w .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
effectiveness was measured by determining the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ru@@ ples , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body utilizes the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children are harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( number of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease of the total score after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in the plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing on the market of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should take place according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms have been stopped and resum@@ ed .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the effects of alcohol were not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that there may be he@@ ade@@ dness in very rare cases , which may result in impaired traffic or the ability to operate machinery .
clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported more often than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was head@@ aches , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of the patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were administered .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P sel@@ ect@@ ins to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n was administered daily for more than 14 days .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no longer an extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated on behalf of other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , not@@ withstanding the eti@@ ology , is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited .
since hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ al factor in all age @-@ related diseases , it is expected that in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , besides the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , results in an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of quad@@ ri@@ later@@ als at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the study was excluded from the study by the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced sleep and wak@@ ef@@ ulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient demo@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely ruled out .
in vivo , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ European and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) had no effect on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with the@@ L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of the@@ Ro@@ qu@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional safety and toxic@@ ity studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not allow any particular danger to humans .
coloured film ( contains lac@@ tose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ mine ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m , macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , light wax .
eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data which support the treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical ab@@ norm@@ alities , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ se des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n and experience greater substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children from 2 to 11 years , which is fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose ad@@ sorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the effects of alcohol were not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents who were administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment , received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged 6 to 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children population .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n was used daily for more than 14 days .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased incidence of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was noted .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were not affected by psych@@ om@@ otor impair@@ ment in adults and adolescents in clinical studies .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced power impair@@ ment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets will effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of quad@@ ri@@ later@@ als at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable with adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup form@@ ulations of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are restricted .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max is approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug @-@ cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the di@@ or@@ ac@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Sy@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ ck@@ eting bottles with a children &apos;s safe injection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application sy@@ ringe for preparing with scal@@ ings of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .
take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for inhal@@ ing once a day , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate can be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were used .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n was used for up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n was administered in a dosage of 45 mg a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no longer an extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily there was no increased incidence of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured values of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets daily in mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years has not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us poured a tablet as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for the engaging formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n was administered in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured values of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this badly metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) larger than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , however the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2,5 mg tablets were not examined in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed processed tablets the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

put an A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg tablet once a day to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed tablets proved to be the equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for the engaging formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n was used for up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a 30 single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured values of the flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .

in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical trials for the melting tablet revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical use .
the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between the ages of 2 and 11 , which is fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose ad@@ sorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to that of the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n Group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in infants aged 6 to 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more often than plac@@ ebo reported diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3,@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n , no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years of age .
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased incidence of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was noted .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
as shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets will effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable with adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n , no bio @-@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
different single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with those recommended by adults who received a 5 mg dose of di@@ or@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .

in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. informed the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially , that the company accepts its application for permission to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic outbreak occurs when a new trunk of the flu virus appears that can easily spread from humans to humans because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
when the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign @-@ alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to produce antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this trunk .
subsequently , the membrane gro@@ mm@@ et of the virus was puri@@ fied with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign objects ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study had not been carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this did not extend the scope of the clinical data basis for evaluating the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but it cannot be taken together with k@@ night cavi@@ ar as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
gener@@ ase should only be decre@@ ed if the doctor has checked the an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood is that the virus is addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
in children between the ages of 4 and 12 , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose is based on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the an@@ gener@@ ase , which was enhanced with low doses of low doses , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults , who used earlier prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after the treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml under A@@ gener@@ ase than in plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few responded to the treatment of the children previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults who earlier had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load enhanced with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase combined with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , skin rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients taking St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are broken down as well as an@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as in other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking A@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for the marketing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ best@@ os ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r should be performed taking into account the individual viral disease resistance and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the enhancing additive of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ag@@ gra@@ zing in combination with low doses of k@@ night avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
con@@ current application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction ; in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also medi@@ ums of cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r during intake of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ night cavi@@ ar and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy have increased risk of liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
in the event of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
because the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular Rev@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients taking these drugs at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is insufficient to assess the nature of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ pi@@ ate removal , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 5 in duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other illnesses that were prescribed medicines that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of ill patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ omas are reported .
at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , a higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines , whose active ingredients are mainly metaboli@@ sed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the lowered plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse reactions in the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ ate@@ urs mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s Wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , whereas C@@ max was reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , confirming the efficacy and safety of this treatment regi@@ men .
52 % ab@@ ased when am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r in plasma obtained with the combination of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there has been no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical study on the use of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ one component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is necessary .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower serum concentration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with azi@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin have not been performed but the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2,@@ 69@@ k compared to the value observed after 200 mg ket@@ ac@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may cause interactions when used together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines when used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it may result in res@@ or@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r plasma levels .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , di@@ lem@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and an@@ ap@@ am@@ il .
the simultaneous intake of ap@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study in which rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of ag@@ gra@@ zing with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
for H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels with simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase are expected .
as plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this drug with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used together with Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am taken with or@@ ally ( see Section 4.3 ) while caution is required while using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ i@@ pi@@ ate , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as to how to adapt the am@@ rup@@ a dosage if Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
con@@ current administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended for increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Rev@@ atio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not pre@@ dict@@ ably , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended while gra@@ zing at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may be used only after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , to which am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r was given from the evap@@ oration into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
further development of the seed , including fertility and reproduction , was not affected by the administration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapies .
most of the side effects associated with the treatment of the veins were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely lead to the treatment of the treatment .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicine used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed at more than 1 % of patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ ec@@ al fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation ( spi@@ ke spi@@ ke ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ pre @-@ treated subjects treated with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 presented in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 patients ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .

cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections in HIV @-@ infected patients ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; one exception constituted increases of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures are to be initiated .

the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r vs. HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral and not previously untreated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r used treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described have rarely been observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral , not pre @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of fossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children in which vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ edi@@ avi@@ r / k@@ night avi@@ r or fossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ night avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to fossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a decreased lik@@ el@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always approach the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in connection with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ edi@@ avi@@ r / k@@ night avi@@ r or fossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ night avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies selling diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with reduced sensitivity to am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r @-@ associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 fossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ances , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral , not previously treated patients , in which a fossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r @-@ containing regi@@ men failed ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early termination of a preventive therapy is recommended to prevent the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study Pro@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open trial in which PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ gues ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard of care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) received with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / k@@ night avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy rate of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ checked veins is based on two un@@ controlled trials of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was tested three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) versus the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ checked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; veins should be taken into account when optim@@ ising the therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration the average duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max , by 30 % , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimal concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of absorption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state via the range from C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines which in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 respectively represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if given at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , results in a similar daily intake of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , so the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these regi@@ mens lead to am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained at healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous use of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in male animals with doses of the 2.0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ times ( rat ) of the human exposure , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there were little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and therapeutic applications .
in a standard battery of in vitro and in @-@ vitro gene toxic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al cell tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical use by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of ap@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate both in the control animals and in the animals treated with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly inferior ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ne@@ gation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the enhancing additive of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
con@@ current application should be carried out with caution in patients with low or mild liver dysfunction ; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular Rev@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and metabolic disorders associated with it .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , whereas C@@ max was reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r in plasma obtained with the combination of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data .

in a clinical study in which rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
con@@ current administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase is recommended for increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Rev@@ atio ) because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may be used only after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , to which am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r was given from the evap@@ oration into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapies .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures are to be initiated .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the benefit of &quot; un@@ checked &quot; veins should be taken into account when optim@@ ising therapy in the treatment of PI pre @-@ treated children .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state in the steady state via the range from C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines which in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 respectively represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if given at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in male animals with dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ times ( rat ) of the human exposure after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r .

the bio@@ availability of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for ap@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral treatments up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for det@@ ecting and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
con@@ current administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not reduce the risk 47 of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular Rev@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .

in the case of ill patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ omas are reported .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .

amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , to which am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r was given from the evap@@ oration into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapies .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicine used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .

early termination of a sa@@ vor@@ ing 60 therapy is recommended to prevent the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 . based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ checked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; veins should be taken into account when optim@@ ising therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ rup@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the reported side effects you have considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of A@@ gener@@ ase .
the use of A@@ gener@@ ase will be based on the individual viral disease resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from one of the above conditions or if you are taking any of the drugs mentioned above .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( booster ) , make sure that you read the use information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before beginning the treatment .
there are also no adequate information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the effectiveness of children between 4 to 12 years or generally in patients less than 50 kg body weight .

the frequency of application and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied five times a week for six weeks . • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it can be applied three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment .
the cream is thin before bed@@ time to apply to the affected areas of the skin so that it remains on the skin for a long time ( approximately eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo carried either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ omet@@ ry .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ ato@@ tic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oma ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has to continue until all visible stain@@ s in the genital or peri@@ anal areas have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
interruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely cured , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed to the usual therapy plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the clean@@ sed skin area infected with the war@@ ts until the cream is fully absorbed .
it should be atten@@ u@@ ated between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
this treatment should take place between the benefit of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host response .
in other studies , where no daily in@@ timacy was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a k@@ not leading to circumcision .
in case of an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or caused temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions oc@@ cured at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly after a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied methods for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ anal area has not yet been clinical experience .
although limited data indicate an increased rate of fac@@ tual reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has demonstrated less efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the tendencies .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair approach was not investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions is generally decreasing during therapy or after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment period of several days may be made .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent and previously treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7,@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , in the interior of the nose or in the ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ id .
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of therapy or go back after treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause the patient to cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for several days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 active l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ ating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , fet@@ al / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) have not been quanti@@ fiable after a single top@@ ical application , no recommendation can be made for use during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly shared and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side effects in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the event war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trial were shown below .
the most common adverse effects associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in these studies were a reaction at the site of the application ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects that were given by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
this evaluation of the clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / leaves / scales ( 23 % ) and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) came ( see section 4.4 ) .
this assessment of the clinical signs provided according to the study protocol showed that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often resulted in severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , serious ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sh@@ oring and dis@@ arm@@ ament ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or the surrounding area .
the sing@@ ular oral intake of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , systemic concentrations of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that efficacy with regard to a complete healing of the tendencies in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
at 60 % of all patients who had been treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od , the patients were completely cured ; this was in the case of 20 % of the 105 patients with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od in five @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies was investigated in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and that remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ ato@@ tic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic action l@@ esi@@ ons within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ e@@ ak@@ able scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external genital war@@ ts , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ ficial carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not investigated .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children between 2 and 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be demonstrated in these studies in the dos@@ ages being studied ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or .
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three @-@ week @-@ weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od to the top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial B@@ CC .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly lowered body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months for der@@ mal application did not result in similar effects with the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in three days a week induced no tum@@ ors at the application site .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for humans due to systemic exposure is considered to be very low .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream previously and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the reported side effects you have considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any inci@@ dental adverse effects that occur during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously performed .
to treat the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions 60 minutes before the on@@ set of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ agents ) .
in the event of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should not be used at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the intra@@ ocular up@@ take of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not imp@@ ly direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , fet@@ al / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns which have been exposed to breast milk over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
side effects in clinical trials were mainly prescribed as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
undesi@@ rable drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3 trial and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are performed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions emerged , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial oil ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted Drug Aff@@ ects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe course form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients received a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ical conversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a more severe form of ser@@ os@@ copy at the age of 5 ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until a premature exit from the study ) , no radio@@ immun@@ op@@ recip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say was detected by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ recip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) .
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG sp@@ ying in the urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was determined in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ing effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the treatment of enz@@ ym@@ atic enzymes is a sufficient re@@ establishment of enzyme activity for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients had a mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the anticipated value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary outcomes for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected F@@ V and absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms every week for 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared the plac@@ ebo group to improve lung function and sal@@ vi@@ ability presented in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increases further proportion@@ ately to the body size of growing children .
of 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ Atom@@ ic anom@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous group manifestation between patients treated by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant change across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage @-@ normal Fe@@ V , range in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of movement of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 trial was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ score for this age group . the younger patients with the severe type of course ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe type of progression they were limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ co@@ dynamic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available , rate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional safety and toxic@@ ity studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow any particular danger to humans .
since no case studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except for those listed under 6.@@ 6 .

within the given time , the holder of the marketing authorisation has completed the following program of studies , the results of which form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk relationship .
this register will take longer term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me and data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase which breaks down certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kan@@ e ) , either in small quantity or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have occurred a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with other medicines Please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is intended for the intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians or medical specialists ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions emerged , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial oils .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer treatment ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ ci@@ pl@@ atin is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ antibiotic &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( in order to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given before or after the addition of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood type changes or with which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be decreased .
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ ric fixed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
the transformation of tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ig@@ ated ple@@ ur@@ am@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
in addition , A@@ lim@@ ta was compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin aver@@ aged 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously had received chemotherapy , mean survival with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells showed longer survival in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta than with the comparison medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
each flow bottle must be dissolved with a 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after the completion of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids must be given the day before and during the day of the tel@@ emet@@ ric signal and the day after the treatment .
at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken during the seven days before the first dose of tel@@ emet@@ ry .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first fixed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive tel@@ emet@@ ry , a complete blood pattern should be created prior to every application , including differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course a dose examination must take place taking into consideration the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood type or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dos@@ ages a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - in the presence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased side effect risk in patients at 65 years of age or over 65 years of age compared to patients at the age of 65 .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical studies , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dos@@ ages recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( in the case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients must be monitored and tel@@ emet@@ ry can not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again have a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ us number , plat@@ el@@ et number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous courses of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
less toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with tel@@ emet@@ ry must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic measure for reducing treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after the therapy .
all patients for whom a tel@@ emet@@ ric therapy is provided must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with tel@@ emet@@ ry ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients with these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ usion should be considered before the tel@@ emet@@ ric treatment .
5 primary cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with tel@@ emet@@ ry , if this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible impair@@ ment of the reproductive capacity is due to tel@@ emet@@ ry , men should be advised in advance of the treatment procedure to obtain advice regarding the preservation of sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ log@@ is@@ ics ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) can result in reduced exposure to tel@@ emet@@ ric acid with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore caution is advised if high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy , avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with tel@@ emet@@ ry ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use of rou@@ ters must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with tel@@ emet@@ ry .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Rev@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of tel@@ emet@@ ry in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy .
tel@@ emet@@ ry must not be used during pregnancy except if it is strictly necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible injury to the reproductive capacity is due to tel@@ emet@@ ry , men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment , to obtain advice regarding the block@@ age preservation .
it is not known whether mixed tel@@ emet@@ ry is mixed into the breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby can not be ruled out .

serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insul@@ ts and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in clinical trials with tel@@ emet@@ ric fixed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
from clinical trials , cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) were reported in patients with tel@@ emet@@ ric treatment .
from clinical studies , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure were reported in patients with tel@@ emet@@ ric @-@ mixed treatment .
cases of acute ren@@ al failure in tel@@ emet@@ ric mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis in patients were reported that were ir@@ radi@@ ated before , during or after their tel@@ emet@@ ric treatment ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( tel@@ emet@@ ry ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting the metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ yn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ gen@@ at@@ re@@ duk@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ gen@@ at@@ re@@ duk@@ t@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) are blocked , the following key enzymes in the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ in- and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des are blocked .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin revealed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful benefit of survival against such patients who were only treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the investig@@ ational medicine ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) associated with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was demonstrated in the case of the Lun@@ o- time cancer symptom scale in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted in the improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of the lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy achieved medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival in patients with SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ panel epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 47 ) , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for tel@@ emet@@ ric rates between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
medi@@ an PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 3@@ 0,@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total volume interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ lower limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
furthermore , the patients required the addition of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3,@@ 1 % versus 6.2 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4,@@ 3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of tel@@ emet@@ ry mixed as mon@@ otherapy were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
tel@@ emet@@ ry is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in the urine only 24 hours after the application .
tel@@ emet@@ ric fixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in the plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le @-@ dogs who had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( De@@ generation / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epitheli@@ al tissue ) .

it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who are taking All@@ i and can &apos;t list weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stage pass , fa@@ ec@@ es , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily stool , leaving o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with not sufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for reducing the weight of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under the age of 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
however , as or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any of the ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome ( see section 4.6 ) • Stop time ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or a fat @-@ rich diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic must be adjusted if necessary .
patients taking all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent the possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on the interactions of drugs and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
if war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are used in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally normally @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of an A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one single @-@ dose dose , a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at were observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal @-@ nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine as the absorption of taken fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the incidence of adverse events reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown sizes .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may lead to regi@@ mens in terms of possible resp@@ . actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal @-@ weight and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
either side effects or similar side effects reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported in the majority of Or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing reported after the market launch .
based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects that can be trac@@ ed back to the inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect lies in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ e and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , which blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in study course ( Table 1 ) and as percentage of those participating individuals who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average dietary change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the mean waist circum@@ ference was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .

oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives and all@@ i • The action of oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives to contrac@@ eption ( pill ) may be weakened or lifted if you have severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) .
before taking all@@ i to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you : • A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one to treat heart rhythms .
ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are allergic to it and • if you take drugs against high blood pressure , as possibly the dosage needs to be adjusted . • if you take drugs against high cholesterol levels as possibly the dosage needs to be adjusted .
for more useful information on the blue pages , see section 6 for more useful information on how to set your calorie targets and your fat to@@ ber@@ boundaries .
if you have a meal or a meal contains no fat , do not take a capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in combination with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional defici@@ encies ( see section 4 ) .
in order to get used to the new dietary habits , you are already beginning with a calorie and fat @-@ reduced diet prior to the first capsule taking .
di@@ aries are effective as you can understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably make it easier for you to change your eating habits .
in order to reach your target weight safely , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• You can eat fat in order to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional defici@@ encies ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before starting taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor beforehand if you are not used to exercise . • Dur@@ ing the intake and also after completion of the intake of all@@ i , remain physically active .
• Sh@@ all@@ i should not be taken for more than 6 months . • If you cannot determine a reduction in weight after twelve weeks of application of all@@ i , consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
in certain circumstances you have to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not about changing your diet for a short time and then returning to the old habits .
• If less than one hour has el@@ ap@@ sed since the last meal , take the capsule . • If more than one hour has el@@ ap@@ sed since the last meal , take no capsule .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and are caused by the ex@@ cre@@ tion of fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the beginning of the treatment , as at that time you may not have consistently reduced the fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutritional defici@@ encies : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and the size of the portions that you normally consume .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial after@@ taste , as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not store them after the exp@@ iry date specified on the cart@@ on . • Ke@@ ep tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low it . • You can take your daily dose of all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this pack .

obesity has influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
lasting weight loss , for example by improving diet and exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive influence on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ oules , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
please refer to the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
what amount of calories is appropriate for you can be found in the information below , indicating the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the operation mode of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional defici@@ encies . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week in weight without fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointment .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Lack of physical activity &quot; means that you do not work at all , climb stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium term physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal per day , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and to comply with them . • Sen@@ se is a food diary with information on the calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calorie and fat and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in conjunction with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
al@@ ma@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong causes of nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are the cause of nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti @-@ treatment ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there is insufficient information on the effects of this age group .
this means that the active substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , which prevents recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong respectively moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 by 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate causes of nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , 63 % were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted SA Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi in the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al pal@@ pation or indication of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents evaluated against tum@@ ours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single IV dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , it was shown that the simultaneous application of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , re@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant impact on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical studies , the most common adverse events reported in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar abund@@ ances of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ mode relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were conducted , but due to the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is presum@@ ably not an effective therapy for Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mc@@ g / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mc@@ g / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life time : 4 hours ) or 100 mg / m2 d@@ ag@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life equivalent to 7.@@ 3 hours ) that was given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double blind study 6@@ 67 patients receiving strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients given intraven@@ ously 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron .
results from studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical studies for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron administered intraven@@ ously in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
following IV administration a gradual removal of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3 90 μ / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
following IV administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration measured at 42 ± 34 % was measured in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular carcin@@ oma patients between day 1 and day 5 .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations it emerged that once daily intraven@@ ous 0,@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to a value measured after one @-@ time IV administration of 0.@@ 75 mg , the C@@ max was higher after the one @-@ time injection of 0.@@ 75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated via the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies on the metabolism we have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the is@@ o@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
in 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clearance of 53 ± 29 ml / min after a single IV injection in healthy patients .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal eli@@ min@@ ation time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only in ex@@ positions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies there was evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block I@@ on channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately the 30@@ x of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al marks ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and because Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is very low for humans .
the holder of this authorization for the placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for the marketing of the drug approved in the context of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative report in which the approval of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that al@@ ph@@ e@@ um should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient already approved in the EU ( also referred to as &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
al@@ ph@@ e@@ um should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
a micro@@ scopic examination shows damage to the liver tissue , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ norm@@ alize .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates it to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon presented data confirming the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( Ac@@ tual structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference physician to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients were hospit@@ alized after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood were reported ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged What were the biggest concerns that prompted the CH@@ MP to prohi@@ bit the marketing authorization ?
moreover , concerns were expressed in such a way that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed was not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon the disease was re@@ treated with more patients than with the reference physician ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ e@@ X@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study was not adequately vali@@ dated to determine the extent to which the drug causes an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ ids ( fis@@ sur@@ es or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients in plac@@ ebo addressed the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at skin findings , about 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by or presum@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the surface of the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ z@@ ards , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the introduction of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be taken into account ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying retina o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary un@@ infected open wounds the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or wor@@ sen@@ ing of the infected place occurs after a 2 to 3 day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on poor skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo cannot be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol the average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max of top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on pe@@ eled skin of healthy adult men increased by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate with regard to a statement regarding the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to systemic antibiotics .
whether breast@@ feeding is continued or terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , the benefit of breast@@ feeding is to weigh the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which used Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common side effect was irrit@@ ation at the administered place , affecting about 1 % of the patients .
effect Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic D@@ eri@@ v@@ at from P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is obtained by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly P@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial giant which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
binding at this binding site inhi@@ bit the pep@@ tide transfer , partially block P @-@ binding sites and prevent the normal formation of active 50 @-@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance to the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin seem question@@ able in at least some types of infection , advice should be sought by experts .
no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us were detected , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ compliance with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of stra@@ ins with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
in a study with healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and on lowered skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment twice a day for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
samples took place on days 3 or 4 in adults before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , less participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro @-@ examination of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vivo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were no signs of limited fertility in male or female rats at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ul@@ led skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between 1 and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , with a protection against hepatitis B possibly only after administration of the second dose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immun@@ isation process , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses can lead to an end .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix may be given or another hepatitis A or B vaccine .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contains the same ingredients as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approved since 1996 and the Twin@@ CA@@ rix vaccine approved since 1997 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ CA@@ rix adults and Twin@@ CA@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults have identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as a proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month interval and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix led a month after the final injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of Ambi@@ rix &apos;s protection was similar in six months and a 12 month interval between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active agents , any of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix all over the world .
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ying with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of the election and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster is desired for both hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) are in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully ensured that immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a hepatitis A vaccine will need a booster shots as protection , since they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory even if antibodies are no longer det@@ ectable .
3 As with all vacc@@ ines , the possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the injection of the vaccine .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the random@@ ized vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA types of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of ha@@ em@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons suffering from disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibody @-@ value is reached after pri@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation , so that in these cases the gift of additional vacc@@ inations may be required .
because intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ etus , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously , as in these cases , after intra@@ muscular administration , bleeding can occur .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined massage - m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that a sufficient immune response may not be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was similar to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ om@@ ery and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ination formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines with a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines were administered at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and wear@@ iness on a basis of calculation per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a comp@@ ut@@ ational basis for each person .
pain was observed after the application of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % in subjects following the dose of the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix reported pain in comparison to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated using the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the frequency of mat@@ ch@@ iness was however comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % among the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ence group was similar to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally significant .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose administered to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ tide conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose administered to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard compound with three doses .
in 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month of 2 and 6 after the 3 @-@ dose vaccine was administered significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were obtained in a clinical comparative study for 1 to 11 year @-@ olds on a month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines either received a 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable to the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year at the same time with the booster secre@@ tion of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation of adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and serum conversion rates as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing on possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charge is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through food and drinks containing viruses , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ents .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series with 2 doses has been completed .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines , ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or dise@@ ased at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis A or Hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you / your child already have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) has shown .
an allergic reaction can manifest by it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child already have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will be inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle in persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / its body &apos;s def@@ enses , or if you / your child undergo a h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child can take other medicines ( including those that have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / has been given or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have / has or has been planned in the near future .
however , in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
normally , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you / your child already showed an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ ayed cans ) : • pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • head@@ aches • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ ayed cans ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • gastro@@ intestinal disorders
further side effects reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 distributed doses ) are reported :
these include spati@@ ally limited or extended stro@@ kes , which can be it@@ chy or ves@@ ic@@ ular , swelling of the eye area and face , terri@@ fic breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness .
flu @-@ like complaints , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , diseases of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or movement ability of some parts of the body , severe head@@ aches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , interruption of normal brain functions
f@@ ain@@ ting inflammation of some blood vessels may be discomfort or feeling of illness , loss of appetite , diar@@ rhe@@ a and abdominal pain change liver function tests lymp@@ h node swelling ( bru@@ ises ) , caused by the amount of blood plat@@ el@@ et .
23 In@@ form your doctor or chem@@ ist if one of the side effects listed you / your child significantly impaired or you notice side effects not indicated in this pack supplement .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data known since obtaining the first permit for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix was positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only put into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposition .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y hose ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , because am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo , that is , without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ di@@ fication in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or fla@@ vor@@ ing , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevent ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of the approval there was limited information about this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for the use if hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake required for the growth and development .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carb@@ amide phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a when the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately .
each AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablet contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium bic@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and associated with sodium retention and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium poly@@ but@@ yl phosph@@ ates occurs via the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
a sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased neur@@ on loss .
there was also a delayed ri@@ pen@@ ing of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into the breast milk in humans , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of the patients and at 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ t@@ ative dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ or top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an occasional single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intraven@@ ous dosage of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an active compound based on acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to form phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
in terms of sto@@ ich@@ i@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rates are produced for each gram , between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g. of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infected , and the disease led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues .
by h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium poly@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with those patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
survival rate was 98 % in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ erter Tran@@ scar@@ path@@ i @-@ Man@@ gels ) that recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate is known to be oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , and phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ amine is produced .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate for so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were determined .
according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ t@@ ology or ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in opath@@ ies had no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma levels were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
secre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no lam@@ ell@@ ar effects in the case of toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either or@@ ally taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing ) or by a gastro@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carb@@ amide phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium bic@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium bic@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat @-@ fl@@ utes were suspended before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , there was l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain @-@ cor@@ tex .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ t@@ ative dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ or top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
in terms of sto@@ ich@@ i@@ omet@@ ry , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess phosph@@ ate .
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rates are produced for each gram , between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g. of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat measured 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the drug over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium poly@@ but@@ y@@ ate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products which accum@@ ulate in the body after the consumption of proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as So@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , ob@@ struction of hearing , dis@@ ori@@ ti@@ bility , memory defic@@ its and deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
you are not allowed to use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date specified on the cardboard box and the container .
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and content of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval form , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out , notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as So@@ dium poly@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed on the same single doses or via a stomach fi@@ st@@ pan ( hose which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Apply a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spoon gran@@ ules from the container .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of chest pain with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress up@@ lift &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients with a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , the patient often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab und A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift from GP@@ I - was as effective in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as much as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , an@@ det@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in with respect to all indicators , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who had a recent bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd approval for the marketing of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ raising inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned .
the recommended starting dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in a further sequence , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed after clinical requirements for 4 to 12 hours .
before the procedure , a pin drop of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial IV drop of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and one immediately following IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ some Bol@@ us @-@ application of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second captive bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the dosage intake should be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt recovery should be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular ha@@ par@@ in .
• noted hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other components or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or increased risk of bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if there are most bleeding in the arter@@ ial spot in the case of PCI patients in bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may cause bleeding during the treatment .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular Rev@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is once again reached the level pre @-@ treatment .
based on the knowledge about the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te Units ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with plat@@ el@@ et units or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ parameters are regularly monitored in each case .
animal experimental studies are insufficient in terms of pregnancy , fet@@ al / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ ox@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
in both the bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din group and in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
heavy bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less common among bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ines than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ ine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ HA ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY serious hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following occur@@ ren@@ ces : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the area of punc@@ ture , reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in from ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding order , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge loc@@ ali@@ zations with more than 0.1 % ( occasional ) were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ ine in 6000 patients undergoing PCI .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less common among bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ines than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects that are not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken down and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to the signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ o@@ inhibit@@ or which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is present in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in has slowly split the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din was unable to in@@ duce Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past .
in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ vali@@ d@@ ine shows a dose of dose and concentration depending on the an@@ tic@@ ular effects caused by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the following patients , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the operation should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ ox@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the on@@ set of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or at the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography in 72 hours , were equally distributed over the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on four@@ fold and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in table 10 .
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ab@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that , as a pep@@ tide , bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine enters into its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ val@@ or@@ isation of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism resulted from spl@@ itting the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or upper arm or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or to process insulin .
insulin li@@ sin@@ ess differs very slightly from the insulin insulin level , and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter active life than a short @-@ acting insulin insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged four to 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with type 1 diabetes adults , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin li@@ pped .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human acting insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra might have to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH an approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
due to reduced glucose availability and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin must be reduced in patients with impair@@ ment of the liver function .
any change of intensity , brand ( hero@@ ine ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ ret@@ ar@@ ded , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can change the insulin demand .
3 An insufficient dose or abor@@ tion of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be performed under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage necessary .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the effectiveness of the insulin used and can therefore change if the treatment plan is changed .
the substances that increase the blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in con@@ stric@@ ting enzymes ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ co@@ y@@ cin , nit@@ ro@@ ot@@ ene , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ an and reser@@ pine can be allevi@@ ated or absent from the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter @-@ regulation .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human@@ oid in relation to pregnancy , fet@@ al / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin inj@@ ections are transferred into human breast milk , but in general , insulin does not enter into the breast milk nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application .
in the following , the adverse drug processes known from clinical studies are listed , group@@ ed by system components and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ ors , anxiety , unusual fatigue or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive lying , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is fo@@ amed to continuously change the injection area within the injection area , as a result a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ics with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by an appropriately trained person or by intraven@@ ous dosage of glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the serious hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin li@@ s@@ sin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin insulin .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , insulin lens in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 e / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glucose @-@ lowering effect , just like the human@@ oid .
insulin li@@ sin@@ ess has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than the human@@ oid .
it was evident from the data that a comparable post @-@ post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was achieved in an application of insulin gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic 2 minutes before the meal , as with a human acting insulin insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin was filled 2 minutes before the meal , better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control was achieved than with a human acting insulin inj@@ ectable 2 minutes before the meal .
if the insulin closure is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with a human acting insulin insulin , which is given 2 co @-@ nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin in administration 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of meal compared to human acting insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human acting insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin inj@@ ections under administration 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after beginning of the meal compared to normal normal insulin insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
