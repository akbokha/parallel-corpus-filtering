<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations on the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirling thoughts and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal spirits) alternating with periods of normal sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders, if the oral ingestion of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for intake or melting tablets in patients who are experiencing difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between neurons.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is probably mainly known as "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent as the neurotransmitter, works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl contributes to normalize the brain activity, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing reoccurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting from increased anxiety over a period of two hours compared to a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent reoccurrence in 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased unrest, compared with the Loracepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body resorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks, and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similar to Loracepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (incontroled sugar), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (drowsiness), vomiting, nausea, drowsinus (elevated salivation), drowsinus (elevated salivation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and with which the manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Aripiprazole, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the Committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval for the establishment of Abilify in the entire European Union to the company Ottenka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, independent of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazl (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide with patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including delicate and maligular form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occurred during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, caution should be taken with caution in patients with varicose seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events associated with Aripiprazl treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipic, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is regarded as clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'poor' metaboards, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common gift of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseinase inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="55">After inserting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 Inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be attributed with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextroscopic morphine / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (Varcolorin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromatically orphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">This medicine may not be used during pregnancy because of the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the concerns that arise in the reproduction studies of the animal, unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to use dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazl has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined in accordance with the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazl, a total decreased incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinson's, thystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiranzol treatment and 13.1% in placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients with lanzaphine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiranzol treatment and 17.6% for those suffering from lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the Aripiprazole and Placebo group of patients with potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphorase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiruzol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdose with Aripiprazl alone has been observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the efficacy of a haematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazl; however, it is unlikely that haematalysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing, since Aripiprazol has a high plasma eradication.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partiallagonal effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a-receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D1- and D3-receptor and to the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a-receptor as well as a mediocre affinity to the dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to the alpha-1-adrenergigen and the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In dosage of Aripiprazole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and at the putt.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of the responder's response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of relapse, which was 34% in the Aripiprzol group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an olfactory-controlled, multinational double blind study for schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', an increase in weight of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx. 5).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, comparable to that of lithium or semi-operidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, in week 12, Aripiprazol showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the Mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion diagnostic with Aripiprazol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial for over 26 weeks, followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole found herself superior to the prevention of a bipolar backfall, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylasing of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkylamation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Elimination Time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and for approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolites above CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients with no gender-related effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences regarding the ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in patients with various liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impact of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional safety psychology studies, toxicity in repeated doses, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, thus only limited or no significance for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) at the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of Aripiprazol in the bile ducal of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or between 16- and 81ples of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of Hydroxy- Aripiprazole found no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for more than 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to 3 and 11 times the average steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">As soon as it is clinically appropriate, the treatment should be terminated with Aripiprazl injection solution and commenced with the oral application of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the resorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended in circumvention of adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripitrazol injection solution in patients with detachment and behavioural disorders, which were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including delicate and maligular form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia occurred during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipic, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania based on comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle observed and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedan was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy volunteers Aripiprazol (15 mg dose) were used as one-time intra-muscular one and both received Loracepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a stomach acid blocker, decreases the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is regarded as clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'poor' metaboards, the common application of highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinase inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="160">After inserting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 Inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Loracepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedan was greater compared with that after the sole application of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical studies with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined in accordance with the following criteria: commonly (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral Aripiprazole as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those suffering from lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiranzol treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the Aripiprazole and Placebo group of patients with potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Enhancements of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiruzol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disturbances was the Aripiprazl injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements of detachment / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as detachment and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of detachment and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Loracepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The moderate improvement of the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score for the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Loracepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggravation, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population, but a statistical significance could be determined by a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of the responder's response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of relapse, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Ogliapin controlled, multinational double blind study for schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', more than 7% increase in weight compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx. 5).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion diagnostic with Aripiprazol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks, followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole found herself superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar backfall, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazol AUC is 90% larger the AUC after administration of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects, the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazl injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra-muscular layer.</seg>
<seg id="185">Studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous administration did not concern safety-related concerns based on maternal exposure, which lay in 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) over the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (orally) for safety psychology, toxicity in repeated doses, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; thus, they have only limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) at the recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of the Sulphate metabolites from Aripiprazol in the bile ducal of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or between 16 and 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters of which had an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in singular application or monotherapy) was compared with a medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce adverse events).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients with Abraxane responded to the treatment compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only those who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer were seen in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival, no difference between the medicines.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before or before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that unlike other paclitaxel-containing drugs, drugs should not be given to other medicines in order to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the placing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing treatment is not shown (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophats &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dosage should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy degree 3, treatment is interrupted until improvement is achieved in degrees 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">There are no studies with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data to recommend dose adjustment in patients with impairment of kidney function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which could have considerably other pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the patients no further Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated, until the neutrophils decrease again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardiotoxicity has not been proven, cardiac incursions are not unusual in the indicated patient's collective, especially in patients with early anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If there are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in patients with the use of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual anti-corrosive and constilling methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women of childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women of childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane will be advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sparrow preservation prior to the treatment because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible barrenness.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often) which can affect the traffic tightness and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most remarkable hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows adverse events associated with the dose of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate dehydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, bloating, tongue burning, dry mouth, toothpaste, loose stools, oophagitis, lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding diseases of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, dyno, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, musculoskeletal pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a specific case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a anti-microtubules agent that promotes the amalgamation of the microtubules from the tubula and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their deolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubulous network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transluctose of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumreceptor and because of the albuminous protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm, unlinked studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was administered in the form of an infusion of about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer for over 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had an impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy first, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastatic disease and 19% due to metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving First-Line therapy are outlined below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity in relation to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy degree 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural progression of peripheral neuropathy to decay to baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180 minutes infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft tissue attachment of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute intravenous injections of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">After the Abraxane administration the Clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microbe and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urination of the unmodified agent was 4% of the total dose of 6α hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available about patients at the age of 75 years, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light for more than 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anti-carcinogenic drug and, as in other potentially toxic substances, caution should be observed when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, sodium chloride infusion fluid has to be injected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute to a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion fluid.</seg>
<seg id="327">After full addition of the solution, the water bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid material.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the hatch should be swung slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until a complete suspension of the powder is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitations or sinking materials are visible, the water bottle must be inverted gently again in order to achieve a complete residual suspension before applying.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biologic drug already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood cancers, in which complications may occur in connection with a blood transfusion, if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Abdiamed has to be started under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses that the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make self-bleeding, Abdiamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be done by the patient or his caregiver provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by erythropoietine deficiency, or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In the course of a major study with 479 patients, Abseamed was compared to a primary study of 479 patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected with Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before being either switched to either Abseamed or to continue receiving Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the start of the study and the assessment period between the weeks 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of dimmamed under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were switched to abuamed were upheld in the same degree as for those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abdiamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abdiamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Amed amed as injections under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the drug has been proven to be a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo, according to the European Union regulations.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces Abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medice medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG a approval for the distribution of diamed amed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumors, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, which receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (for example cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia in the start of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned larger operative interventions which require a large amount of blood (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood, abuamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml will be applied which cannot participate in an autologous blood donor program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients with haemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5,9 - 6,8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease; therefore, the physician must evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of disease.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values over or below the haemoglobin target concentration can occasionally be observed in a patient.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this haemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of anemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than those in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than those in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by means of intravenous administration, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and follow-up may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease; therefore, the physician must evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of disease.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this haemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for controlling the anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of the haemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticuloycyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl have increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value has increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticuloycyte number to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, an response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood count is required, in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight should be received twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donor programme - to make large iron reserves available before the start of the abuamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (Day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperative 300 I.U. / kg every 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients diagnosed with any erythropoetin in erythroblastomenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive either Abdiamed or any other erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastomenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month prior to the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic porous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">For patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and who are not able to participate in an autologous blood donor program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, escort or atrophy diseases: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, vascular disease of the otides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred cardiac infarction or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as a reduction of haemoglobin values (1-2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes of a non-contact (iron, folate acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminiorotoxicity, infections or inflammations, blood loss and haemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticuloytic value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the reticulocytes index), is reduced (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other reason for a loss of action is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and a study of the bone marrow should be considered as a diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abdiamed in patients with a risk for antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropox-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the use of epoetins when the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of anedemymptoms and avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of increasing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">Tumor patients under chemotherapy should consider epoetin alfa a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anaemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of holding the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision on the application of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk weighing under the participation of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for greater elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible prior to the beginning of epoetin alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial anemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl there is an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine has not shown that tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia can improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy were returned if haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8,7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">When epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be checked and the Ciclosporin dosage should be adjusted to the increasing hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF concerning hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarcts, cerebral ischemic attacks, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thromboses, arterial thromboses, arterial thromboses, arterial thromboses, retinalthromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys have been reported in patients suffering from epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most frequent side effect during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>

<seg id="576">The main indicator of effectiveness was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under acetlasta (without other osteoporosis therapies) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to those in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% in comparison to all patients under acetplaca (with or without other osteoporosis therapies).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Acupa had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Acupa occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to cioledronomic acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with aclasta are exposed to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The Accord producer provides information material for doctors prescribing acetlasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include: • Contract infection in pregnancy and in breastfeeding women • Required of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and healthy eating • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of acetylene is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Acupa should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol can be reduced by using acetamol or ibuprofen just after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary as the bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) are not recommended because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypoglycaemia must be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the beginning of therapy (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of citric acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokaltsmia can develop, whose maximum occurs within the first ten days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium twice a day, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, bad oral hygiene) should be given a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry before applying bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental interventions, no data are available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoarthritis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen following the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of cases of atrial fibrillation reported as serious side effects was increased in patients who received Aclasta (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients who received placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), random (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function Disorder Zoledronic acid was associated with kidney function disorders which, as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases of acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">Changes in the creatinin clearance (measured annually prior to administering) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as impaired kidney function were similar in a clinical study in osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Acupa versus 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal range of fluctuation (less than 2,10 mmol / l) were observed in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in patients with the disease Paget.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplemental amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study on preventing clinical fractures after hip fracture and in the disease Paget trials (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently littled hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of acetlasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After administration of cioledronomic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteochrombosis in the jaw area was occasionally treated, especially in cancer patients, about osteoarthritis (primarily in the jaw area) that were treated with bisphosphonates including citric acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area in patients treated with aclasta and in a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of an overdose leading to a clinically relevant hypocemia, a compensation can be achieved by the administration of calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been demonstrated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) T-Score for scarves ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on the body fractures of Acupa decreased significantly over a period of three years and the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures after one year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduction in the risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetate fractures showed an equally lasting effect over three years resulting in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) aclasta increased bone density on the lumbar spine, hips and distal radius significantly compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the lumbar density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the thigh bone decreased by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology for 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic bone.</seg>
<seg id="628">In contrast to placebo, a microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone sales marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propositid of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups from 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced 30% compared to baseline and was kept at 28% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">The B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, compared to placebo treatment, the BMD increased the overall height of the BMD at all points of time.</seg>
<seg id="636">Compared to placebo treatment, the treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% in total joints and 4.3% at the lower neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical effectiveness in males In HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Acupa-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (CZOL446M2308), the once yearly administration of acetlasta compared to the once weekly dose of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar BMD after 24 months versus the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was investigated in patients and patients over the age of 30 using radiologically confirmed, mainly mild to moderate Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase in accordance with the 2.6 times up to 3.0ples of age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg risedronate once daily for 2 months has been demonstrated in two six-month comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months versus the baseline for acetlasta and risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients classified as Responder at the end of the six-month trial (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with acetlasta and 107 patients with risedronas, who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with acetlasta could be maintained in an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg reflexic acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After this, the plasma crucible rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life times t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination period with a terminal Elimination Time of ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dose 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the area below the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance by cytochrom-P450 enzymes is unlikely because cyoledronomic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the cioledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in the 64 patients examined.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction to a creatinin clearance up to 35 ml / min requires no dose adjustment of the cioledron juice.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe kidney function problems (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-Latvian single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg of body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC (6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous use was given the renal tolerability of zoledronylic acid in rats, adding 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (an cumulative dose which corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to cumulated exposures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects of other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as the I.V. injection site occurred.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in trials with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysical metaphysics of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, a teratogenicity of doses above 0.2 mg / kg was observed as outer and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was expressed at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum levels of serum.</seg>

<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially oestrogens that are made from androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Paget Morbus, bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is built in an unorganized way, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing bone reconstruction, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus strengthening bones.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the general public The present document is a summary of the European Public Evaluation Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations on the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients), in which metformin (a diabetinal medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), metformin alone can not be satisfactorily adjusted in the highest tolerated dose alone.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resinous or insulin, the previous dosage of the Sulfonyl resinous or insulin can be maintained with the commencement of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonylurea and insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, enabling type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of acetone was studied in tripletherapies; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resinous, in addition they received either acetone or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">This led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels have been lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy trial, the effect of adding an additional dose of acetone to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylurea in a decrease of HbA1c values was 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients who took acetone in addition to insulin showed a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were blurred vision, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothalthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">It may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that acetone should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients within the framework of a single use. metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited authorisation to transport Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white until whitish, round, domed and carry on one side the marker" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under the age of 18, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, there was an increase in the reports of heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased outcome (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzymes must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazone should be presided over to the clinical evaluation of the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases related to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a minor reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred in the treatment with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparators with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive Pioglitazone as oral two or triple-combination therapy with a sulfonylurea or as two-fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch a diabetic macular edema, including pioglitazone, was reported in the treatment with diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients report on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological investigation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductaskinhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of pioglitazone by three times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% decrease in the AUC of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pioglitazone the hyperinsulin resistance resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreased and thereby lessening the availability of the metabolic substrates for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not invaluable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refractive index of the lens as observed in other hypoglycemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, ALT ascents more than three times the upper limit of the normal range often occurred as in placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazone bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch rarely has been reported about heart failure under Pioglitazone, however, more often when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events in bone fractures of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies was carried out over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in groups treated with Pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive trial running over a period of 3.5 years, fractures were performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ) (PPAR-γ)), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glycosiness in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazide, as monotherapy, was continued over two years to study the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin despite a three-month improvement phase were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the treated group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients proved to be statistically significant in comparison to initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week examination of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, a reduction in overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids as well as an increase in HDL cholesterol levels and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels were observed, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced total plasmatglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazide, and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone while values decreased under metformin and Gliclasia.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the triglyceride levels but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this effect on triglyceride absorption as well as hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive trial, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral appliance pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma are normally achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to efficacy corresponds roughly to the threefold of the efficacy of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies it was proven that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After orally application of a radioactive pioglitazone in humans, the marker was mainly found in the rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination period of unchanged pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolite is between 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral-clearance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric hypertrophy occurred.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pioglitazone the hyperinsulin resistance resulting in the gestation decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolidindexes led to increased frequency of colon tumors.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with either Pioglitazone or Gliclazide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients proved to be statistically significant in comparison to initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the triglycerides, but also improved postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both on the effect on the Tryglyceride absorption and the hepatic tryglienterid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortalities, non-mortal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularisation and revascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that cardiovascular long-term risks are not associated with taking pioglitazon.</seg>

<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose level has improved dramatically, for example, by intensified insulin therapy, can detect hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding thickness, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, humanoid or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (through recombinant DNA towards insulin of animal origin) can lead to a change in dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when changing to actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The physician must consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients to always ask for other drugs taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4. both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which may occur in a non-controlled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>

<seg id="886">However, hypoglycemia can develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemics can be treated by oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemics with unconsciousness are treated with an intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1,0 mg) or by glucose given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of split (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional safety psychology studies, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not allow any particular hazards for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the surface under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat were dosed proportionately after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in the AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional ascent.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After ingestion of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the Cmax is approximately 2.8-3.2µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Alendronate studies The therapeutic similarity of alendronate once weekly 70 mg (n = 519) and alendronate 10 mg a day (n = 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in postmenopausal women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) and in fracture intervention study (FIT: n = 6,459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In phase III studies, the average intake of BMD with alendronate was 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.8% on the spine, 5.9% at the femur and 7.8% on the trouser.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the group treated with alendronate, a reduction of 48% (alendronate 3.2% versus placebo 6.3%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the climbs of the BMD from the spine and trough continued to stop; also the BMD of the femur and the entire body was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">It consisted of two placebo-controlled trials in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily dose of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new edging fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Following an intravenous reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0,64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nightly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability decreased accordingly to about 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects, the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day over five days) did not lead to clinically meaningful change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in average in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies in rats show that alendronate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after IV administered intravenous dosage of 1 mg / kg, but then rapidly dispersed into the bone or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After IV administration of a single dose of 14C alendronate about 50% of the radioactive substance was excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the rotting.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate amounted to 71 ml / min and systemic clearing not exceeded 200 ml / min.</seg>

<seg id="1402">As Tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft are already in use in the EU, the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, whereas the application of Advocard with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin was compared.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after one year of treatment (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplantation or a resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter follow-up studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant and examined how incision is absorbed by the body in comparison with Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and transplantation of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including sub- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and daily dosage; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases and on blood reflection provisions (see below "Recommendations")</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to advance, the Tacrolimus valley mirrors should be checked before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a Talking, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Meticulous and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus sebum are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adventif in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure during immediate transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a low-clearance substance, an adjustment of the law can take several days until steady state is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the patient's condition in the first postoperative phase does not allow oral ingestion of medicines, the Tacrolimus treatment can be initiated intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an infusion fluid) with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of the application For the suppression of graft rejection, the immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral advance therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dosage in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments may later be necessary as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advance therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dosage in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - Adjustment of Prograf to Advagraf Must a transplant recipient of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules should be switched to once daily intake of Advagraf, so this conversion in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose, is to take place.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After switching from other immunosuppressant drugs to advant once a day, the treatment must begin with the recommended oral initial dose for prophylaxis of corneal graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients who are switched to advance, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with Advocate in lung, pancreatic and colorectal transplanted patients, was administered in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining blood levels in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the renal function exerts no influence on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum creatine index, a calculation of the inocinine inocation and a monitoring of the urinal volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advagraf In case of switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the Talking level in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases by means of full blood tacrolimus-Talking controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tacrolimus sebum during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talking of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after transitioning from Prograf to advant, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since advocacy is a drug with a low clearance, adjustments to the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talking of Tacrolimus in full blood is usually in the range of 5-20 ng / ml and for kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant receivers, blood concentrations in the range between 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplant (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded wording in advance.</seg>
<seg id="1442">No clinical data for the retarded wording advant are still available for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other plant remedies should be avoided during a treatment with advant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus levels is offered in the blood, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf, a hypertrophy referred to as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore also occur under Adventif.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infection, fluid overloading and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of maligning skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, symptoms of PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and vision disturbances, should have a radiological examination (e.g..</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf contains hard capsules, retarded, lactose, in patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption, special caution is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and, consequently, increase or decrease the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood serum with simultaneous administration of substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dosage to maintain even concentrations according to the current conditions (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was associated with antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macrolilid antibiotic Erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of the gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as it is used for acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other tacrolimus drugs is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can interfere with their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the exposure to hormone exposure, decisions on contraceptive measures should be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus potentially lessen the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolongs their half-life.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding to erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacodynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to mediate the effects of tacrolimus through its binding to a cytosole protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cellular interior.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent blocking of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain series of lymphocykin genes.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of Tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in people with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting caused by the deficiency of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of use depend on whether advocates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clots such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced by a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to enable the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advocate is a medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is produced differently, so that the drug does not contain any protein of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, among them a study with 53 children under six, the drug application was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of Advocate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood counts with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advocate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advocate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted the company Baxter AG a permit for the marketing of Advocates throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of factor VIII deficiency, the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasmastification (in% of the standard or in I.U. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat injections every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">An appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma levels is advised during the treatment course to control the administered dose and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The speed of administration should depend on the patient's condition, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII targeted IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using a modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnesite known inhibitors development, switching from recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of Factor VIII (5 patients), which showed a higher risk of the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rarely &lt; 1 / 000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood clots factor VIII-Spiegels occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VIII- level in plasma and the clearance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, a FVIII inhibitor was found in none of the 53 paediatric patients with age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study formed 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell proteins, but no signs or symptoms showed any allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients, the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as a positive, but considered that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, the CHMP decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal process in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited granted the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to formally withdraw his application for the marketing of Advance in the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissues that connect and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically altered in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus can not trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have injected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene present in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the lower abdomen area, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the company's answers to the questions he asked, there were still some questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP generates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently proved that Advexin injection in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore provides benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also noted concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that advocate can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet which should be taken with or without food entirely with a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cloned.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms other than constipation of the nose, the patients who received aaze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% in patients who received pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who received desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunting), mouth-dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratradin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, with adrenergic active agents or Loratadin (another medicine for allergy treatment).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer from hypertension glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular disease including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism), hyperthyroidism (cerebral hypertension) or a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aeropol throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking them, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms subsided.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can continue as a monotherapy in case of need with desloratradin.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze contains Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within the 2 weeks after termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, pilergid, cabergoline, ergotamine, Dihydropoamin or other deongestiva (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazoline etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient's collective and the data do not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or headaches) must be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, obstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be carried out at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistaminika otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">However, in clinical trials with desloratradin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole was administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratradin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor tests, no significant differences could be found between patients treated with desloratradin and placebo, regardless of whether or not desloratadin alone or alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In vivo CYP3A4 inhibited Lloratadin and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerosaze during pregnancy is not secured, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproduction studies are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a dizziness which may result in impaired traffic or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible sequels.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, prekordiale pain, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary freeze and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophilen as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-seless to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including the strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. daily there was no increased incidence of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged 12 to 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis took part, in which 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine-antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall results for the symptoms (besides nasal mucosa swelling), was significantly higher than in monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerofaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than in monotherapy with desloratradin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerofaze tablets did not show any significant differences in terms of age, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the body weight of desloratradin, 3-hydroxydesloratradin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacokinetic multidose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of desloratadin were badly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine, after the addition of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent, was the exposure of an aerofaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional safety psychology studies, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, the preclinical data with desloratradin do not allow any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of lauatadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin, severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives, hives, swelling) or skin rashes were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart hunting, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, varicose seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of inflammation of the liver and over cases of conspicuous hepatic values were also very rarely reported.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness was measured by determining the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadruples, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children are harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (number of symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria the decrease of the total score after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in the placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratradin, loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing on the market of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of desloratradin in adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should take place according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms have been stopped and resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with desloratadin tablets where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the effects of alcohol were not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that there may be headedness in very rare cases, which may result in impaired traffic or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in different indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse event was headaches, this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratradin and in 6.9% of the patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, in which up to 45 mg of desloratradin (nine-times clinical dose) were administered.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophilen as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P selectins to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses, in which desloratradin was administered daily for more than 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study in which desloratradin was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no longer an extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including the strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated on behalf of other forms of urticaria as the underlying pathophysiology, notwithstanding the etiology, is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine release is a causal factor in all age-related diseases, it is expected that in other forms of the urticaria, desloratadin, besides the chronic idiopathic urticaria, results in an improvement in symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing the size and number of quadrilaterals at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the study was excluded from the study by the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratradin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced sleep and wakefulness as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patient demos were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratradin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of desloratradin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In vivo, desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3European and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratradin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) had no effect on the availability of desloratradin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with theLloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity profile of theRoquatadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional safety and toxicity studies, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not allow any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Erius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data which support the treatment of an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical abnormalities, anamnesis, physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise desloratradin and experience greater substance exposure (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children from 2 to 11 years, which is fully metabolized, is identical to that of children who are normally metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose adsorption or sucrose-isomaltase- insufficiency should not use this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Aerius tablets where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the effects of alcohol were not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at the recommended dose 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multidose study of adults and adolescents who were administered up to 45 mg of desloratradin (nine-times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11, who were eligible for an antihistamine treatment, received a daily dose of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged 6 to 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">There was no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratradin was used daily for more than 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which desloratradin was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, no increased incidence of sleepiness compared to placebo was noted.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets were not affected by psychomotor impairment in adults and adolescents in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol-induced power impairment nor an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets will effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing the size and number of quadrilaterals at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited metabolic phenotype was comparable with adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulations of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are restricted.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The strain (AUC) by desloratradin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax is approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications of clinically relevant drug-cumulation after once daily use of desloratradin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies showed that the AUC and Cmax values of desloratradin in paediatric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the dioracadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="1798">In the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses, in which desloratradin was used for up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1799">In a clinical-pharmacological study in which desloratradin was administered in a dosage of 45 mg a day (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no longer an extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1800">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. daily there was no increased incidence of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1801">In a 17 single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured values of the flight performance, including the strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1802">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1803">As shown on the basis of the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively decreases the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>

<seg id="1811">The efficacy and safety of Aerius 2.5 mg of processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years has not been proven so far.</seg>
<seg id="1812">The overall frequency of side effects between the desloratadine syrup and the placebo group was the same and did not deviate significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients.</seg>
<seg id="1813">At the recommended dose, Aerius poured a tablet as a bioequivalent to the Aerius 5 mg of conventional tablet formulation and the Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate for the engaging formulation of desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. informed the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) officially, that the company accepts its application for permission to prevent aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the H5N1 tribe (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic outbreak occurs when a new trunk of the flu virus appears that can easily spread from humans to humans because humans have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">When the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as "foreign-alien" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to produce antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this trunk.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane grommet of the virus was purified with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as foreign objects), purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study had not been carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>

<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution, but it cannot be taken together with knight caviar as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Generase should only be decreed if the doctor has checked the antiviral medicines the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood is that the virus is addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between the ages of 4 and 12, and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The angenerase, which was enhanced with low doses of low doses, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults, who used earlier protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor, more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml under Agenerase than in placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few responded to the treatment of the children previously treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who earlier had been treated with protease inhibitors, the viral load enhanced with ritonavir increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase combined with ritonavir increased the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients taking St. John's wort (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines which are broken down as well as angenerase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As in other medicines for HIV, patients who are taking Agenerase are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee noted that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with kritonavir in patients who previously had not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information was available for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited approval for the marketing of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasbestos (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules are to be administered for pharmacokinetic boosting of amniavir along with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amateavir should be performed taking into account the individual viral disease resistance and pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for intake on one milligram per milligram basis are not exchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amrupavir twice daily along with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medications.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the enhancing additive of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amrupavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of aggrazing in combination with low doses of knight avir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Generase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Concurrent application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction; in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also mediums of cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir during intake of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy will not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of knight caviar and in combination with other antiretroviral medications (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral therapy have increased risk of liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In the event of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show increased incidence of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Because the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regular Revatio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking these drugs at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of Ambuavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amateavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however the information is insufficient to assess the nature of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of oppiate removal, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycolcontent of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set to 5 in duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other illnesses that were prescribed medicines that are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In the case of ill patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in haemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hematomas are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of initiation of an antiretroviral therapy (ART), an anti-retroviral therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is adopted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, a higher body mass index), cases of osteonecsis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of an antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also mediums of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir may not be used together with medicines, whose active ingredients are mainly metabolised via CYP2D6 and associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% decrease in the AUC of amniavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lowered plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with kritonavir, adverse reactions in the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Ambuavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes Johanniskraut, the amateurs mirror and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's Wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nelfinavir is administered together with Ambuavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, whereas Cmax was reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Ambuavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amniavir were used twice a day and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, confirming the efficacy and safety of this treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% abased when amrupavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma obtained with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ambuavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but close-meshed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There has been no pharmacokinetical study on the use of didanosine in combination with Didanosin, but due to the antazione component of Didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with Ambuavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amateavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may lower serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amateavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with aziase in combination with erythromycin have not been performed but the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once a day led to an increase of the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2,69k compared to the value observed after 200 mg ketacconazole once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may cause interactions when used together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines when used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it may result in resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of Ambuavir plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, dilemazem, felodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine and anapamil.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of apgenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study in which ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the Fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous dispensation of aggrazing with kritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">For HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels with simultaneous administration of Agenerase are expected.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors lead to myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this drug with Ambuavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amateavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase must not be used together with Midazolam taken with orally (see Section 4.3) while caution is required while using Agenerase with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Ambuavir, patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opipiate, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given as to how to adapt the amrupa dosage if Ambuavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Concurrent administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase is recommended for increased control of INR (International Regular Revatio) because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening anti-thrombotic effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of kritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictably, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended while grazing at the same time (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may be used only after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances have been detected in the milk of lactose-related rats, but it is not known whether Ambuavir is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, to which amrupavir was given from the evaporation into the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of the seed, including fertility and reproduction, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral therapies.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the treatment of the veins were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely lead to the treatment of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are in connection with taking Agenerase or any other medicine used for HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed at more than 1% of patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and faecal fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsal fat accumulation (spike spike).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral, non-pre-treated subjects treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 presented in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under Ambuavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 patients (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with Ambuavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of an antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of initiation of an antiretroviral therapy (ART), an anti-retroviral therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients receiving 600 mg of Agenerase twice daily along with low dose kritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of side effects (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; one exception constituted increases of triglyceride and CPK values, which received Agenerase together with low dosed kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supporting measures are to be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amateavir binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag- and gag pol- polyproteins with the result of a formation of unsurpassed, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in both acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Ambuavir is in the range from 0,012 to 0,08 µM in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Ambuavir vs. HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral and not previously untreated patients with the currently approved fossiamprenavir / ritonavir dosages - as with other kritonavir used treatment schemas with proteaseinhibitors - the mutations described have rarely been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral, not pre-treated patients who received 700mg of fossiamprenavir with 100mg ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children in which virological failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, IEC 62A / M / T / V, I54L / M / T / V, I54L / M / T / V, I82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) with protease inhibitors patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance testing, genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amediavir / knight avir or fossiamprenavir / knight avir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to fossiamprenavir with ritonavir and a decreased likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always approach the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing, clinical validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in connection with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amediavir / knight avir or fossiamprenavir / knight avir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies selling diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with reduced sensitivity to amateavir-associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross resistance against ritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fossiamprenavir resistances, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral, not previously treated patients, in which a fossiamprenavir-containing regimen failed (one of them showed a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir (three of 25 isolates), indinavir / ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and tipranavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, amprenavir reserves its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of a preventive therapy is recommended to prevent the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits which can adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with kritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study Pro30017, a randomized open trial in which PI pre-treated adults (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside alogues (NRTI) or a standard of care (standard of care, SOC) received with a PI, mainly with low-dosed kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-supremacy of APV / knight avir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-supremacy rate of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unchecked veins is based on two uncontrolled trials of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was tested three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low-dose ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) versus the initial value.</seg>

<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax, by 30%, when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amateavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimal concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of absorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of amrupavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amrupavir, which represents the active part, remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amateavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state via the range from Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines which induce or inhibit CYP3A4 respectively represent a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered cautiously if given at the same time as Agenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The administration of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, results in a similar daily intake of amprenavir as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambuavir is out of the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, so the effect of a renal dysfunction on the elimination of amrupavir and ritonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens lead to amateavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained at healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg of amrupavir twice a day without simultaneous use of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occured in male animals with doses of the 2.0-times (mice) or 3.8-times (rat) of the human exposure, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there were little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans, both from clinical studies and therapeutic applications.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in vitro and in-vitro gene toxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal cell tests on human peripheral lymphocytes, Ambuavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical use by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical studies, neither during the administration of apgenerase nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate both in the control animals and in the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly inferior (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans, a number of minor changes including thymus negation and minor skeletal changes were observed that indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are used without the enhancing additive of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amrupavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Concurrent application should be carried out with caution in patients with low or mild liver dysfunction; in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but close-meshed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amateavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amateavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2077">In a clinical study in which ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the Fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">Concurrent administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase is recommended for increased control of INR (International Regular Revatio) because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening anti-thrombotic effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmin from amrupavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occured at the exit of the urethra, some women had difficulty passing urine, which necessitated an emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The use of Imiquimod cream directly after a treatment with other cutaneous applied methods for the treatment of external genital warts in the genital and perianal area has not yet been clinical experience.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Although limited data indicate an increased rate of factual reduction in HIV positive patients, Imiquimod cream has demonstrated less efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="2195">Treatment of basal cell carcinoma with imiquimodine within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips, or hair approach was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are frequent, but the intensity of these reactions is generally decreasing during therapy or after completion of treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions, a treatment period of several days may be made.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there are currently no data on long-term treatment rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">There are no clinical experiences in patients with recurrent and previously treated BCCs, therefore the application in pre-treated tumors is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours (&gt; 7,25 cm2) there is a lower probability of response to the Imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimiodine was not studied for the treatment of actin keratoses on eyelids, in the interior of the nose or in the ears or on the lip area within the lipid.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actin keratose on the lower arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of therapy or go back after treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause the patient to cause great discomfort or are very strong, the treatment may be suspended for several days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 active lesions showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immunostimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be used with caution in patients who receive an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, fetal / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) have not been quantifiable after a single topical application, no recommendation can be made for use during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream related side effects in the studies with three-week treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the event warts (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The side effects reported by 185 with Imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial were shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse effects associated with the application of imiquimod cream in these studies were a reaction at the site of the application (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects that were given by 252 in placebo-controlled phase III clinical studies with Imiquimod cream treated patients with actin keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This evaluation of the clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies with Imiquimod cream three times weekly treatment with Imiquimodine (61%), erosion (30%), excoriation / leaves / scales (23%) and oedema (14%) came (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This assessment of the clinical signs provided according to the study protocol showed that in these studies, five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream very often resulted in severe erythema (31%), serious erosions (13%), and severe shoring and disarmament (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratose, alopecia was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The singular oral intake of 200 mg of imiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hypotony that normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">According to the topical application of Imiquimod, systemic concentrations of the alpha-interferon and other cytokines were detected in pharmacokinetic examination.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, it was shown that efficacy with regard to a complete healing of the tendencies in an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of all patients who had been treated with imiquimiod, the patients were completely cured; this was in the case of 20% of the 105 patients with placebo-treated patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimiod, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimiod in five-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies was investigated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically healed and that remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimodine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic action lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 treatment area on the uneakable scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external genital warts, actin keratose and superficial carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children between 2 and 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimodine could not be demonstrated in these studies in the dosages being studied (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actin keratose was observed in the three-week-weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest pharmaceutical concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were in the face (12,5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure data showed that the resorption of Imiquimod to the topical application on MC-diseased skin of 6-12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actin keratose or superficial BCC.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly lowered body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months for dermal application did not result in similar effects with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice in three days a week induced no tumors at the application site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimodine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for humans due to systemic exposure is considered to be very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream previously and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the reported side effects you have considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feignizen (Condylomata acuminata) formed on the skin in the genitals and anus (anus) are a common, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If left untreated, it can lead to distortions, especially in the face - therefore early detection and - treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actin keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their previous life.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied in the face and scalp of patients with a healthy immune system, where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara Cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the superficial BCC, the actin keratose or the virus responsible for the infection.</seg>

<seg id="2250">As soon as the reactions are cleared, you can continue the treatment. o Inform your doctor if they have no normal blood image</seg>
<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning is not performed under the foreskin, swelling, thinning of the skin or difficulty can be expected when the foreskin is withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not use aldara cream in the urethra, in the vagina (vagina), cervix (cervix) or within the anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medicines has serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse during the infection with genital warts in the genital area, the treatment with Aldara Cream is to perform after intercourse (not before).</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently applied it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Breastfeed infant during treatment with Aldara Cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimodine enters breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of tendencies, basal cell carcinoma and actin keratose (see specific instructions for each area of application).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of aldara cream to the clean, dry skin area with the skin warts and gently rub the cream on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with tendencies under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin each day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you have to consider prior to the use of Aldara Cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>

<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause a blue stain to occur in you, or can cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed you significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you may experience itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied Aldara Creme (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Most of the time, these are lighter skin reactions, which end up again within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, choral formation, skin disorder, bladder, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally some patients suffer from changes at the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, swollen areas in the skin, tingling, shredding, or flu-like symptoms, depression, eye irritation, swelling of the eyelids, sore throat, facial swelling, ulcers, body aches, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, complicate movements, reduced lung capacity, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyms should be monitored by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyms should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly examined the safety of the drug, but it was also measured by its effectiveness (by examining its effect with regard to reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the concentration of GAG in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement of the lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyms may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Each year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may be known and where necessary update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyms will observe patients receiving aldurazyms with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the marketing of Aldurazyms throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, derived from the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyms should be carried out by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any incidental adverse effects that occur during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyms should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment where revitalizing facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment must be cautiously performed.</seg>
<seg id="2296">To treat the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions 60 minutes before the onset of infusion with drugs (antihistamines and / or anti-pyreagents).</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of a slight or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyms should not be used at the same time with chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intraocular uptake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not imply direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, fetal / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns which have been exposed to breast milk over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during the treatment with Aldurazyms.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Side effects in clinical trials were mainly prescribed as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme observed during the phase 3 trial and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are performed in the following table: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions emerged, including bronchospasm, breathing stillness and facial oil (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted Drug Affects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe course form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients received a seroconical conversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a more severe form of seroscopy at the age of 5 (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or until a premature exit from the study), no radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) assay was detected by radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP).</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG spying in the urine, while a variable reduction of GAG in urine was determined in patients with high antibody titers.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibiting effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the treatment of enzymatic enzymes is a sufficient reestablishment of enzyme activity for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, the most likely about Mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients had a mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the anticipated value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary outcomes for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FV and absolute walking distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyms every week for 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme compared the placebo group to improve lung function and salviability presented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increases further proportionately to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of 26 patients with a HepAtomic anomaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease of the GAG-Spiegel in the urine (µg / mg of creatinin) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous group manifestation between patients treated by using a combined end point, the clinically significant change across five efficacy variables (expected percentage-normal FeV, range in the 6-minute walk, range of movement of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 trial was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study.</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- levels in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-score for this age group. the younger patients with the severe type of course (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe type of progression they were limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacocodynamic effects of different aldurazyme dosing schemes were carried out on the GAG-Spiegel in the urine, liver volume and 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available, rate annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional safety and toxicity studies, toxicity in repeated doses and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not allow any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2347">Instructions for handling - dilution and application The concentrate for the production of an infusion solution must be diluted prior to the application and is intended for the intravenous application (see information for physicians or medical specialists).</seg>
<seg id="2348">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-I- conditional involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, however, severe reactions emerged, including bronchospasm, breathing stillness and facial oils.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (occurrence at more than 1 of 10 patients): • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • skin rash • joint disease, joint pain, back pain, pain in the arms and legs • redness • fever • chills • increased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Reaction at the infusion site</seg>
<seg id="2351">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the packaging fee will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2352">If the ready-to-use preparation is not immediately used, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, provided the dilution was performed under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Preparation of the Aldurazyme Infusion (using aseptic technique) • According to the body weight of the individual patient, first determine the number of hatch bottles to be diluted.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another medicine against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (cancer treatment) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body. • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer that does not attack the squamous epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">When Aciplatin is administered together with cisplatin, a "anti-antibiotic" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (in order to prevent a lack of fluid) should be given before or after the addition of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood type changes or with which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, removed or the dose should be decreased.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of telemetric fixed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of telemetric mixed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the maligated pleuramothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">In addition, Alimta was compared to gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin averaged 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously had received chemotherapy, mean survival with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells showed longer survival in the administration of Alimta than with the comparison medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the transport of Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each flow bottle must be dissolved with a 4.2 ml 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after the completion of the pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, corticosteroids must be given the day before and during the day of the telemetric signal and the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">At least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven days before the first dose of telemetry.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week prior to the first fixed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive telemetry, a complete blood pattern should be created prior to every application, including differentiation of leukocytes and thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment course a dose examination must take place taking into consideration the Nadir of the blood type or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applied for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 hemorrhage.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 dosages a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so- in the presence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that there is an increased side effect risk in patients at 65 years of age or over 65 years of age compared to patients at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dosages recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold the upper Bilirubin- limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold the upper limit value (in the case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored and telemetry can not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophils again have a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophus number, platelet number and maximum non-haematological toxicity, as observed in previous courses of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">Less toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with telemetry must be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophy- lactic measure for reducing treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous use of nonsteroidal anti-logistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days after the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for whom a telemetric therapy is provided must avoid taking NSAIDs for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with telemetry (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in transcellular space, drainage of the effusion should be considered before the telemetric treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 primary cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with telemetry, if this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccines (except yellow fever) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible impairment of the reproductive capacity is due to telemetry, men should be advised in advance of the treatment procedure to obtain advice regarding the preservation of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal anti-logisics (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g per day) can result in reduced exposure to telemetric acid with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advised if high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid can be used in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy, avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with telemetry (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use of routers must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with telemetry.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regular Revatio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of telemetry in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Telemetry must not be used during pregnancy except if it is strictly necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible injury to the reproductive capacity is due to telemetry, men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment, to obtain advice regarding the blockage preservation.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether mixed telemetry is mixed into the breast milk and unwanted effects on the breastfed baby can not be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and randomized Cisplatin and Pemetremixed and 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2507">In the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily patches on anus, flatus (winds) with stage pass, faeces, greasy / oily stool, leaving oily secretion (rotting), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It should not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for reducing the weight of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under the age of 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, as orlistat is only minimally resorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or a fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients taking alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures in order to prevent the possible failure of the oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on the interactions of drugs and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">If warfarin or other oral anticoagulants are used in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally normally-ised ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta-carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take an additional multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of an Amiodarone single-dose dose, a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat were observed a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal-nature and are associated with the pharmacological effect of the medicine as the absorption of taken fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rarely (&lt; 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of adverse events reported after the launch of orlistat is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown sizes.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli may lead to regimens in terms of possible resp. actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal-weight and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Either side effects or similar side effects reported in the recommended dose of orlistat were reported in the majority of Orlistat overdosing reported after the market launch.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on investigations on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects that can be traced back to the inhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect lies in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-rest of the gastre and pankreatic lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg of orlistat was taken three times a day, which blocks the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in study course (Table 1) and as percentage of those participating individuals who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average dietary change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The mean waist circumference was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting point 103,7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, in therapeutic dosages, the metered orlistat in the plasma could only be sporadic and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and no signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients with minimal systemic resorbed dosage, two main metabolites, i.e. M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Formyl-Leucine Group) were identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety psychology, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not allow any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and are caused by the excretion of fat from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the beginning of the treatment, as at that time you may not have consistently reduced the fat content in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutritional deficiencies: • Begin a few days, or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and the size of the portions that you normally consume.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases. • Distribute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Almaxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong causes of nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, which are the cause of nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an anti-treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there is insufficient information on the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), which prevents receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong respectively moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 by 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate causes of nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron, 63% were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted SA Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the marketing of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in strong emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi in the prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by strong emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnestial palpation or indication of a subacute ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with simultaneous dispensing of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is extended or which tend to an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents evaluated against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single IV dose of Palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, it was shown that the simultaneous application of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, chlorpromazine, chinidine, reanitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant impact on the clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common adverse events reported in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly associated with Aloxi, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar abundances of adverse events as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-mode relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were conducted, but due to the large distribution volume a dialysis is presumably not an effective therapy for Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mcg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mcg / m2 cyclophosphamide (half-life time: 4 hours) or 100 mg / m2 dagetron (half-life equivalent to 7.3 hours) that was given intravenously on Day 1 without Dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double blind study 667 patients receiving strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared with patients given intravenously 32 mg ondansetron.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results from studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular De- and Repolarisation and prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of palonosetron administered intravenously in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Following IV administration a gradual removal of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are dosisproportionally in the entire dose range of 0.3 90 μ / kg for healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following IV administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration measured at 42 ± 34% was measured in 11 testicular carcinoma patients between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations it emerged that once daily intravenous 0,25 mg of Palonosetron was comparable to a value measured after one-time IV administration of 0.75 mg, the Cmax was higher after the one-time injection of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated via the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on the metabolism we have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as unaltered agent made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">In 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal clearance of 53 ± 29 ml / min after a single IV injection in healthy patients.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only in expositions which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies there was evidence that Palonosetron can only block Ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and reolarisation and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately the 30x of therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased incidence of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marks) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and because Aloxi is determined in humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is very low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) passed a negative report in which the approval of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that alpheum should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same medicinal ingredient already approved in the EU (also referred to as "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheum should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">A microscopic examination shows damage to the liver tissue, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormalize.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates it to the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of alpheeon presented data confirming the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (Actual structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference physician to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients were hospitalized after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood were reported).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Moreover, concerns were expressed in such a way that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed was not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheeon the disease was retreated with more patients than with the reference physician; moreover, AlpheXeon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study was not adequately validated to determine the extent to which the drug causes an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine).</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected laids (fissures or cuts), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin surface to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85,6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients in placebo addressed the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together at skin findings, about 90% of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the surface of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections outweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small lazards, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the introduction of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be taken into account (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of sensitization or serious local irritation by applying retina ointment, the treatment is canceled, the ointment is carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogens or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary uninfected open wounds the efficacy of reapamulin in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsening of the infected place occurs after a 2 to 3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on poor skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo cannot be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg Ketoconazol the average Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax of topical application of 1% retapamulin ointment on peeled skin of healthy adult men increased by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical Retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate with regard to a statement regarding the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Reapamine ointment should only be used during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of reapamulin is preferable to systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Whether breastfeeding is continued or terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated, the benefit of breastfeeding is to weigh the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which used Altargo, the most common side effect was irritation at the administered place, affecting about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effect Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic Derivat from Pleuromutilin, a substance that is obtained by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Purotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial giant which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Binding at this binding site inhibit the peptide transfer, partially block P-binding sites and prevent the normal formation of active 50-bosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retinapamulin seem questionable in at least some types of infection, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus were detected, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-compliance with S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">In a study with healthy adults, 1% retapamine ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and on lowered skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamine ointment twice a day for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples took place on days 3 or 4 in adults before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of reapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, less participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro-examination of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma-test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats-microkernel test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were no signs of limited fertility in male or female rats at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skulled skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, with a protection against hepatitis B possibly only after administration of the second dose." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunisation process, and it is ensured that the vaccination plan consisting of two doses can lead to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix may be given or another hepatitis A or B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defences of the body), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">"" "the" "" "Ambirix" "" "contains the same ingredients as the" "" "Twinrix Adult" "" "approved since 1996 and the TwinCArix vaccine approved since 1997." ""</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but TwinCArix adults and TwinCArix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults have identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the application of Twinrix adults were also used as a proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month interval and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix led a month after the final injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of Ambirix's protection was similar in six months and a 12 month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active agents, any of the other constituents or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals a permit for the transport of Ambirix all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for pridimmying with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of the election and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster is desired for both hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, the appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) are in the same order as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully ensured that immunocompetent persons who have responded to a hepatitis A vaccine will need a booster shots as protection, since they may be protected by immunological memory even if antibodies are no longer detectable.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all vaccines, the possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the injection of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the randomized vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA types of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of haematalysis patients and persons suffering from disorders of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibody-value is reached after pridimmunisation, so that in these cases the gift of additional vaccinations may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal impetus, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenia or coagulation disorders, however, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneously, as in these cases, after intramuscular administration, bleeding can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or combined with a combined massage - mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that a sufficient immune response may not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was similar to the frequency observed in earlier thiomery and preservative-containing vaccination formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines with a total of 1027 vaccines were administered at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with that of the 3-doses combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and weariness on a basis of calculation per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not based on a computational basis for each person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the application of Ambirix in 50.7% of subjects, compared to 39.1% in subjects following the dose of the 3-doses combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix reported pain in comparison to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated using the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of matchiness was however comparable per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix compared to 36.2% among the subjects who received the 3-doses combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and matchiness was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11 year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambience group was similar to that observed in administration with the 3-doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported after vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccine scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine scheme with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15, the serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99,1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose administered to the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Serotide conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose administered to the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard compound with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluated, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month of 2 and 6 after the 3-dose vaccine was administered significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were obtained in a clinical comparative study for 1 to 11 year-olds on a month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines either received a 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of priming, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to that after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study in 12- to including 15-year-olds, it could be demonstrated that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable to the 0-6 months vaccination scheme 24 months after immunization.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was administered in the second year at the same time with the booster secretion of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, azellular Pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation of adults showed similar seroprotection and serum conversion rates as for the previous formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series with 2 doses has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccines, (although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or diseased at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis A or Hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you / your child already have an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic) has shown.</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can manifest by itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you / your child already have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually scheduled administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constituents per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection before ending the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix will be injected under the skin and not into the muscle in persons suffering from severe blood clotting disorders. • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / its body's defenses, or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child can take other medicines (including those that have been vaccinated without prescription) or if you / your child have recently been vaccinated / has been given or immunoglobulins (antibodies) have / has or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as different extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Normally, Ambirix will not be given pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless it is urgently needed to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you / your child already showed an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very common (more than 1 case per 10 decayed cans): • pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mateness • irritability • headaches • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ often (up to 1 case per 10 decayed cans): • swelling at the injection site • fever (over 38 ° C) • dizziness • gastrointestinal disorders</seg>
<seg id="2799">Further side effects reported days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 distributed doses) are reported:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include spatially limited or extended strokes, which can be itchy or vesicular, swelling of the eye area and face, terrific breathing or swallowing, sudden blood pressure drop and unconsciousness.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data known since obtaining the first permit for the placing on the market, the CHMP assumed that the benefit-risk relationship for Ambirix was positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only put into circulation in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposition.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under food or administered via a gastrostomy hose (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, because ammonaps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a placebo, that is, without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidification in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or flavoring, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonaps in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevent ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved in" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "due to the rarity of the disease at the time of the approval there was limited information about this drug." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for the use if hyperammonia encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake required for the growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carbamide phosphate synthetase or ornithine, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk of esophagusulzera when the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each AMMONAPS tablet contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium bicylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency and associated with sodium retention and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium polybutyl phosphates occurs via the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">A subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased neuron loss.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed ripening of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted into the breast milk in humans, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least one adverse event (AE) occurred in 56% of the patients and at 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactative dosis, severe hypokalemia, armor topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred during a 5 month old infant with an occasional single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in an intravenous dosage of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an active compound based on acetylation with glutamine to form phenylacetylmethamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">In terms of stoichirically, phenylacetylmethamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylmethamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that polyphenylbutyrates are produced for each gram, between 0.12 and 0.15 g. of phenylacetylmethamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infected, and the disease led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium polybutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium polyphenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn in postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even with those patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Survival rate was 98% in patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Ornierter Transcarpathi-Mangels) that recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium polyphenylbutyrat and a protein reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylbutyate is known to be oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in the liver and kidneys with glutamine, and phenylacetylmethamine is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate for sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients with sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form 15 minutes after ingesting measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2846">According to different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), the majority of patients with urinary cytology or haemoglobin opathies had no phenylacetate in the plasma after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma levels were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Secretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product Phenylacetylglutamine via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrat had no lamellar effects in the case of toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granules are either orally taken orally (infants and children who can not swallow any tablets, or patients with difficulty swallowing) or by a gastrostomy or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carbamide phosphate synthetase or ornithine, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium bicylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium bicylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat-flutes were suspended before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat), there was lesions in the pyramid cells of the brain-cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactative dosis, severe hypokalemia, armor topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">In terms of stoichiometry, phenylacetylmethamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylmethamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess phosphate.</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylmethamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that polyphenylbutyrates are produced for each gram, between 0.12 and 0.15 g. of phenylacetylmethamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat measured 15 minutes after ingesting.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">The small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the drug over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium polybutyate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products which accumulate in the body after the consumption of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must notify the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS as Sodium polyphenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not take AMMONAPS, as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, obstruction of hearing, disoritibility, memory deficits and deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you forgot to take AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>

<seg id="2872">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2873">You are not allowed to use AMMONAPS after the expiry date specified on the cardboard box and the container.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Like AMMONAPS looks and content of the pack AMMONAPS tablets are of whitish color and oval form, and they are provided with the embossing "UCY 500."</seg>

<seg id="2876">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS distributed on the same single doses or via a stomach fistpan (hose which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal probe (hose which is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take from the container a heaped measuring spoon of granulate. • Apply a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess granulate. • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon. • Take the recommended number of measuring spoon granules from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of chest pain with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress uplift" (an abnormal measurement value of electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients with a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient often used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as Abciximab und Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without a gift from GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as much as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, andetox was as effective as heparin with respect to all indicators, except for severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who had a recent bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd approval for the marketing of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-raising infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in a further sequence, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed after clinical requirements for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before the procedure, a pin drop of 0.5 mg / kg is administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial IV drop of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one immediately following IV infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an allsome Bolus-application of Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second captive bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the dosage intake should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt recovery should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also with dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the completion of the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular haparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• noted hypersensitivity to the active substance or other components or against hirudine • active haemorrhages or increased risk of bleeding due to malfunctioning of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible clotting disorders. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if there are most bleeding in the arterial spot in the case of PCI patients in bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may cause bleeding during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regular Revatio) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after treatment with bivalirudin is once again reached the level pre-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the action mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocyte Units), it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with platelet units or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostaseparameters are regularly monitored in each case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental studies are insufficient in terms of pregnancy, fetal / fetal development, childbirth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomized to bivalirudine plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the bivaliddin group and in patients treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Heavy bleeding was defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleedings as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleedings were significantly less common among bivaliruines than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidine plus GPIIb / IIIHA (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY serious hemorrhage was defined as one of the following occurrences: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the area of puncture, reduction of haemoglobin from ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding order, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed hemorrhage localizations with more than 0.1% (occasional) were "other" punctuation points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with bivalidine in 6000 patients undergoing PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalirudin group and in patients treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleedings were significantly less common among bivaliruines than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects that are not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system organclasses in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose, the treatment with bivalirudin is immediately broken down and the patient is closely meshed with regard to the signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombinoinhibitor which binds both at the catalytic centre and the anion-binding region of thromboin, regardless of whether thromboin is present in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirudin to thromboin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin has slowly split the binding of bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thus regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivaliddin was unable to induce Thrombocytopenia / heparin induced thrombocytopenia / heparin induced thrombocytopenia / heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, bivalidine shows a dose of dose and concentration depending on the anticular effects caused by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following patients, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the operation should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-lift attack (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were randomised to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the onset of angiography (at the time of randomisation) or at the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography in 72 hours, were equally distributed over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic ECG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angiography.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30 day and 1 year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for patients receiving Aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography and before the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 An ACUITY serious hemorrhage was defined as one of the following occurrences: intracranial, retroperito-neale, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, reduction of haemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding order, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on fourfold and triple endpoints of a randomized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing PCI (REPLACE-2), are presented in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiabox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">Pharmacokinetic properties of bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that, as a peptide, bivalirudine enters into its amino acid constituents with subsequent revalorisation of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulted from splitting the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thromboin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, thigh or upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or to process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lisiness differs very slightly from the insulin insulin level, and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter active life than a short-acting insulin insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged four to 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with type 1 diabetes adults, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin lipped.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the decrease of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human acting insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra might have to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH an approval for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">As a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced glucose availability and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin must be reduced in patients with impairment of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of intensity, brand (heroine), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-retarded, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can change the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dose or abortion of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be performed under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of hypoglycemia depends on the effectiveness of the insulin used and can therefore change if the treatment plan is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase the blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin constricting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors, discoycin, nitrootene, propoxyphene, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the effects of sympatholytics such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethian and reserpine can be alleviated or absent from the symptoms of adrenergic counter-regulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and humanoid in relation to pregnancy, fetal / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin injections are transferred into human breast milk, but in general, insulin does not enter into the breast milk nor is it resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following, the adverse drug processes known from clinical studies are listed, grouped by system components and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremors, anxiety, unusual fatigue or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive lying, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is foamed to continuously change the injection area within the injection area, as a result a lipodystrophy may occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemics with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) administered by an appropriately trained person or by intravenous dosage of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the serious hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lissin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mellitus, insulin lens in the therapeutically relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucosal effect, and at 0.3 e / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucose-lowering effect, just like the humanoid.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lisiness has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than the humanoid.</seg>
<seg id="2996">It was evident from the data that a comparable post-postprandiale glycaemic control was achieved in an application of insulin glycaemic 2 minutes before the meal, as with a human acting insulin insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was filled 2 minutes before the meal, better postprandiale control was achieved than with a human acting insulin injectable 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If the insulin closure is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a similar glycaemic control is achieved, as with a human acting insulin insulin, which is given 2 co-nudes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin-lulisin in administration 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before beginning of meal compared to human acting insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human acting insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin injections under administration 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after beginning of the meal compared to normal normal insulin insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
