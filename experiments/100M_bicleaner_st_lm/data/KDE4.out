&quot; &quot; &quot; the module &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Website &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ quer@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu under Extras Website . select the source and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated in place of the whole &amp; URL .
automatic translation is very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and , in the worst case , non@@ sense . therefore , the translations don &apos;t make any important decisions , without checking the translation beforehand .
other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish site itself , where you can insert texts to be translated directly .
the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions .... Open the box tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that more modules may be installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on Con@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if available .
the module An@@ gle Filter ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ gle Filter . with this module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; the current working directory can be filtered in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M Tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Item , all other nodes are sub @-@ elements of this node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view of objects with the MI@@ ME content in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative to the various icon and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; it consists of graphi@@ cally representing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rectangle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then , can be easily detected if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX Â® command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap image is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color coding and labelling settings .
the color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles is to be used ( whereby display errors occur by limitations on the mark of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rectangle .
with performance algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be comp@@ lied with , that the area is propor@@ tionally related to the size of the entry . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and those boxes need space that is no longer available for subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle is square .
how distribution of the area of an entry is done for the subordin@@ ate entries is up to the implementation . here it is necessary to divide the areas so that rect@@ angles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive dup@@ lication .
you can set the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry via the menu item View stop at area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Image Gallery ... or by C@@ trl ; I .
when you open the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens , with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery .
the Tit@@ le of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option Show images per line has a sli@@ der and a rot@@ ational field to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each line in the gallery .
use the file name of the image to see if the filen@@ ames are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the check box file size of the image , you specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
view the image size check box to see if the size of the images is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the folder dialog you specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the Save In HTML file selection , enter where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set with a sli@@ der or a control panel , until which level the sub@@ folders are included .
if you want to copy the original pictures to the gallery , you will be able to copy the original pictures .
using the comment file check box , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug ; albums can download . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ code ; working together .
&amp; digi@@ code ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam , it is easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in the 16 bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion by means of li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report any problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; nbsp ; When you are in the program , the Help menu provides an entry to report problems or requests .... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined linking . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error report system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ code ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you to answer questions about other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . however , you may soon answer yourself questions from other users . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be profi@@ cient in this language .
you can also edit the digi@@ plug ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ code ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . guidance for signing up in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; edit ; for the first time , you will be asked where to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data will be saved . this path will remain the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ K@@ am setup collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; consider each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; dur@@ ingly recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders , unless it is in hidden folder . you can do this by inser@@ ting one point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have any photos as icons . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ word i@@ ste to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw @-@ mode of your camera , you can handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a specific camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ 2 and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug ; albums can download . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ code ; working together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . the camera is then used as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and are slow via the serial port , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ code ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails from digi@@ K@@ am . the Ex@@ if support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might be unable to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the nic@@ est things in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ o ; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug @-@ in Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ ge . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes came into &amp; digi@@ code ; self @-@ accompli@@ shment .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
moving and dropping pictures works anywhere : you can store a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ tree , over the horizontal partition line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields displayed in the toolbar at present . this way , the filter will only work on the filen@@ ame when this is shown in the symbol view . what fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ i &amp; quot ; provides an organized view to your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album characteristics or after the date on which the album was created first .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to select your albums to be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos when you select from the tool bar or sort albums After collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections settings .
the Night@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by sorting date .
the buttons El@@ der , average , New Year : these set the date to that of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do so , try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file in this folder is used instead .
when you first open an album in &amp; nbsp ; open , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ i &amp; quot ; This will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview &amp; quot ; As an album preview ! additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; nbsp ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My Key@@ word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a bit while the thumb@@ nails are generated , so you can avoid using the Tools menu in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be shown below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can edit via settings digi@@ plug ; set up the albums page and customize the area preview images to your wishes .
the preview images feature help windows that appear . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter rest for a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all key words of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top in the Intro@@ duction to the main window shows such an help window .
photos and keywords allow you to organize your photos in a way that suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can view all the features that come with &amp; Edit . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Picture Edi@@ ting ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... you can select a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with image editing you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ plug ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you can find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the preview and select rotation . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo from &amp; Edit , it is moved into the tr@@ ash bin by &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Picture deletion or Del case you prefer to really delete , you can do this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ der quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ code ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
tags provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be shown .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords in lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word li@@ pi@@ quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also re @-@ import your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the tags are re @-@ imported in the loss of the database as soon as &amp; digi@@ kam ; the pictures noted .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch &amp; quot ; or click on an existing cue word and then select New keyword . if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this will become the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself is not deleted . only the cue word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting Cue Sign@@ up from the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word quot ; .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the picture with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want to add with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word quot ; drag and drop it . alternatively , you can also click on the preview of the pictures with the right mouse button and select keyword instructions from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords you assigned tags . in this way you can give a cue for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear in the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Key@@ words menu . the menu only shows the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the time beam view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved through this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , simply click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame which indicates the time unit . this will display all related images in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
includes all database elements : names , app@@ rais@@ als , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more in the future .
in addition to the search box , a small lamp is the green when finding matches . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search has not found , then the lamp becomes red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box like the one described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you entered as a search criterion .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be performed . the results will be displayed in the Search list in the main window . the Text box Save search as used to change your request a name in My search list . if you want to change your selection again , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select to edit search , the search form will appear with the previously entered search information . if you select to edit Advanced search , the Advanced search dialog will appear to change your previous search . see the Advanced search tool section for more information .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete Search in the Search context menu .
advanced Search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ code ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the al@@ b database . an option can be added to this list with search group / deleted , or deleted from it . each option can be associated with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ...
&amp; digi@@ kam ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the lower the difference between two signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ erts the choice of results can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of un@@ successful search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : hands @-@ free sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the matching images . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab displays an intuitive map finder based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter , which will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides a lighting console in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add to the light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lighting console and its window will open . if you are back in the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window , you can quickly open the lighting console with L Extras illuminated table .
from the preview toolbar , you can drag and drop the pictures you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . if you want to synchron@@ ize the thumb@@ nails from the toolbar and execute z@@ oos and / or move operations on one of the images , they will also be executed with the other image .
another mode is better suited for quick sorting out of a series of images . when you navigate from the toolbar , the first two images will automatically be loaded into the pane . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in the right pane . the image to the right is displayed in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal dele@@ tions work directly from the lighting console such as F@@ 4 File Edit ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it simple to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to wave the visible area of the image , you need to click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview mode , both pictures will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the zoom sli@@ der under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode .
digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos capture , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this but not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect , and use photos . we look at downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , group , archiving , optimizing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is according to your definition data , which provides information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need to find a specific photo for a longer time without taking stock management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ code ; . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive some@@ time .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found across your location , unless you were in one year several times at the same place . if you make enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images you can print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements , e.g. version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separating file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend saving the metadata option in the Settings page of the metadata ; to activate it . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to do so &amp; digi@@ code ; provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you can now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and a rating to every photo . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos while working .
now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ized images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ code ; automatically set up the tree for you or put the images to the right place . sorting the Hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated as it tracks the sub@@ trees .
the diagram shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to in@@ scrip@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let most of your photos just see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from a distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you that this is the landing site of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming of having associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others viewing your photos , the title might be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the power only to work with a let@@ tering for itself alone .
with &amp; Edit , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alised liter@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even gives you a sp@@ elling test . if you export your images to web galleries , then these labels will not tell you a second time for the let@@ tering and / or title of the web gal@@ ery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not Earth a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? good , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already moving with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ olo@@ cation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will become deeper in the future . I am sure that some@@ day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels by using images with geographic data . this then shows the photos at the location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with Google Maps Viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n of copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies . same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information was included in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ plug ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photograph , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s name , for example to protect the photographer &apos;s name . after this value has been stored once , it should not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job description . examples of this may be title such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the authors and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or modify this , in the picture embedded metadata . for individuals , this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ code ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : disk failure , disk failure , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , distributed super@@ sti@@ tion
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can also happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . this section concerns problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated carefully and you can no longer trust you for more than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers over Gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good discs and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones , but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if they have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection , they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to work miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from corrupted disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and therefore almost 6 times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB .
you should also read the media with a description , date &amp; author , and store it in a clean , dark dry and shel@@ tered spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks : dis@@ kette study
short : disks hold the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 Â° C to 45 Â° C. The most common error reason is that S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common error reason . S@@ MA@@ RT determines the im@@ min@@ ent failure . some of S@@ MA@@ RT &apos;s errors are especially reading errors and publishers . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the total loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems .
while most electric devices do not make a lot of power sur@@ ges , this can cause serious damage on devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe damage . thus , protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a portion of the energy heat and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . remember , however , that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage can use any cable to your computer , you should make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are protected as well . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a wear@@ able over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a few seconds failure can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow them to even continue working until the current is running again . if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with electricity disturbances with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected .
Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB of cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1@@ GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should only be checked in reality .
from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transfer errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage . thus , they are disaster @-@ safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem must at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these failures remain un@@ discovered until one day you have to open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one ever seems to have thought about it . no one ever seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors are un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard ( GP@@ L ) . we can only hope that it is available for &amp; Linux and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms that Z@@ FS used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the loss of data on not@@ ebooks and 46 % in work@@ station systems . for not@@ ebooks , the percentage of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long since been no longer spotted .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the broad@@ est file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : incorrect , theft and human error are the major causes of data loss .
digital cameras sensors are 1 @-@ 2 stops from fundamental physical borders . this means that while the technology is evolving there is a natural limit to this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make no one responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss . thus , backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a bolt of lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment .
disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget about aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole space or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbouring house , into your office or the like .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite f@@ use the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time at which such a backup has been made . this backup comes closest to a version@@ ing system with the exception that it is only scanned and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfers , r@@ sync copies only the difference between files that have really been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , retain associated X@@ MP files , retain original memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ discover images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
so precious images will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noted :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate all the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the print mark for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means enlar@@ ging .
let &apos;s assume you have built the scal@@ ability with you and want to zoom in the area you want to zoom to a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been detected by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; # functions with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 #
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can use g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for enhanced color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TIFF is widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed format or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ l@@ ates ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open @-@ frame image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the needs of the TIFF / EP format and comm@@ its to use metadata . D@@ NG is already available and we hope that the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon will use it some@@ time .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive a copy of your photo , mostly in the raw format , because it can store the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when connecting the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above the raw format is old . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edit , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
you can use external programs for fine @-@ lay@@ ered processing . if you edit the images again with &amp; Edit then you should add the metadata again . these were sometimes truncated by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , code to m@@ peg , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edited ; see Adding a Photos to an Album to find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect them to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . with some cameras , it may take a while . if the connection is made , a finished -@@ indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . the properties and metadata from the camera interface allow you to see the properties of an entry and its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata Editor displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s note , GPS , etc . this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; Edit ; or the image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of all . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired ones using the standard selection methods by &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected will be gra@@ yed out until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded until now . in this case , the new images are selected with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new images will be downloaded .
if you are using all the download buttons or download selected folders , a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums in section My Albums tab . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the photos you want , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once , by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete Del@@ ete button . if you just want to delete some , you must select them first and then delete selected delete .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . the photos will not be moved to the tr@@ ash bin by &amp; k@@ de ; they should be carefully checked , before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
cameras use often not particularly meaningful names for the photos . the file names are normally used again after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate files if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically each day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options that will be executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two will affect the author &apos;s data in the section Standard Car Identi@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . turn on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments , you should read str@@ f@@ time using the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera filen@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case , or upper@@ case if you prefer .
the new file name , which &amp; Edit , is used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; nbsp ; You can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point recording to perform an automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , you let &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in its original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available &amp; edited ; this is used to automatically download sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually turned off and then saved &amp; edited ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to their camera is the Download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , you ask &amp; digi@@ plug ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser to indicate the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; edited ; users who want to locate a postcard , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ el@@ ites and map references . the question is actually more about how the data enter these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and picture files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical classification ( manual ) and last via manual input of known locations .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical classification .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script , which works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool from Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the signs with hair@@ y coordinates created , for example , by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ code ; tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that modify the behavior of &amp; Edit . to access these settings , you need to set up in the Settings menu ; set up . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left .
select Action can be displayed on Embedded preview or start image processing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; Edit when you click on an entry in the main screen .
this page contains , as shown below , the identity and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s job title . this can be labels like photographer , freelance photographer or independent professional photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to indicate the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture of others &amp; quot ; offering quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field@@ set . this ensures that metadata is permanently contained in the image , and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ code ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported and imported without getting lost .
save image identi@@ fications as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the labels embedded in the pictures . note : in pictures that already contain cap@@ tions , they will be over@@ written by the Edit .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window above a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ code ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ code ; attempts , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page to the default values . each time you open the lighting console , these settings will be switched on . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation .
with the PNG @-@ compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , since PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression .
with the TIFF @-@ Files option you can activate the default image compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality as the Def@@ l@@ ates algorithm works without any loss .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not been supported yet , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; Edi@@ ting , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is quickly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image processing settings .
the default assumption is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels of odd rows , this difference creates a grid pattern in output . this option marks the picture a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ NC or A@@ HD quality method .
if set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if white balance is not set . standard it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the peak lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the peak lights , so the parts of your images that are burned out , due to the inability of your camera to look at the pointed lights , as a continuous white . use this setting to resolve some unusual results , as it displays the pointed lights in various rose tones . la@@ stly , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of missing information from the val@@ ori@@ sts .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be adapted individually for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; nbsp ; -@@ image processing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ unch small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which a matrix of coloured pixels is available . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ code ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ated Direc@@ ted ) created the quality for me and the paper used by me . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color gra@@ ding since you are done during the rough conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to return it . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information from a color space to translate into the other are the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Questions when a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files start .
color Profile folder Sets the folder here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; examine this folder during startup .
settings of ICC Pro@@ files You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; to deposit for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colored not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have a color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not fix for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depths . this means that you do not have to do the color mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that allows you to em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print a picture because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could manually correct you instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for . unfortunately not on the models of Canon . therefore here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for Land@@ sc@@ apes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface &amp; digi@@ code ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; Edit . these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu in the Settings menu .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the image display mode . underneath are the port settings . currently there are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field will only be active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / s , where you hang your camera .
to use your digital camera , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; Edit ; the camera automatically recognizes . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the Camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them all here .
with the option Con@@ fir@@ mation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the tr@@ ash@@ can you can adjust the read@@ ability of &amp; digi@@ code ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find further details in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be used sil@@ ently by &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any call@@ backs . otherwise you need to save the changes using the button Chan@@ ges .
you can also edit the display of the Welcome screen from &amp; Edit , stopping at startup . this may , in some cases , accelerate the start @-@ up of &amp; Edit ; .
the setting At start after new photos is for@@ cing &amp; digi@@ kam to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; nbsp ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , &amp; nbsp ; you know if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; nbsp ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ code ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting the Ad / Edi@@ ting item .
image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ code ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting up the image processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the filen@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below it toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
you may need to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using Rec@@ over from the File menu or using the button The Rest@@ ore the Image Processing Rest@@ ore in the toolbar . you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving .
almost every image processing action can be und@@ one or restored . you can und@@ o the last action by restoring or restoring back and / or restoring back from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the return button or Rest@@ ore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you C@@ trl , mouse wheel , or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen Saver displays the picture in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can change this in the Settings dialog from &amp; Edit . this can be changed from the Edit menu . see the section to set up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select Print image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . entire image sni@@ pp@@ ets can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the default methods and select Export job super@@ visor from the Album Export menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; nbsp ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation files , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge again .
in the label view , you can enter or insert let@@ tering with unlimited size . note that the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should follow these limitations .
once you have commented on it , either use the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , then the labels will be saved .
besides the Application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting which is always written in the images .
the evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the Re@@ gency IP@@ TC field , following the scheme in the following table :
the keyword overview shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree , and a cho@@ oser box with previously used keywords .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check@@ boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC array keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only apply to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to add a sample with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the Key@@ word filter page is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all generated keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main screen to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and filed there . a dialogue asks whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Differ@@ ent .
if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group button . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable vari@@ ance from the actual photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes to color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results they want . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( for more information see below )
your only other image editions are via e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another colour space and thus have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to sound my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you have to sound your monitor , since s@@ RGB is flas@@ hing on s@@ RGB . if you &apos;re working in s@@ RGB color space , you must either sound your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before attempting to manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Comp@@ ensation and Con@@ trast enlarge from the Cor@@ rec@@ line Automatic correction menu try automatically to make the most of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed out .
comparison : this method adju@@ sts the intensity factor of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . it sometimes produces very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic compensation : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects dark and bright borders and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
extend contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ be of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited because there is a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which operates in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will fall better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . previ@@ ewing will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel in this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the top right there is a hist@@ ogram that is changed dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether any of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your results depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment lets you improve or down the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then click anywhere on the image preview to use the color chosen for calculation of the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values will also be set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons make this exactly . any setting of the white balance you have set allows you to store it in a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button rever@@ ts all the filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture as your original . if you save these settings , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding also needs more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide to use color profiles lets you consult the chapter color management .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to use them for multiple photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner will always make the same mistake and therefore you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under Col@@ ors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; nbsp ; tool color effects provides four color effects , a solar radiation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar pol@@ arization , also called sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that emerged when one exposed a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and subsequently inver@@ ted the development of the image . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light . the result was a partial ne@@ gation of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar pol@@ arization . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further boost finally creates a negative image that is not produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ire &quot; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a colour film which is optimized in daylight by Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are too much for some photographers , especially those who do not agree with landscapes .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos . you can look at the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you only need the range of the sli@@ ders for the application purpose described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into them and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and make sure the picture changes .
the original and preview of the image can be viewed on the right . the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . on the left side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controllers : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three color pins can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and Load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and later loaded again , using Gim@@ p Levels format .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , remedies and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option Ãber@@ Char@@ ge indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
the left side shows half of the original and the target image . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark@@ er output tones and that the corresponding image pixels are dark@@ er .
a red marker is visible on the preview of the original photo . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line appears on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all the channels of shadow , mid@@ - and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ ers of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color h@@ ue of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer of Image Processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own tab .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : red , green and construction controls allow you to mix these channels . if you want to retain lumin@@ ance , the picture will retain the general brightness as well , as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space . tin@@ ting consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colour space first .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option Ãber@@ Char@@ ge indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original picture can be seen under ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic light effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) rotary filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ th@@ aton : produces warm and medium tones as it adds a bit of col@@ dness in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and the re @-@ development in a se@@ ep@@ at@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the Edit Tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to one image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shifting this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief model has been set to 200 .
with the Edit Tool@@ box , a decorative frame can be added to an image .
keeping the eye of a spect@@ ator in the bo@@ unds of a photograph is not an easy task . it is a possibility to keep his attention . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under the picture frame the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture . continuous surround the picture with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , k@@ ant@@ et surrounds it with a nice 3 dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adding a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the finish image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool Accor@@ ding to aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture at any position . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply choose a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the Edit Tool@@ kit you can put a template over a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu used in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and use maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; sten@@ cil data base , just send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam , mailing list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ folder with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder where you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be marked for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil . selecting a folder automatically refres@@ hes the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge This button magni@@ fies the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button shr@@ inks the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the entire image , you have to res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the image and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other fields .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates gra@@ iny images , especially in dark areas .
blur@@ fe mask works on the contrast of the edges to make an image shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright of Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting .
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn means that sharp edges become a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format , on the other hand , have to be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a field of sharp@@ ness during reading the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing work@@ piece . you can use the menu entry to invo@@ ke Cor@@ rec@@ t Archi@@ ving .
however , you should handle this carefully as the results do not work very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than shar@@ pen it . use the tool for sof@@ tness with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the Un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter is a very good tool to remove lo@@ op@@ ers from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview will help to edit the image . the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount intensi@@ fies the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats will produce close to sharp edges .
the radius indicates how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore , they should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . this sets the percentage of focus .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference @-@ amount . thus , one can define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore f@@ law mistakes in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red is applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted design filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing pictures is using a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focus achieves usually better results than blur@@ red mas@@ king . you can start it from the menu by using colors re@@ focus in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ Ã &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ Ã &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ les that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ Ã &apos;s folding is actually very strongly influenced by the distant pixels , causing undesi@@ rable results .
circular Shar@@ pe : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very blur@@ red then pay attention to hal@@ o@@ ons .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0,5 and the values are equal to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can take values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ Ã &apos; edge . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur is Gau@@ Ã &apos; . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or noise filter .
die size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular hot or the Gau@@ Ã &apos; edge . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter that you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all trimm@@ ing , color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much surgery changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never have the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color picture that has to be corrected . this image has been made using an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods for the sharpen@@ ing of digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the sli@@ der smooth@@ es the bl@@ ur of the area of the dark@@ ened area in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows for an adapted colour for the pupils . if you want blue eyes rather than dark ones , you can adjust this here .
tool error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ sert algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more smoothly , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to uniform fl@@ atten@@ s over the picture . whereas larger values mainly smo@@ o@@ the homogeneous regions and let details be sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary .
directional dependen@@ cy alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , whereas a value close to 1 can only be smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ arity or CCD sound , a high value will produce wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value close to 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . set this value matching to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ bar effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is run . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient here .
angle step @-@ width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be selected as small . make sure that small angles generate a long runtime . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value below 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more in quality you receive by selecting this option is only low . however , it dou@@ bles the duration . we therefore recommend it to be om@@ itted .
the Save As and Load buttons make this . correc@@ ting any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very quick at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Ab@@ ort .
below you can see how image errors are corrected using small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a bad film deposit during the trip . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned pictures from books or magazines .
if you need further information on sensor noise of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings .
the radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the range specified by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus minor bugs fixed .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to determine light density changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer be maintained and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise cannot be removed or rough@@ nesses can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ era of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas that are typically more ru@@ ff@@ led . however , it also al@@ loc@@ ates the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius will react to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter appear at the edges .
store and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen an image . use tool for sof@@ tness with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with the smo@@ othing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ Ã &apos;s noise , film grain , scratches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ sed pictures .
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Load buttons make this exactly . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very quick at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button termin@@ ating .
below you can reduce like a photo with uni@@ formity noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ i camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures are reduced to an old color photo that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts created by scanner back@@ light and photo paper . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ spots to be removed from photos taken with a CCD camera gem . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel &amp; quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark photo extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the button dark@@ er . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to connect the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard shows the last dark picture and will automatically load this in the next session .
the image area and the preview will help you correct the result inside the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic corners ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image can be seen in ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not uni@@ form@@ ly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead , they vig@@ net@@ ting them the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 with aperture filter , which may increase the necessary sh@@ utter speed in such a way that it is impossible to keep the camera manually . wide angle lenses should also use center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise un@@ shar@@ per effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s felt and color or gray scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a Center@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a Center@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controls you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density in the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates for an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ ous intensity of the pixels . you need to read@@ just the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a more subtle re @-@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a correction and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool .
the digi@@ plug ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion second gra@@ des . with negative values , t@@ onal distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most l@@ enti@@ ls , the &apos; Corner parameter has the in@@ verse character of the General parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size and thereby correc@@ ts a correction of the first gra@@ des . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
brigh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the Pre@@ view dialog displays the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the sound or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed prior to any cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as first . if you want to re @-@ cut an image and then perform a sound @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the fal@@ si@@ fication .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal aid line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea border or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ ing / cushion distortion with the help of lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black edges . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Edit Settings menu or from the Zoom Control dialog of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the tone @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture can be seen under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red movie of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is reachable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters for movie gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option F@@ ame film grains if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regul@@ ators change the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter mixes color channels for re@@ producing infrared films , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind au@@ ra in the peak lights .
this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies the manufacturers mix large silver bas@@ kets of photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ gra@@ ined effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image acqu@@ ires a timeless atmosphere loose from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value , although frequently higher values are required , is set to ISO 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter more than once .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; nbsp ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&amp; nbsp ; This oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . smo@@ othing checks the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the working is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide picture is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
the digi@@ plug ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sketch . the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . pictures whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob adju@@ sts the pin size and the lower knob adju@@ sts the contrast ( smo@@ othing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ plug ; filter engraving patterns your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distor@@ tions effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed through blocks of glass .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the picture here is distorted with another version of blocks of glass .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button termin@@ ating .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Infin@@ ity : blur@@ ring the image along star@@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : taken from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tness : blur@@ ring the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness @-@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image by means of a random shift of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent sharp@@ ness : finds the color p@@ add@@ ling in the picture and blur@@ ring it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it , by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the termin@@ ating button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of the drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing to keep an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p , the area will remain free from rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the correct orientation by mirrors or turning . the tools can be found in the Edit Rot@@ or or Trans@@ forming mirrors menu .
infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image if the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the size change tool . select to change the size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
keep aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ bar effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . enlar@@ ging each image for Photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
infl@@ ating photo is very fast in what it does , but it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the termin@@ ating button .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to twice the size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear magni@@ fication for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . image processing allows this very easy . to trim a photo you just need to create the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rectangle , you will then see this rectangle while moving the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut out . this will give you a good overview of how your photo will look after cro@@ pping . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging on the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle will be created by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting button of image editing on the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the save file save or save file from the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview pane you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog remains intact .
depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
the tool Accor@@ ding to aspect ratio is used a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
the tool Accor@@ ding to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizon@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are saved as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the placement aid settings allow you to show help in order to better put together your pictures . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonious spl@@ its are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ leg rule , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonic tri@@ angles on the diagonal .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden divide is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden divide at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden centre . a composition which follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious .
the golden centre provides more liquid aid lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you good results to your goal for your photos . in comparison to third @-@ level rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition results in the gaze of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way .
another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye may be in the center of the composition . it can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spir@@ als discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynam@@ ical symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition which you cannot achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirrors and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tioning .
with the button Color you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it easily happens that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture where things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; Edit ; image processing and tool free rotation . choose Trans@@ forming Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degrees again . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse into the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
once you have turned a picture you will find undesi@@ red tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ forming cro@@ pping from image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the Automati@@ cally cut function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . however , keep in mind the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new Hei@@ ght : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations create twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image with transforming dis@@ section from the image processing .
the locking tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . for example , the upper part of the image is shifted to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a right angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
she@@ ar your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are set to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane .
move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two lines generating twice as much wi@@ ping and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming dis@@ section from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ code ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the formats available are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , of the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; digi@@ code .
because of this dependen@@ cy from other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of all file formats available on its system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that you know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can edit the file in the image editing . you can change this list of file extensions , and change it . in the configuration section , you will find more information about this .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also store loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF to the Image Converter by &amp; Edit . in the Configuration section , you can find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ code ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . hereby more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that are edited by &amp; Edit :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ code ; the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to start playback .

if you swa@@ p steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments with the white balance module .
many tools you need to do the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ code ; your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft marks , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture applied &amp; quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area .
horizontally divided without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper part shows the original and the lower one compar@@ es the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in preview and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the Properties page displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab displays an intuitive map finder based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse folders for files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the Pal@@ let view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the Pal@@ let view . here , too , the color name can be changed .
to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is enabled under the Color Panel color , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is inserted either or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ write .
a selection created in this way as described in the last section can be used along with the actions of copy , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for clip@@ board data : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a new@@ line character , followed by a line ending character if another color follows .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program used to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s ; graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are out@@ dated &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ net@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph . die &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph@@ ene is rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated and in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these nodes )
other required software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools &amp; dot ; for representation of graph@@ s . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in a separate sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ net@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as shown in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the File icon and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the Open dialog .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or choose this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum size reduction of a graph .
if the file currently loaded in &amp; k@@ net@@ viewer ; loaded file has been changed from another program , the following window appears :
you can choose whether to re@@ charge the graph or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ net@@ viewer ; you can also note your decision , so that later it will also process . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graphic viewer ; set ... , see also .
when you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; -@@ instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but this can also be changed with the setup dialog .
at the start of the program you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save and change it later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on one page will be cli@@ cked on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph@@ s distributed over several pages without header and with a different font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Upload page gives you the option to set the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore changes ) or ask the program every time .
the Open page gives the option to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that every time it is asked .
the session administration page gives you the possibility to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session ) or decide to be asked for each start .
the context menu that usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n opens up additional options :
here you can choose among different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries described on the webpage of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graph . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graph@@ s of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the fruit @-@ man @-@ pure gold @-@ he@@ ur@@ istic , and includes a multi @-@ grid cataly@@ st for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the nodes in a circular way according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and the calculated layout of the graph will output to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms to change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of the graph ( directed or un@@ executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ rounded graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
display the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . with this mouse poin@@ ter , click on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get further help for this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the base folder of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ net@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; tools for representation . it needs the following program packages :

the K@@ IP@@ I module includes tools to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item images , a dialog appears that allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by changing the default setting of your own to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image with the button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner .
make sure the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have cli@@ cked the button , you will have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target image appears . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected import / screen shot in the menu . a window appears where you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have read the complete Desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made the dialog box appears with the options described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Calendar has no documentation currently . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
this module archives your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can simply select the albums to archive . an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation . also , the Aut@@ op@@ lay option is available for Windows platforms .
K@@ IP@@ I modules expand the program in which you are loaded to add additional functions . you can integrate additional menus , keyboard short@@ cuts and other capabilities into the program . you can install as many modules as you want within the calling program .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send his photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos in the world , place photos of your camera shop online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload pictures from your computer to Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . therefore , it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r module is launched for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog which displays the current permissions that the module displays . to upload , you need write permissions . the module currently does not support other permissions . you will be asked if you want to proceed with these permissions .
the button Add Photos should be pressed once you have placed all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server starts .
the keywords Field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the permissions on your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the option to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed in size before up@@ loading . the size is taken from the value added to maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation currently . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally within the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call up the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears . to make a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data recorded at the same time at the same locations as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
the adjustment for the maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region and magni@@ fy it again and again until you have reached sufficient accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to mount the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Image Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the char@@ set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization .
the panel has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the panel selection allows you to select all albums that are exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the album preview and the text appearing in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page opens in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; D@@ exter@@ ity show , displayed
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG image format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with Other color depth , which naturally also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the Ri@@ der preview pictures allow you to customize some of the settings from the album Ri@@ der for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will be automatically started to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown as default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows for the actions below to save images in JPEG format without the usual loss of quality and metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client module is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation currently . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the Metad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please take a look at ex@@ i@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG encoding module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV encoder .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can choose a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD Player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can launch the module using Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be chosen from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to playback the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . the name and path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG output file . if so , keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start coding the production of the movie with the knob code . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly drink a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back .
if a critic appears that coding or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the Settings button below .
the printer wizard allows printing several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened using image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . key parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amp can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image afterwards .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the filen@@ ame stays the same and only the extension will be modified accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TIFF , retains all information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise continue to use them otherwise , you shouldn &apos;t select the JPEG format , because it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing at a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images on an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images in a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can res@@ ize or enlarge the image . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : no proportional scale change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre@@ press : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent previously .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . by adding pictures you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , you will see a preview on the right .
you can also drag and drop pictures to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent .
with the Del@@ ete button , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only need to add the addresses and the subject here . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments .
be careful not to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to send . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the pictures are put together into a text file and added to the mail .
the PNG format under the Pictures File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in images of file format and the original JPEG files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . by closing the button , you can close this window .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window will appear with questions about how to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL output option in the presentation uses very elegant image transitions with Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
show the filen@@ ame option for displaying the filen@@ ame of the images in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the Loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c .
the option Show pictures random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
the distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance will depend on your computer and the chosen transitional effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random sel@@ ects another effect at every transition between images .
during the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left corner of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar , you can stop and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and next picture and stop slide show .
at the lower edge of the screen you can see the current filen@@ ame , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation currently . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Browse through these pictures , see the picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , there are now entries in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to view the current preview images . in the following , each is described for each other .
when you press the mouse with the mouse , the view of the browser will change . see the picture .
when you select another person only the images are displayed on which both persons are visible . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can display with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of action .
in the picture every person has the same icon in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however for each person to save his own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to locations , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture below .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
you must , however , specify which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you have to select the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the respective person in the context menu . here you can customize the image for the respective person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your preferences and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you access the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties . this dialog can be viewed again in the image .
if you enter a string in the let@@ tering or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . click here for pictures depicting Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for the photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the Home &amp; Photo Album &apos;s Homepage ; and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; Photo Album ; and in the first dialog select the demo if you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time , or select the menu item c@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ demo in the menu . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of the photo@@ album ; try it out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the Homepage of &amp; Photo Album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database .
the time line can show you several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ est@@ amps . if you select an area , in the preview view only pictures of this time period will be displayed . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; Photo Album ; provides two ways to create html web pages with your pictures . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the one is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can access via the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the title and a description to include the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you will see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created on the overview page . more information about the export files can be found in .
la@@ stly , you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why it is not specifically discussed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . this allows those who view your web page and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images that have , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so he can search your images with a low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if he wants to get an image bigger he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
the best way to select a basic folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the root folder where all your images are stored . this folder is stored and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start after the pages are created . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you create are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . in order for the import function , see , correctly you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that are just described have all three related to base folders and URLs . in these folders , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; Photo Album ; coming together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to go with &amp; Photo Album ; this work will not make even more .
with &amp; Photo Album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if only a link to pictures is stored in the file . the advantage of saving all pictures into the file is that you have all pictures together and that this file can be passed so independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Ex@@ porting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following is the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can view through the File Ex@@ porting menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
with the manual copy option to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; col@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is Maximum image size limit . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image is at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... select the &amp; Photo Album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wizard to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the im@@ porting images should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is in your database . therefore , in the third dialog box you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported should be imported and which categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : when you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you want to see pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and viewing , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your images , but it has been extended and today it will also take care of your videos . in many places in this manual you will talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; Photo Album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; Photo Album ; mem@@ ori@@ ze the folder where your images are stored and automatically use it in future Star@@ ts . if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start with the -@@ c option . for example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu item Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; Photo Album ; in the following section of the User Manual the different settings are explained .
on the left , you will see six different icons that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be activated by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it has been described to you how to set different properties for each picture , for example people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
click on the dialog which is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and icon .
in the Options section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , rather than all groups of a member as explained in .
see the settings options available to you for setting the member groups . with the drop @-@ down list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window you can find a list of the current categories and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; Photo Album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ preview . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plug @-@ in Interface . more information can be found on the website of Ki@@ pi .
modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; they are not part of &amp; Photo Album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are shared by multiple applications among themselves , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; Photo Album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using this on your own pictures . demo database can be used either through the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications record their images in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order for some modules the order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; Photo Album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , i.e. all the images that show you the picture show at the moment .
in addition to the current album &amp; photo album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums .
when &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry in this category is an album for the module .
or it will use the category that you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category persons , you will do this , so do so , so if you have selected persons to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; Photo Album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select which modules should be loaded in the module section .
on the picture you see an example of a start screen when you start &amp; Photo Album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and toolbar at the top . under the toolbar , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , it does not contain a lot of information , as you do not yet have information about your images .
one of the main functions of the photo@@ album is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate every picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture , where the picture has been taken , etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text field by setting up people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; Photo Album ; as you will always use them again whenever you type information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are m@@ apped , you can , by moving the names used up , find the persons faster and arrange them .
if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the Sor@@ ting icon after date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each image separately , you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the upper right .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
in the image you see a browser window showing the USA as a hyper@@ group . to show you that it is a hyper@@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the comment dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it a sub@@ category of this item . note , this assumes you are sorting exactly your categories in alphabetical order .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and dra@@ gging the bar to form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside of the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which , among other things , offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide the window . see this process in the picture .
if you select the image view in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have a filter . for example , see here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply pressing the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on an image , it will appear in the image viewer . if you do not open a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the delete button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window appears that you can see in the picture .
&amp; Photo Album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely images also without you saved on the hard disk . of course you have to have the pictures stored somewhere to make &amp; photo album ; you can see the view of &amp; Photo Album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view these images as well . however , you cannot view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy them back again . &amp; Photo Album ; does not yet support you to ask for the insertion of the respective CD . so if you want to avoid anger , such as mess@@ ing up your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the pictures menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the images in such a way that at the end those you want to disable for others , and click Ac@@ tual View lock in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the images that your little sister may see and block the menu item All except the current view .
this allows you to set which images to be hidden in case of the case . if you want to put the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item images to lock , whereby all the images you have locked will fade out . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click Lo@@ cking .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Change Password in the Privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this kind of password protection only serves to den@@ a@@ vert the view of private pictures .
the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; Photo Album ; manage and spend hours about hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; Photo Album ; over an image _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . he shows , of course , the image , but additional all the information you have entered via the image , such as who is on the image , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will show you matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you load multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the Picture High and Picture function . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a slide show . &amp; Photo Album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image can load can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; Photo Album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can zoom in and out into the image . with the mouse button you can pull a rectangle with the mouse . with the minus button you can zoom out again . the Plus button zo@@ oms in in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and displays the result of the zoom .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the uni@@ formity key uses the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are disabled and zoom in and out .
the screen@@ shot from the context menu allows you to rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu .
when you look at pictures it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can cancel the image and open configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you may prefer to only select the image and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while watching one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer has the possibility to provide images with features while watching them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the corresponding letter . in this picture you see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , they are available in your browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print , or whatever you have selected , then simply place them all at once with notes . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you display categories in a thumb@@ nail view then you can add features to the images by simply press the letter for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you allow you to paint photo album ; on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your painted later .
in order to turn on the painting mode of &amp; Photo Album ; to turn on the painting mode from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you should have read and understood absolutely .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire frame views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu appears , so that you can choose the right position :
delete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or disc@@ ard the changes with abor@@ tion .
when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object by means of help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the properties view .
press Pre@@ view in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default the entire texture is rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a point of view as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also save multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below an existing view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle will display the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the Beg@@ gar in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are ho@@ vering views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the Beg@@ gar to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the beginning bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the beginning bar . to prevent closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any position .
the current window view can be saved with View Window order ... Save . a dialog will appear where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 is current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering icon The icon Ren@@ dering in the toolbar or select the Ren@@ dering Procedure menu .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a fast preview up to full images of the highest quality .
when you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in View R@@ ender modes ... the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you see the features of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image detail for rendering to the input fields .
in the Quality combination field you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render characteristics can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
when a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ Ã¨ pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling refers to neighboring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because every pixel is split up and adapted again and again because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray uses a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are followed individually and checked for further sub@@ division . you can adjust the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for the display of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the Import menu item ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the properties view opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User documentation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type number plate .
you can set the object catch of the points onto the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you cross High level of attention for extended projections , all wire models views will be further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this property results in a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you tick the floor , a bottom is rendered under the objects . the bottom is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you tick the edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used to render the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . in more detail about the parameters , see the R@@ ender modes section .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the Window Panels section it explains how to create and store window orders .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation box Standard window arrangement : displays all existing window classi@@ fications . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the Add Window Panels show all existing window configurations . a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement using the Remove button .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button .
the position of the new window . new column opens a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a map card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should follow these warnings carefully before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should follow these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and existing icons of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and icons now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
to follow this tutorial , first you have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit Del@@ ete . then you have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which you can find the different parameters of the camera . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see more details .
do not change anything in the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when using the Apply button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert End@@ ress Body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look closely at the object tree , you will find that you can un@@ fold the item for the floor by clicking on the + before the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the horizon a unit under the horizon line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select translation and set the values as below :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens , in which you can select how to insert the object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material , because you have to type settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with one click on the preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then click the Pre@@ view button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you want to render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
each time , select the color in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should be done simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the ball can be just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or button Apply ) , so the ball will float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down .
of course , rendering now gives a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , set a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign it a material . as with the ground , give the ball a pigment as color :
select First sub @-@ object and change the name for example in ball pigment . click on Ball Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as below :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press Enter .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces even if Met@@ alli@@ c : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you model@@ ed for you . hopefully , you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer is shooting hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through every pixel in the scene . the render comp@@ utes the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene you want to be rendered needs some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest item in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last und@@ o command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit back@@ end .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ ride an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to set pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog for the creation of tool@@ bars . with this option you can add tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis , by applying a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the image size or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; it is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with the click of the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a suitable file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog Set@@ ting up &amp; ku@@ ter@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts for each window can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show , already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slideshow .
with this option save &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when you finish the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , also here the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; ku@@ ter@@ show ; set up only some of the file types that the program can display .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field , or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is interrupted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field , or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different modes of activity of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; also closed when no browser window is open .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ shot ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes his part to at least issues and potential improvements .
&amp; show@@ shot ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . whenever you are in the program , the menu displays a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page for reporting problems and wishes . all required information is already filled in , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of the show@@ shot ; if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ shot ; you can ask here questions to other users of the show@@ shot ; however , you may soon answer yourself questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ shot ; to participate , it &apos;s the developer mailing list join . instruction to join the developers mailing list from &amp; show@@ shot ; .
&amp; show@@ shot ; tries to give you as much control over his work sequences as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of the show@@ shot ; select setting . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should be the colors with what you want to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show@@ shot ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes to scan and store images .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes to scan and save images . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving for each image , or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite , using the command ch@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly handle these options .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a scan scan , then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you select a preview in the settings before saving , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if Save is pressed , then the image will be saved and deleted ? en returns to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the way you want to save and save images . open dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a filen@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved when saving without asking for a filen@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as the default for the Save dialog . the default is your home directory and you can change this using the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you do not select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; Help manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; the Settings button displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window and select Global keyboard short@@ cuts ... Select the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ specific keyboard short@@ cuts you can set by right @-@ click in the player window and select short@@ cuts ... Select .
you may set up any existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands . by doing so you make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most of which are also found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; Amar@@ ok also has some of its own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . to do so , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ ces the script to display the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored .
track@@ Change Shows that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece may be retri@@ eved ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ tit@@ le controls the path to the selected files in the playlist , when a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to remove the menu one can use the d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry , use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. clearing work . this includes , for example , saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Er@@ ku@@ ok@@ script extension . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file permissions :
when your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page by &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re just looking for a certain item of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Coll@@ ecting Browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some play@@ lists but can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . these and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player .
usually you have to enter the following in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used if you don &apos;t have any problems when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , it has some options to enable or disable the compile @-@ time point using the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the comp@@ iler options certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . see the System Requirements section for details .
activ@@ ates debu@@ gging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort across the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several box cards to set up the various features of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
show the player window in addition to the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window is displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . option switches to the experimental function of the tun@@ er bar@@ ometer .
create atmospheric settings : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the tun@@ er bar@@ ometer .
store mood files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to start when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , automatically saves the current playlist when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; check this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist while you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep the current piece visible when changing the parts causes the playlist window to roll up / un@@ roll in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
when changing the part to the context browser , the context browser automatically displays when the next play is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the Fon@@ ts section , you can set the usage of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use the otherwise gray displayed section . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browser . press Cho@@ ose ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the Custom color scheme you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ections that are enabled for foreground and background color .
continue playback at the start that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start resume play automatically with the piece at the spot with which it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the shadow of the shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for fonts and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for selecting colors . if your own colors are not activated , the default &amp; k@@ de colors will be used .
the Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify the screen of a multi @-@ screen environment to appear on the O@@ SD .
the map audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers still activate additional settings in this card .
the card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection , including the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively Browse sub @-@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Browse the inter@@ folders as well as their sub@@ folders to music .
monitor changes : allow &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . an incre@@ mental search is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all the play@@ lists found in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will later appear in the playlist browser .
the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section will be used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . on Calcul@@ ator : enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under Port : the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the load@@ .@@ f@@ m card board supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the pieces played to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . so you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a little guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
some functions , such as the O@@ SD , assume that your window manager lists the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by looking at ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the times this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes from this file when reading met@@ a information . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b has been compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatic switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open in case of a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not label it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tags ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags from $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tags ( $ v@@ 2@@ tags , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten . you can sometimes click on a symbol in the Control Center under App@@ ear@@ ance icons . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting displays its effect .
if you get this error : cat@@ up error : cat@@ ac@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok will use the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ k@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version , or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to customize the correct version of Amar@@ ok .
most installation problems are most easily resolved by the help of an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter only one error if you are interested in fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do pieces of music get in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start -@@ sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Tools statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select Show column . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; short commands . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select Remove From Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist to the playlist and drop it there , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button is stored . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ ary , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be reached in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
no . yes , this really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be Which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are supplied ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat MP3 k@@ de , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Extension Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio simultaneously . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mix@@ ers ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you might need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only want to listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer will read the file , de@@ code it and send the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ ori@@ zation ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts Driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and Amar@@ ok ; from . why ?
after you have installed G@@ Stre@@ amer , you will need to register all components . follow the follow @-@ up register to register all of the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok earlier ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report this to bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by Br@@ its Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are arous@@ ed by the soft sounds of the music you &apos;ve stopped prior to bed .
how to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button turns a piece in the queue order into the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the symbol in the system section of the Control bar ?
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to link to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . a file browser with multiple folders will open . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v file , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ discount , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically this is the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less impact each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can change the valuation of a piece just as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the item and Edit : select review or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata dialog .
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified publication plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can easily find ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option symbol while playing animated in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings toolbar ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance Con@@ text Browser Design , click New Design to install ....
the icon was similar to the war@@ p graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) logo . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or Navigation Pan@@ e allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in Kon@@ quer@@ or . launch Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu .
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably need to install a distribution that has the development files installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install again .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with shr@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without shr@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module also has to be installed in addition to the G@@ Stre@@ amer fa@@ ad module .
you will get the &apos; There is no element present to handle the stream &apos; mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 @-@ Stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output give you the device . typical for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog by x@@ ine , and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not taken care of . of course you are welcome to take this issue yourself ! if you want , you can become the new much @-@ needed main@@ tain@@ er for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the Setup Wizard that is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the assistant , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text box for filtering the collection facilitates the search for specific pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the button playlist . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the Play@@ back button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audio : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just right @-@ click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have several options for burning a CD .

in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including the running text display . you can change by using the available analy@@ zer by clicking the mouse with the left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also under the scroll function . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting E@@ quali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play @-@ position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous play .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the Player window . once you mark the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
context Browser shows different information about the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub@@ windows will be discussed later in detail .
if you &apos;ve already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window has been dropped off . the information displayed there are now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be collected in the Statistics window ( Tools statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover image of the album and a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon next to it . click on this icon to look up the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you will find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . you can see how often and when the piece has been played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng formats are supported . the context browser will also show cover images which are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter . this section displays the five most valued pieces of the current interpreter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window , right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the pop @-@ up menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work up and you will see the album &apos;s content .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the Text sub@@ window , the downloaded text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages with the help of scripts written by yourself . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required for this .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are arranged by artist and below will be another distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Differ@@ ent Interpre@@ ts .
group Artist / Year - Album - S@@ ort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by one another . the artist is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be shown first by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the collection settings . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re@@ record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own lots of pieces , this might take a while .
there is a search filter directly below the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes about using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
there is a selection box under the search filter , which allows you to filter out the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select from the last 24 hours to one year . of course you can also select your entire collection , which means that the filter will be switched off practically .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection Browser you will receive the following options .
load - This will emp@@ ower the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
app@@ end to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will get the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
commit to media player - Add the pieces in the queue to transfer to the media player . see the section about the Media Player Browser for more details .
burn all pieces of this artist / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Displays the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation and it will appear under Differ@@ ent Interpre@@ ts .
record selection marking - Chan@@ ges a compilation of selected album back to a normal album . after that the album will no longer be shown under Differ@@ ent Interpre@@ ts but again under the respective artist .
the play@@ lists browser easily handles the use of many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Add Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , using your portable media player ( such as iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer songs to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Artist . when you are done , click Apply . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . when the transfer is complete , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive connection for your iPod .
the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files that do not meet your search criteria are hidden in the file list .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . for example , when you enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z you can listen to music in the musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping the key . in this case , holding down the Shift key may be helpful : this will automatically insert invalid files at the end of the list , and not in the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop . once you enter the letters , only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter del@@ im@@ ited search terms by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two three , the search will find all the entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter the search term OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with griff@@ on feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the keyword : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants as you wish . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow und@@ o and restore , so you can und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar is a unique , larger analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu such as that which you can see in the player window via the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example playback controls and volume controls . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed , a sli@@ der for the playing position and the playing time of the current piece . the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by double clicking in the respective display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window , or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist . this menu allows you to access &amp; Amar@@ ok settings .
a click on this entry will open the Visual plug @-@ in window . there you can select the Visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can launch them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover management . select :
the queue management received your big move into &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue a number appears next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ specified ( details on the setup of these follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces already exist in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this dynamic playlist .
double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window , or right @-@ click on them and then select Load . this way , your current playlist will be replaced with the new one . so you should save the old playlist .
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the play@@ lists received start with an empty playlist and you will need to add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece exchange , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , turn on the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry .
the New button re@@ fills the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens for editing the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for coming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece twice in that playlist . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed while resp@@ ecting the setting .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continue to grow because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists and smart play@@ lists . if you tick several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you have selected .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Configuration .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok -@@ scripts by clicking on the script . a selection dialog will open where you can select a script package for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you no longer wish to use a script , you can delete it . select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ts section .
the dialog window Visual Plugins is used to enable the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start Guide should show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . to track the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when re@@ coding to MP3 , you will get a worse quality no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ sy format .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start Guide should show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to track the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and insert the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible burning settings .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the Start button . you will now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the original image is read into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
to fix this problem , run q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the webpage of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback there , draw on community help from the forums and get news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program will burn audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; and even expand those functions . therefore , sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , it reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet , such programs are generally called ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio coding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder and En@@ co@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a far @-@ developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , for example , it is possible to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files to burn them afterwards to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
seri@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the various albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces play differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the related sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new filen@@ ame .
save the current project under a new filen@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save as shown by which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file Save File .
closes the current project . if a project has changed and hasn &apos;t been saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose to drop it and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you called for each project file C@@ lose .
closes all opened projects and closes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it as if you were called to C@@ lose File .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the resulting dialog . this has the same effect as if you are drawing the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the &quot; Burn &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button Burn , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burning the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described about the What is the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you merge files for a multi @-@ session CD , even if this function is not used . it is more than helpful for you , so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes any files from the medium , it only masks the previously imported files .
this also allows you to create a copy of a CD onto another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn some@@ time later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to create a copy of a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn some@@ time later . alternatively , the conversion / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD + Â± R ( W ) , so the content will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burning a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burning a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used all @-@ in @-@ one . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes media properties , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of toolbar buttons for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the table of contents is enabled , its content is displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the table of contents allows selecting and dra@@ gging files to the project view . the table of contents is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive with an appropriate CD / DVD is selected in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the key assignment .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are needed , so you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
open the settings from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can set up general application settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work right away . this dialog is designed for custom@@ izing and fine @-@ tuning the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which of the contribut@@ or programs you give preference .
in this chapter we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then type something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions which have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b provides functions like copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD , and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ UR@@ ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project using K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used for data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String Transpar@@ ency ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String ur@@ l , Q@@ String Transpar@@ ency ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String Transpar@@ ent ) void set @-@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folders :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT app@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audio creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read@@ out for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; audio creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on hard disk ) and supported by many enco@@ ders that en@@ code these WAV files ( these enco@@ ders packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they are installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , &amp; audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile it yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ mer gives a small introduction about encoder , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device to circum@@ vent protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD is afterwards explained on the hard disk . this ( hopefully ) leads to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble over at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , recording everything manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . step by step , for example , you will find more information on how to use this program and screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of CD @-@ data according to the set @-@ up of request on the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup Cat@@ alog - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default . note that previously the encoder has been configured in the Configuration Options tab in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for encoding than a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the Setup dialog to configure the types of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , p@@ pl@@ ets ) for program events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main dialog of &amp; audio creator ; with different card cards ( such as encoder , to set the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , encoder and compression rates , and helps you choose the correct encoding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C , there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the draw@@ backs are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression , depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders produce excellent audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , but l@@ ame is supplied free of charge with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG for lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play devices is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support the MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 kb@@ ps for all tracks of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car oster@@ oo@@ zers . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ stated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality regardless of the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched through the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / use with &amp; cd creator ; and the encoder program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le to the keyword ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t must be added by l@@ ame and the title Par@@ ameters of &amp; Audio Creator ; the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audio creator ; parameters that can be needed ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that you can download / enter information , so that all others can download this information instead of yourself into the computer . it is to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translation ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information released publicly on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt .
in &amp; Audio Creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( fake ) address as the one in the system . in this way of configuration , it appears that the email address is not used when calling the data from the server ( This can only be the programmers who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; when using fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirr@@ oring server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see also note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not been done yet .
to save the read WAV files , the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains predefined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself .
the encoder package must be installed from the related Linux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about encoder is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; kon@@ sole ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not be possible !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that will make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; read out . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 samples ( tags ) .
you must have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found using a search engine since it is considered as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permissions on it ( eg by trying to copy something inside with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; audio creator ; something that is thought to be done only once , and
the second section describes the procedure to read out a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them every time you read a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the box map General Settings . there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
select only In case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed if there is a lack of information on creating keywords ( tags ) .
the box CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; if you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries , they can be changed easily . the directory and file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice whether this is worth it . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first one .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , but as many fire@@ walls the protocol 88@@ 80 is standard , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to send a CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should be sufficient .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously dischar@@ ged pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , so simply try it yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check for the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be strai@@ gh@@ tened to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good stereo hi @-@ fi systems . the resulting bit rate is approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just have the basic set up of &amp; audio creator ; finished . this configuration is used as the default for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely you never need to change it again .
in this section it is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is set up because we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of the fre@@ ed@@ b must be retri@@ eved .
since we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots view a bit different from the data used for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of fet@@ ching them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look for the Help section in the section Questions and Ans@@ wers or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled in and the artist &apos;s name and album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which in your opinion best fits your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; -@@ settings in the Settings dialog ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but retrieve the data from the Internet , you will need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; field , unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece .
the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all compositions of the CD .
attention : after successfully retri@@ eving the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; audio creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the created files anytime with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously does not match the style of the read@@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; go back to the main window . just click on the row with the second one .
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . specify the title of the piece in any case and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
note : this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the parts list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the row switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if you click on the Select button to read the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
on tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window for controlling the jobs . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
you can see this error message when you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : assignment 4 is the encoding of part 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read out and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . for low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the top left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you will need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; jack Creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the k@@ ide@@ multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions already include pre @-@ compiled packages , as &amp; audio files . install the package from your distribution . if you read this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is directed to people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that inv@@ okes many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hi , still to read ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it goes on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start up ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? if you read this , you probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is considered as the first version for a manual on &amp; audio creator ; may it do . at least after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of lyrics , he also has some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound Project driver needed for CI@@ S cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the used procedure .
seat support . when you stop &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ Window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the Play item from the menu item , or press Space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for several pieces they are added to a collection and then played one after the other ) .
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the knob .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and thus change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a print on the pause button or the selection of the menu entry pause in the menu item , so interrup@@ ts playback . pressing the space bar while no play is played starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use texture events , others use lyrics event and other both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which a song is used so that you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set up an event type , select the entries for text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that summari@@ ze you . these will be played back to you . in this section you will find how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired ones in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you exit the application , this collection is not stored . remember this when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it will again display the file dialog by which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
when automatic adding to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the pieces that are still open .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the row from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs , or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select Next Song , next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right .
to reverse a song back , select the button For@@ ec@@ asts , select Pre@@ view item from the menu item or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but this does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and lets you always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should be played .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM instruments and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once except the Key@@ map section which may appear as often as desired . however , a pre@@ condition for this is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) .
default PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Key@@ map name ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section will begin ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section shows how General MIDI patches can be applied to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun . to do so , use the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it will take patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the word drum patch of the patch , in which each note represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ boards are used mainly to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the supplied key@@ bit@@ maps as an example .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , just do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . so , if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no decim@@ al comm@@ as are available ) .
this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard which receives a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try it around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the menu under Settings , item MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which tones are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button does not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu under the Channel View menu : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
so , for example , if you find that a song is too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 K@@ b , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
accept , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
always enable setting Automatic Add to Collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or b@@ yp@@ assed ( when I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; drag .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , turn off automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A@@ mid , B.@@ C and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the Automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B@@ mid and C@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , this encourages me to continue to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an enlargement of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will be listed among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; however , before sending a MIDI file , you should get in touch with me as I may already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and didn &apos;t get money from anyone for it . I would like to emphasize that I &apos;m just programming it because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. BÃ¼h@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also to Jose L@@ u San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ sel@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error correction or just a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which is located at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with additional kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that of course you cannot hear any music .
if you encounter problems , contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category of continuous play@@ lists .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level . if you click an item , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback will begin with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and continuous play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . to do this simply click on a name of a category , select from the menu View and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you must select the same with the playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files .
the animation during start and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can simply be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ MB ; note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would interfere with the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Configuration dialog from &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of S@@ MB . here is the output of m@@ player shown .
there is no tab for this playback device in the Configuration dialog from &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything needs to be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; played with the sw@@ f@@ co@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; even the special em@@ bed field can be added to the playlist XML in the playlist .
for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module must be provided as a service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the Setup dialog file As@@ sets of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . the started process means pop player . if there are no errors , the Back@@ end output inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
to ensure that a given back@@ end is always taken for a certain mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this needs to be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play cards from TV , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be ch@@ ewed , the device to use and the TV channels have to be configured . to do so , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings is under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port to use . there , ports should be detected by which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably contained a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support for S@@ MB can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . therefore , for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , various names are used by KM@@ Player for the sources . at the time of creating this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ n@@ open , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scann@@ ers , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ ones .
are there any hints how I can qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not by the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is root after mounting the device . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is pointing to the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine only starts slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for performance every time ?
note : the answer is out@@ dated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for the creation of graphical user interfaces and network support and is used for comp@@ iling &amp; ti@@ pping ;
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , probably the package &amp; tex@@ tra@@ d ; res@@ or@@ ted for older systems .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - independent of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the box ; -@@ website .
if you have questions about the compilation of &amp; Ki@@ le , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the ability to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical user interface and within this a simple , immediate and custom access to all &amp; latex ; programs . furthermore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the ability to complete , comp@@ iling , re @-@ editing and troubleshooting within the source code as well as conversion and viewing tools for this . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and to experience its options , consult the K@@ ate manual . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate directly with reading the chapter .
for &amp; latex ; is the right language : lay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a lay@@ man ( lay ) &amp; latex ; mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here is given only a good overview on &amp; latex , it is not the ultimate book about it . to be properly profi@@ cient , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
same as other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; latex ; an introduction that defines the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick entry assistant from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some options for the creation of the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; curriculum &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ d@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for the correct processing of the &amp; latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex and latex . for the integration , they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it &apos;s just a short description of the functions and further information on this is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers - as well as other source editors - high@@ lighting the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le , it is very likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed . however , you have noticed it due to the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will save time and effort by high@@ lighting .
with the automatic completion of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates an empty line ( for the input of the text ) and the associated line for the command of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the Settings box ; set ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub @-@ screen the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; latex files , the search search can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; more independent file &#93; is created , skip &amp; Ki@@ le ; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ Viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; latex ; -@@ Source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the available output types by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the back button , the elements of the DVI ; file are selected with the editor and once it has been cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file is the exact opposite of it . as soon as it has been cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; latex ; source code is cli@@ cked to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set via project project settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; quick installation : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; latex &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there is no error in the source code ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ sider &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this mode , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick mounting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick classification of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available and latex commands for sub@@ division are :
the further selection field is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available possibilities are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or other element is created .
cover : used for reference to a specified term ( choose from a selection box ) .
using Qu@@ ote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file is related to a project . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã Â¶ t@@ ley is used for determining the font size . it can be set the font s for the main text , the jo@@ in@@ ties , etc . there are the following font sizes available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings .
the par@@ enth@@ esis after the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class lists the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
as soon as the source code above has been entered , the &amp; latex has to be compiled ; the easiest way to do this is the use of the volume building or the button of button construction .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; it automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if the document fails , it should be searched for errors during the logging process . if it is used for quick installation , the ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
a environment ( environment ) is a text that is handled differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report containing a text size 12 and a few columns should have a different type of text . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } , then the change of the font can be set within the environment .
changes are reserved only within the environment ( environment ) up to \ \ end { environment } ) . there are no restrictions ( number ) for change within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . it can , for example , be added to certain fonts , bold print , passive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be itali@@ c represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; latex has been displayed , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
as soon as a little text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . at least one quote , a few places in the bold and ital@@ ics pressure and a poem are to be used to see the differences in these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor @-@ View or C@@ trl E can be returned back to the editor ( internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ age ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ i output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are necessary as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - you can print the document by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar allows converting the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; nbsp ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to do this , just setup Modern under Settings Ki@@ le ... Tools to be selected .
in order to execute the advance search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then be cli@@ cked on forward search . the jump to the corresponding point in DVI ; the viewer takes place then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document of &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( setting up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if using quick @-@ build / DVI ; viewers do not open , a fault can be found . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window .
the log file expl@@ ores the source of errors in the source code . in the editor , the buttons for La@@ Te@@ X errors and other La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used between the errors . the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears . in order to view the faulty line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the faulty line .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document may either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . further information is included in the section .
independent users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file needs to be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using the creation of an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings Ki@@ le ... Settings can be set .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have to be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex files ; an easy way to create a template will be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below should be executed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( among them also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to experience its options , the manual should be used for K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter Works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; -@@ command reference , which can be called via the Men@@ Ã Â¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex , as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with a pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex -@@ word . this means that in this way , when you click on \ \ par of \ \ par \ big@@ ad@@ .@@ skip is only \ \ par .
when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source codes and emphasize them . for example , the basic and latex commands differ from normal text and mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can add additional jump tok@@ ens . this is a distinct type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu Edit Spring@@ phones or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut the jump to the next or final spr@@ ing@@ time stamp . this stamp is also highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already outstanding features have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; -@@ Source text added , and therefore support &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for selection . under Edit Sel@@ ection the following commands are included in the selection of text :
contains a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning is thus not meant as a text with single rows ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning is thus associated with tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . this is the only cur@@ pointing cause in &amp; Ki@@ le ; this means that the sections are separated by two blank lines .
this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also has an extended meaning , since this command is also available with latex and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , natural this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . under Edit removal the following commands are included in the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is contained in the description to edit Select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in and latex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for additional commands in the editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command is used to jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command is used to jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) .
if the cursor is in front of or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environmental commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command completes the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; latex ; -@@ groups specified by { ... } groups . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from working environment .
this command is used to jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
this command is used to jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the closed clasp .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , it will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering multiple bra@@ ided group bra@@ ces quickly the overview can be lost . this command is the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple instructions are used as a bed for use . for the purpose @-@ bearing implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple quotes . &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and for two closing statements for latex .
this automatic entry of double quotes can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
there can also be custom settings ( e.g. , german or french ) , and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when using Shift ; Enter key &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break , but also the command \ \ item .
within a table -@@ environment , complete &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to make this possible . while using Shift ; Alt ; amp ; looks &amp; Ki@@ le ; according to the next tab in the next line . although this tab is not the associated table , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some space for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already provides a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; in order to implement special commands ( mostly for latex ; ) , three different modes are built . all of these modes can be set up for different modes of working under Settings ... Complete set .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the reset button is pressed , the last character of the input is removed and , as a result , the complete list is set up . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively from &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jump stamps be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by working on the Ank@@ le mark N@@ Ã Â¤ r@@ st jump brand and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; setting up ... Ki@@ le ; adjustments can be made to these lists . there can be various lists of sounds for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as books of general language use .
the command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there must always be entered a few letters with \ \ begin and the call of the default mode will result in a large list of ambient comm@@ its . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environments .
when calling the completion @-@ mode over the Men@@ Ã Â¼ editing area or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment completion can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; C@@ le ; realizing that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be included .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; setting up ... Ki@@ le ; def@@ aults can be made to these lists . this mode uses the List of Dis@@ counts mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; support user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations that are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... C@@ le can be set up . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the character L is entered and the word def@@ aults to completion or the C@@ trl + Alt space bar is introduced , the character L is replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large we@@ a@@ vers are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been established that many we@@ a@@ vers are written in a document more than once . thus offers &amp; Ki@@ le ; the comprehen@@ sion for all already written we@@ a@@ vers .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... C@@ le can be completely shut down . here you can also set the threshold value for the ad to be completed .
the files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the local home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã Â¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the Prin@@ ts dialog box designs the design of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be taken into account .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re @-@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to be able to examine the result of the work , first the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in groups in the building compilation , creating conversion and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used the keyboard short@@ cut Alt ; 2 . afterwards the DVI ; file can be viewed in a standard @-@ like viewer by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file converted to a PS file and be viewed by old ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick Building command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open every time .
a new project will be asked about the Project New Project .... here you will find the following information for the project :
when you fill the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function from &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; delivered with a lot of documents , including a documentation for the packages included and a further &amp; latex reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete user manual for the &amp; latex ; commands included and is therefore ideal for searching for a certain format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tra@@ d ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tra@@ d ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; Ki@@ le ; delivered documents and here for a graphical surface .

&amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for emails . with the command line interface you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file is from &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can design your e @-@ mails in a varied and unique way .
for day signatures the same signature from the signature file is from &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures , you create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this will give you an empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and add your new signature in the bottom section . signature example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save them with C@@ trl ; S File Save or click the Save button .
you can create as many signatures as you want . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you are using e @-@ mails personally or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Remove or click on the icon with the red cross removal in the toolbar .
here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then right @-@ click on the Custom button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ ze , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not wait until someone builds up the desired in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start with the Edit Plugins section . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all of the included plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member out of the list and pressing the button S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after which you are : text .
nick@@ names and their own identity are important in terms of messages and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to an overview of your team , there is a further advantage by cap@@ turing members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be drawing up the opening and closing of the project , so that later you can see how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that takes a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the site Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog can be created , edited and deleted .
an e @-@ mail is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the Reci@@ pi@@ ents list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project manager . see how such conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
it can be either the note entry chosen from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by Comment text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , role in the project has the following possibilities .
nick@@ names and roll names are independent of upper or lower case , but whit@@ esp@@ ace around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , the D@@ TD agnos@@ tic , and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible through the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by setting up Qu@@ anta . this dialog will cover some pages that will be treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags , including auto @-@ completion , can be changed .
upper@@ case / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal Gross / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files .
upper@@ case / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal Gross / lower@@ case means that the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ;
automatically close any optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
automatically update start and finish date : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ e types for det@@ ecting different types of files . using the Standard button , the def@@ aults can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise as with file opening of opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting here is em@@ itted from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regularly creates backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash the document can be restored from this backup at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor &apos;s area or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to look at the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset window settings to default at the next launch is useful if the user interface has been mess@@ ed up by changing M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / inter@@ facing views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message section is used to control the display of warnings by enabling non @-@ poll@@ ing of warnings .
the place to modify the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL and source text view in shared mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the mapping of the par@@ ser nodes in the document , can be set into details .
in the area of the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Struc@@ ture Tree Configuration section , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change to the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty nodes are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document .
the range for setting abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that are un@@ folded when editing to a larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the default short@@ cut is something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located in a standard as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load a component in the &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only read @-@ in parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . select the saving of the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , debu@@ gging was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G debu@@ gger . instead of this a debu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts .
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin Sel@@ ection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left D@@ ock .
a view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . normally appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . normally appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the debu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug demands . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debu@@ gger , so normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ger session Start the session . closes the connection to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger or finishes listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to the monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . happens before a debu@@ gging requirement is given , the execution begins once a request is made .
the debu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the debu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include files .
instruc@@ t the Deb@@ ug@@ ger to move over the directive and go to the next as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered that is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable list view .
this dialog can enter a variable or set a new value to a variable .

this chapter describes how you can customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help get better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to provide support for marker and script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages respectively &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar ; and Tag@@ XML files include handy , symbol @-@ oriented bars of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , adding text and instructions faster to a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be manually created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . toolbar buttons allow quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a write error .
tag Archives are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is described in a simple way .
this is the root element of an tag@@ XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but an element type of itself .
the type of tags is a script function . when used , att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
applied only to the type method . specify the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common @-@ attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to each other day . ( only Family 1 )
set a text in the dialog . this text is defined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it sets the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are further tags describing how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
indicates the source code used for filling for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag which groups the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each tag ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag that can be defined . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration starts : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is up in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to launch the window and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this feature is currently not available yet . currently , the check is carried out only when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element of the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the filen@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a functioning Family 2 tag XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the filen@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ key = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
open descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via D@@ TD edit D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c can be processed ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can set actions with Settings ... to be created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the User Defin@@ ed button a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the defined settings and when the action is executed , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can start external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even the spr@@ ing@@ start dialog or the various see in ... actions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This is a global script folder : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods , a script can be input by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field you can specify what is to be sent to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages written to the default output . it can be specified what should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value in the selection box output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start the edit mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete it all and , if the day has attributes , and you plan to use their use , enable &quot; Edit Day &quot; dialog when available , so that an input is possible when using the action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol ? who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
to create a symbol that represents the action better we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edit Size .
please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with a view that the day start is called , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly seen as los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start ; -@@ Tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it has to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the toolbar or it should be split into several groups for a better overview . open the toolbar , set dialog on Settings toolbar . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
I want to select the Tren@@ ner ( top left corner ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element which is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to preview a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by absor@@ bing all the symbols to make sure that everything works .
backup in the correct folder . after New XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that your toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to find an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you have to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we will leave the first part to you , the second we treat here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for this documentation for example &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = func@@ tions@@ 1 = func@@ tions@@ 1 = func@@ tions@@ 1 = func@@ tions@@ 1 = func@@ tions@@ 1 = func@@ tions@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = func@@ tions@@ .@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation as follows :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element top item = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Contents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and conveniently located at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the section of the doc@@ r@@ c file which is used for creating context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connector lines .
a simple list of text @-@ separated contex@@ tual elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your doc@@ r@@ c file simply to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that this is good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Community . you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places there is an Email menu item , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send with email , send tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scrip@@ te tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to make a financial contribution , we recommend to sign the resources for which it requires a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the future users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private g@@ p@@ g key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , you have to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and by clicking OK the Upload will be started .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , up@@ loading the toolbar &apos;s toolbar , and can be started from the files and folders context menu in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed properly , a notification appears with the indication of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in tag XML format . there &apos;s the easier way to convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD Load and Con@@ ver@@ ting menu of D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD declaration to use . then the following dialog appears :
destination directories name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that is in ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine setting of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand them and to draw full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to explain these concepts to them without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . from tool@@ bars to actions , everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to backup different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that only this user can use them personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the building man@@ sions , the tabs with information and tool@@ bars . please check in and for more information about these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all tab , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor area leads to another context menu regarding the edited document content , such as the basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the word under the mouse @-@ cursor , or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor window are the toolbar buttons . currently &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of toolbar buttons is displayed .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a simple tag , such as &amp; lt ; if they want to insert into their document , then click on the icon representing the tag . now you can insert the data for that just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill out different fields in a dialog .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , to open and ro@@ am them . in the presentation with cart@@ ons , for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building views are available .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows administrators to manage files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the contex@@ tual menu displayed .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; All possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working range . global templates are always available , local templates only for the relevant user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the spin @-@ off in Global , Local and Project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the application system focused on the content allows changing all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the option to define custom commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you get a tool bar in an email , you can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other save and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while attempting to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the most powerful web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why developing what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details , help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check the section on templates . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported .
converts the special characters to &amp; HTML for past@@ ing from the clip@@ board where they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; write which is the correct way to insert special characters and whit@@ esp@@ ace into &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
turn on or off block sel@@ ections . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are out !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of the script actions and the debu@@ gger .
pressing and switching the problem report at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem report is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the column column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Pre@@ t@@ ty or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
displays a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
load a Project Tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog box to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions need to be set by settings actions ... saved . tool bars are stored on tool tracks toolbar , or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar yet , you will be asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool bar is available in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading of toolbar buttons to the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else has done and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the store will fail .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu Standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current date settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied if this day is contrary to the rules .
in the Plugins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . click on them . if you click on an activated plugin , it will be disabled .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the current file .
sel@@ ects the line end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or create un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on / off .
changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones and change the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should best be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g@@ example ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the setup of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars as standard . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently .
be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook .
with this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clip from the project .
the last screen of the new Project Assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded from the Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the Pro@@ files window or Shift + F@@ 7 key short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders ) that will be ignored for project related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows you to select the desired debu@@ gger . currently only gu@@ bed is supported . more information about gu@@ bed can be found in . the debu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set using the Options button . debu@@ gging is described .
in the Profile tab , Upload Pro@@ files ( see in ) can be set as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited , or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the Event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , modify or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as the backing up of a file . see the details .
by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or the Project tab Open from the toolbar . the dialog Open Project will be displayed and allows you to select a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries opening and opening are missing ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows removal of the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button is bl@@ ended to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten at the end of the program . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high loading profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be shown :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the upload protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should be able to choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , unless the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is saved on the disk , so it is not easy to read , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give a lot of views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted from the Project Tool@@ bar menu or the Project toolbar , accessible from the Settings toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which you can do the most . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to your own way of working .
as already mentioned above , tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us are best stack@@ able via the menu toolbar . use and adding differ . adding tool bars is handled down in the section Add of Tool@@ bars .
the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either through context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the toolbar ) , in which other actions such as tool bar can be removed , toolbar can be renamed or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be indicated which actions on this or other toolbar should be displayed .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up toolbar settings in the Settings menu ... and set Settings ...
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ ps and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you make for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; delivered templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ aries . binary templates are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specialized documents are created in corresponding sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organizes the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents again and again . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl based .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
design a document structure as desired ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template Save as a local template ...
once this has happened , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate Save option as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as pulling and dropping or past@@ ing over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or project files , select a site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , the project folder will be backed up , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very pur@@ pos@@ eful approach . you can pre@@ tend to he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically create with &amp; PHP ; design , insert or link them to them . in addition , some things can be kept very deep in mind when using templates in projects .
the Tem@@ plate structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files laid in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / templates / templates .
to set the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates .
this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the Tem@@ plate Overview . if a root folder is set up , it would disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or ann@@ ot@@ ated text templates for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying contents templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you can use context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor that can be reached through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second spl@@ its the editor window into two parts : the source editor and V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor on a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ don of &amp; PHP ; source text . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; edit &amp; PHP ; to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one except that at the same time the changes both in the source editor and V@@ PL ; editor is visible and the cursor is in sync with the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor is already active , the touch of a button will move the active cursor from one window to the other , keeping the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor can be set via settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the document properties . thus editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this can be changed :
Met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . Met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
using the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving the arrows . in rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the button or removal key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags from previously existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding ar@@ mature day .
some toolbar functions such as the T@@ ables Assistant or the Listen Anywhere are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists tool bar must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for specific elements is possible and the style sheet design can be followed .
to be able to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to compile successfully , you need out of &amp; k@@ de ; lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db compatibility mode , or@@ phan@@ ed hold points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the complete path from a filen@@ ame without path input . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g If , for example , a style file file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ do@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a default named QNA@@ P@@ cloud or a specified mode name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP that contains the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNA@@ P@@ cloud &quot; is extended according to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a required stop point must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each flow .

if a value is specified for the &quot; search@@ resul@@ t@@ sp@@ ath &quot; option , all output files are stored in this folder . otherwise , search@@ .x@@ s@@ l will edit the folder of the style template .
if the command &quot; search &quot; is executed , an x@@ ml file called search@@ results .x@@ ml will be created . this file can then be edited with a custom style template to show the data in another form , if the &quot; prefer@@ ential &quot; option is not set , the file search@@ .@@ txt is displayed .

adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ TER ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; added to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation on the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
if --@@ repeat is specified twice , the conversion will be performed 100 times
the input documents are treated as HTML files if the support for this is enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml
enables X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document if the support for it has been enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml . this is turned on as default .
with the Re@@ ad@@ line library installed , you can scroll through the arrow keys to / off via the exp@@ iry date of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a stop point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; .
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template which consists only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 up to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name such as &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
filen@@ ame : a valid local filen@@ ame on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are also allowed on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems .
path : a path to change the folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : the XML data or the XML document that is processed by the style template . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME@@ TER ; &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ gt ;

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this feature turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of each other on one piece of code and make changes . the merge editor among the differences windows allows for resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; for folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and resist@@ s the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to frequently check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is identical and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , you can make typing work easier by only writing the file name of the first file . for example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 @-@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der Fol@@ ders
the Open dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will remember your selection and display it again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files is performed .
by the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , however , for B and C a folder then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the filen@@ ame from A in the other two folders .
if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not strictly necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Set@@ ting button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / mer@@ ging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . in the opening dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use Drag and Drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would first need to create two corresponding files , load them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; load and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text to another program as cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the complete name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized one can see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when comparing three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merge ) .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre @-@ processor and in few rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line on broken lines is scored points .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line labeled Output : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; Change &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflicts to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , any difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be resolved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . ( this will also cause a jump of position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes no more row is left in the group through the automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no line is displayed in the queue ; this is only a wild@@ card for the case that you change your mind and maybe re @-@ insert another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy this text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources to ignore the numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , up , down , side down , side down , start , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
you can also use the other buttons to edit in the display window . with the insert button you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns to synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the Mer@@ ge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven navigation buttons with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ above ) or to the next / previous non @-@ resolved conflict . note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; all non @-@ automatically solved conflicts remain regarded as conflict even after manual conflict . therefore , conflicts between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Pa@@ ste ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and manual copying is om@@ itted . be careful with this option because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use a carriage return + line feed character \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end of the source files , so you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved when you exit and restored at the next start . ( set up menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the chosen font does not support this representation nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be scanned . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically adju@@ sts an odd color .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of space characters is inserted when the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button is pressed . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
when you press Enter or Return , the reset of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each option is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
you can select which line end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return character \ &apos; r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others save only a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car return sign , but then , files with different sizes in page @-@ on @-@ side comparison might look identical , however like a white sign . while mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow on very large files .
in automatic spr@@ int mode , this setting determines how long the result will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
this is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the Func@@ tion A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic selection also applies conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore figures or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the section on how to scan folders and execute a merge operation . see documentation on directory comparison and merge tracking for details .
if a file is saved and an older version already exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to exit and re@@ boot so that the change will be active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
in the selection fields for the encoding a short note appears , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually configurable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
when editing a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processor commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processor commands .
turn off this to supp@@ ress the emphasis of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the Options are ignor@@ ing numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color coded over@@ see column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply blend the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide instantly to merge the files . merge the current file in the merge menu also works if you compare only two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut off annoying parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processor command is also specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only for line query . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is required and most users do not want to program it himself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line queries to convert the input to capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ular expression that matches any string . the \ \ U returns the found text in upper@@ case .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . so , a pre @-@ processing command for line abor@@ tion is required . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line adjustments . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several replac@@ ements at a time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements . example :
instead of sed you can use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for display and mer@@ ging . further operations only alter the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders in recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object to be merged ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate mer@@ ging and displays the simul@@ ated changes without really performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , a small message window informs you about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files that have been compared until then are listed .
when the scan of the folders is completed , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually shown together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - or by double @-@ clicking on the object . the directory menu contains two functions Un@@ folding All sub @-@ directories and fl@@ aps all sub@@ directories with which you can open / un@@ fold all the folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the comparison window will be started and a comparison window will appear .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected .
as seen in the picture above , the columns A / B / C uses the colors red , green , yellow and black .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered iden@@ tically if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . for folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for his color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. when A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging can &apos;t be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. when A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging can &apos;t be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchron@@ ize dir@@ s . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; select the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B do exist , but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees only B as visible filen@@ ame for the output file ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
when two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) is enabled , then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different but the same date appears , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
while mer@@ ging , a file will be processed after the other . it Status column shows completed if the merge was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ DE will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all mer@@ ging actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can launch the merge .
note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der Mer@@ ge mode , C is used as the destination , while the two @-@ folder mer@@ ging B is chosen as the destination and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the destination .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries should be in the target folder , also displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select / start directory merge / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry , select Run action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid interaction actions , a message appears that indicates the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options passing , simul@@ ating and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select another directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , then an appropriate dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; continue working with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; st@@ akes on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , let &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been merged individually , these entries ( in the current session ) will not work together again . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries are merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set menu Set@@ ting - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) has now a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ op@@ tically generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hiding @-@ attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a preceding point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
when the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to yourself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed benefit costs you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
similar to the date of change , there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal in size . this can be useful , for example , when the modification date is lost . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
enable the synchronization mode if two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected in such a way that after both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are saved in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , the copy of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too . ) This option is disabled in default . )
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another one , the original version is renamed and gets the .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal merge of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is turned on in default .
you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can disable the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can disable the pop @-@ up window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder collapse .
this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ reading
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space = &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished as to whether a link to a file or folder shows . then always a file is assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or change date . therefore , the permissions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ dence of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently considered a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ DE Part display from the context menu .
normally it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then removes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program will start to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view K@@ DE Part from the Pre@@ view context menu . note that this does not work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now called Kom@@ pare ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the diff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure will install in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as iden@@ tically ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical .
the editor is aware of any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information .
the effort has been too large so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text another editor should be used .
after removing the text suddenly ; no sr@@ c is left ; and the text cannot be cleared . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ leading the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
for information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , please visit the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir Speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see the RE@@ AD@@ ME file for more details .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . should you still encounter difficulties , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) copies into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift ) add the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position and replace the current marker .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the refresh function . )
there are only entries that show differences . this also causes identical files to be copied not to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default this option is disabled . note in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , stop them or shift them . this works both inside a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible both inside a desktop and other work surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only displays the two entries P@@ ager ... and Finish . however , if an application is cli@@ cked inside &amp; K@@ p@@ Storage , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected Virtual Desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces .
when this field is enabled , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is inter@@ sec@@ ted together with name , the names will be provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is enabled , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to allow selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with their default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be specified : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shown in a 2x@@ N grid , as from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in horizontal and vertical lines in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move windows as symbols or with their contents .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up switch @-@ over switch ... make the dialog box appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen resolution . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; to enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; browse , a window appears as shown above . the main window of the screen shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is labeled as a magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to below as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to indicate a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor position . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ cursor .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse into the magni@@ fying pane and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this is also possible with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; likes ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to the clip@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
start or stop the update of the ad . stopping the update will cause the CPU time to be set against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , large and smaller &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen@@ shot . you can magni@@ fier ; use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impair@@ ment .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the repe@@ ating Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click is causing pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer may be caused by a doctor if this is not done yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool helps to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and triggers a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement .
the intelligent shifting activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the mouse button is pressed . in this way , you can drag the mouse with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be plug@@ ged at the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if Intelli@@ gent@@ es Move is enabled , the Turn field is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the mouse button is waiting before the mouse button is pressed again , if there is no moving of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click by mouse shift . if this function is enabled , a slower move will be saved to the right and back followed by a pause , one click with the right mouse button . this moves will be stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the General tab . there &apos;s a scroll bar sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically .
reset all settings to the values that were set when you open the dialog . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the final pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , smart moving should be turned off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds .
first of all , you should make a conscious mind in which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not constitute a link leads to un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick here is that you do not just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to remove the mouse ball . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe off the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or your f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started shifting , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , which can no longer termin@@ ate the operation by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , using another window manager and moving a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can perform a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input . thus , accidental moving of mouse &amp; eg can cause unwanted reactions . safe zones for mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to highlight text , copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it again or perform any other action by which you might want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice on this :
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will be played every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the move time starts with intelligent shifting . later , you can use the intelligent shifting even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but for that , it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X Window System must be installed . this should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and a speaker and is properly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and who are causing pain to be affected by the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a drag process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , the drag and drop can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ utter ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course sentences that are to be spoken once again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can often choose used text pas@@ sage@@ ways without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you define the vocabulary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language in order to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can reconci@@ le the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the vocabulary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ utter ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a course memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you mouth , you can enter the sentences that you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is app@@ ended to the default memory . you can choose sentences that should be spoken once again .
with the Settings @-@ mouth menu entry , set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ utter ; This dialog contains two file cards , voice output and settings , the word completion and the K@@ TT@@ IP language service page .
in the input field of the voice output , enter the command to enter the language generator . in the box below the input field , specify the character encoding that the text will be passed to the voice generator .
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a voice service , as first attempt to pass the text to K@@ TT@@ IP language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d voice service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text@@ book text@@ book or in the bar for text pas@@ times .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen passage will be directly spoken and additionally inserted into the default memory . with the selection of In the input field the selected passage will be entered only in the input field .
the second selection field C@@ lose the editing window for text pas@@ sage@@ pane allows you to specify whether the text pass@@ book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
the book stores the book with the selection of text pass@@ book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . select Save as requested , and k@@ utter ; ask if the text pass@@ book should be stored .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger page contains a list of Wor@@ ter@@ Trou@@ ble dic@@ tion@@ aries . in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; k@@ utter ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons to the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the desired language for this source ; and mouth ; then read the listings . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; mouth ; ask then which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , make a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text pas@@ sage@@ ways is divided into two . in the upper part , the text pas@@ times are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you chose a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
actions such as new text passages or books add or delete selected text passages and books can be achieved either through the selection in the menu bar , toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text pass@@ books or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text will be cut and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected parts of the processor will be selected .
the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected parts of the processor will be selected .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected phrases will be used .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the toolbar can be moved by default over the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with notes about the state of &amp; k@@ utter ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text pas@@ times is displayed with entries . by default the bar is located above the editing pane under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for voice output properly or not fully . open Settings k@@ hole ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the voice output file . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the Festival for free without dis@@ semin@@ ating restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java , written language generator . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and to further dis@@ semin@@ ate Free@@ T@@ TS without restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ts folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
/ usr / local / bin / local / bin / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further voice service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the adjustment of the language generator is only done in K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use the option kt@@ m@@ d as a voice service in &amp; mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ IP language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ utter ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ utter ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application with which people who can &apos;t speak can have text output through the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always re @-@ spend .
note that &amp; k@@ utter doesn &apos;t include voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . a voice syn@@ thesizer should be installed on the computer .

at the first start of kt@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card reader is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variations for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ lines for the same printer .
if you click on the tab @-@ tab Spo@@ k@@ es@@ man in kt@@ m@@ gr , the card reader will appear . this will appear automatically when you start kt@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on top of the list . the top speaker will be used for voice output if there is no speaker .
select a speaker from the list with one click and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with one click and click this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with one click and click on this button to move the speaker down one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; t@@ ts ; -@@ system .
choose a tuning @-@ type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and female voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the card card and check that the T@@ TS service is enabled by &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use orders to read text . click on the map to create and manage text messages .
if you have at least one speaker , you can launch &amp; k@@ de the language dispens@@ ing system . click on the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options .
check this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders are displayed and you can create text jobs and read them . see . remove the mark , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the box is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr appears automatically when reading the control bar , it will disappear as soon as the read is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start , pause , pause and resume text jobs .
the buttons in this series allow you to read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab card tab and tick the box ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed page . then check the text you want to read and select Tools Text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should start .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ lines and other invisible stamps are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor from &amp; k@@ de ; you can pre @-@ read the displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text you want to read and select Tools Text from the main menu . then the speech output should start .

filters for string replacement provide a good way to correct in &amp; kt@@ ts ; incorrect or faulty messages can be corrected . the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file included in the scope of delivery is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that K@@ Mail sends , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed . read also .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
text is processed in filters before it is sent to the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to substitute mis@@ pronounced words or short@@ cuts , to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the output of the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; welcome someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . every job you send orders from the card is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of them is reading , this output is stopped and terminated .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as to &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters work on the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters .
string replac@@ ements replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with predefined string bottom filters , which allow the creation of chat emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with microphone selection filters you can send jobs depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the card reader , you can read text from K@@ DE @-@ News about it . read more about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter determines that its rules are not true , the text remains unchanged to the next filter .
when a text application , a message , warning or a k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been created on the bottom . processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the below setup di@@ alogs are displayed .
to set up string replacement filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the corresponding substitute text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Gener@@ ate column . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , and the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the C@@ trl key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you can get the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID header @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copied .
the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . so the words must be del@@ im@@ ited by separ@@ ators ( blan@@ ks ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package k@@ rau@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the utility x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible over the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the voice selection filter , you can send text to a certain speaker , which is set up on the card board speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . for example , you can specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text passes to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker characteristics that the program sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card card , and you can over@@ write the selected speaker with the speaker selection filter .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , that is , start the regular expression &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you can specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text fulfil@@ s the above @-@ mentioned filter conditions , the speaker is selected which best meets the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to see the speaker selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings , or to delete all settings .
the voice selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice @-@ over@@ s API , from &amp; k@@ de ; with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD with the voice syn@@ thesizer so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the speech output API from &amp; k@@ de ; see the Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ m@@ d via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . first launch kt@@ m@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for festival , websites are not read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation symbols appear to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so whole sets are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do against it ?
make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be corrected by a string replacement filter .

the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license which you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can find the source code of k@@ de@@ file at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out @-@ of @-@ date . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . see also on the kt@@ ts webpage ; , for information not contained in this manual .
the &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table modular architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the development team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ts , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or later ) , including the k@@ deli@@ bs package and the development files for the speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher program .
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for the k@@ gres@@ sin or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created every night , you will be able to compile and install the program using the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; first use speech syn@@ thesizer to work properly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . to do so , use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of the speech @-@ dispens@@ er ; the program kt@@ m@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the setting up of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual sets . the user can leave the set or paragraph style , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application passes text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its sex is female , this is used , otherwise the best suitable speaker is chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , you &apos;ll see in .
if you click Add or Add a Spo@@ k@@ es@@ person on the Fil@@ l menu , and with it to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the box of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details on the modules , see .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival in PAT@@ H is included , you just have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text submitted to the festival . for voices that are known &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and show this grey , the voice you choose does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with larger memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click Apply to click Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed on the start of kt@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ IP reads a text . this allows you to stop or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently edited set .
with the buttons in this series you can go forward or backward in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ m@@ gr is res@@ ized to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click the audio card .
text messages are only listed and managed here . the output of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the news types of kt@@ ts ; see .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or kt@@ ts ; can not load the required libraries .
if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have AL@@ SA selected , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50 nbsp ; % corresponds to roughly half and 200@@ 5. so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out for yourself which device works with you . in doubt , select Standard .
on this map you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text assignment is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that sends messages . if you just have a long text read on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ utter ; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room .
a text message is interrupted by a message , warning , or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output is included in the queue .
this audio file is played whenever a normal text message is interrupted . if both the sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are valid only for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; Noti@@ fy messages , launch kt@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the tab Noti@@ fication will appear .
select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and des@@ kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications when a sound is played are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection box to specify what you want to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the tab card . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can set up the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the Upload button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds divide text into single phrases . this allows &amp; kt@@ ts to start reading , because only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , because only the first set can be syn@@ thes@@ ized , or stop or stop , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this .
here you can see the punc@@ tu@@ ation limit detection filter . at the first launch of &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a default , a set limit@@ er filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add more pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filters , but beginners will not be advised .
on the easiest way , you will learn how to set up the language selection by selecting . turn on the speaker selection and enter text for reading . please check the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the choice of the speaker changes . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then start reading faster , because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can pause or inter@@ rupt your text orders on the map card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it can not be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
typ@@ ef@@ ace Reco@@ gnition filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional phrases and insert a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the pro@@ posi@@ tional boundaries . note that the standard punc@@ tu@@ ation limit filter retains the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD @-@ filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filter from mistake , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application on the box menu . the card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker characteristics are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker that has all the features of a set up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; select this speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; select the speaker that best matches the originally set characteristics .
select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything .
select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in getting the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is if you know that a certain application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to delete all the features in the speaker segment , which is most likely to delete the following , click the Def@@ ault button and then use the speaker , which is most likely to follow the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number , enter 0 is required ) .
kt@@ m@@ gr falls off immediately when it is started . I have compiled debu@@ gging support , but I don &apos;t get trac@@ eability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is closed . you probably need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved , you may have installed a non compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I hold a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org for possible solutions .
I loaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / vocals . as a guide , you can add the other entries to you . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; at which you have found the voice to the developer .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . to make this work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able through the PAT@@ H environment variable . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the voice card for speaker setup . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the setting for the microphone speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) Remove the filter for converting from &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite cour@@ a@@ geous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after SS@@ ML res@@ izing filter , and set up the microphone speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
with festival 1.@@ 95 beta , S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . in order for the Festival to produce no errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate string replacement filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the box carrier orders will be shown , the job consists only from one set . what do I do wrong ?
you may not filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for the punc@@ tu@@ ation limit detection .
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer , before using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the command prompt register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
some users experience conflicts with the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freezes when you hold a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read al@@ oud .

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the Syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . help is provided in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the german voices are subject to restrictions on forwarding .
this voice assumes Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still at an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voices of MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ Bit@@ - ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA is not a complete language dispens@@ ing system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival creates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German texts Di@@ phone . further information can be found under .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files will not be installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , but in the directory festival / li@@ b / . tut@@ orials can be found at

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allowing management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu bar contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured properly , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device actually displays and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed for installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by matching the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index . when starting the Network Set@@ ting , this will automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and release status . selecting non @-@ re @-@ poll@@ s allows setting the definition permanently . when the network settings are started , then this selection is automatically pres@@ et .
changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed grey , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . click the button System Pre@@ view mode at the lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available , divided into three tabs :
the network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interface :
the settings displayed on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... to be edited in the Device dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options .
the Automati@@ cally sel@@ ects the TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are executed with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
the manual can be used to specify the TCP / IP configuration without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be checked .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . by ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or turned off as needed . power @-@ on of an out@@ dated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
network devices can be turned on or off if required . dis@@ ab@@ ling an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and de@@ activating the interface ....
specifies the host IP address in the local sub@@ net which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a host with DNS support replaces a complete domain request by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator is a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be re @-@ arranged by selecting an entry and execution or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ ds or Her@@ underneath in the priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group hosts to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator for name resolution select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will be displayed in the Edit dialog .
the list of names in particular describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily on bo@@ oting if there are no DNS servers available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list of names in particular contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some specific IPv@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP still under review will replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... The Add New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known machine has several alias names , press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry from a name by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Def@@ ect Calcul@@ ator will be shown .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Set@@ ting module are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the Homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t is installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended only for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ The following commands should do so .
in the first section of this chapter you will find important information about basic network technology , and in the second chapter all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ configur@@ ing configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 6 has never found much dis@@ semination . IPv@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in other networks , at the &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the point of contact that allows a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up a separate small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks we usually use addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) .
the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 net address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to your own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is a different content than specified there in case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . a different stand than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which additionally offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective loading . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
before a tape can be used it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ trains the tape and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; dat ; do not recognise the pre @-@ tension@@ er on the tape , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
recognis@@ es &amp; dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ er , searches for the appropriate index on your plate . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was mounted . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be brow@@ sed by opening the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; dat ; due to a change in the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been loos@@ ened and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape must be format@@ ted before you can use it to store data . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting a tape before using it , this must happen before you can format the tape . floppy tape drives normally require format@@ ting the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape away . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically mounted and ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
ri@@ ght@@ click the local file tree and select Save In the Save ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog box opens . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear Backup . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the item item to check ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog for Veri@@ fication appears . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the check .
if you have confirmed the verification settings , the dialog will appear Vali@@ date . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the Rest@@ ore menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the Rest@@ ore dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the index file based on the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index in two ways :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located in the same file system are backed up as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
perform incre@@ mental backup . to find out which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; dat ; before the tape is embedded the command mt load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the throw at the tape drive . possibly this option does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when solving &amp; k@@ dat , automatically e@@ ject the tape . do not use this option with floppy disks .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you have to communicate the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is machine name : seconds , whereby the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the rest of the files on the tape are tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; -@@ tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this icon is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Lo@@ gs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; attempts to provide advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for sy@@ slo@@ g server format and sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides functions for easy filtering and sorting of the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - is not displayed , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not started with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or entered strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed , so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter . then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter term is contained in one of the columns .
of course , you can also select another entry in this place . for example , in the Log File System Protocol , select the process column . for example , in the Log File System Protocol , select the Process column , and also enter the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines that were sent and / or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . log @-@ lines of level Error are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as minutes lines of the level critic . the colored representation of minutes lines can be disabled in the setup dialog .
if you only want to show a specific process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new log lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to view multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for controlling program start @-@ up when running the system in &amp; Linux ; world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about this myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V In@@ it without having to re @-@ install and re@@ format it . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it has been removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole bunch of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service you want to start when you start the system or when you switch to another running level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial that is started only once .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port at startup .
the kernel searches for the in@@ it program at different places and starts the first one he finds .
the default runtime is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the beginning :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level is 3 . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you can repair it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server running level that only lets ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; run . in addition , I could also have a user -@@ run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or any other pointing device is simple in order not to say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to launch it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move the scripts between the level or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . the entry will be removed from its original Run@@ time ( or its position ) . this does not happen only if they extract an entry from the field of available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sor@@ ter numbers of the entries , before you can try to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the different work areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired runtime by inser@@ ting it ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the Input key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . Pre@@ ferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , it is restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard running level@@ es , and now the machine starts constantly anew . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ time to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplifies the configuration of the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check that all configuration files are present that are needed by the system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the running level so that it can be added to this manual .
this documentation applies to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user .
after you make changes , you must save it . either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu .
the main window consists of two file cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group by double @-@ clicking on the entry . it appears the user / group properties dialog .
some flash@@ cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled wild@@ card restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users will create a map file on which you can make individual settings . other card cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the Password Management card appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if for at least one native fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , the limitations of the space in KB are :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with space limitation using the field file system .
the card group informs groups about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs , can be found in the Field Prim@@ ular Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group &apos;s Di@@ alogue features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Bo@@ iler , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
