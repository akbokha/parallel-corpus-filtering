<seg id="1">"" "the module" "" "Website" "" "can be found in the" "" "Conqueror" "" "menu under Extras Website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list." ""</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Automatic translation is very rudimentary. babelfish produces a rough translation and, in the worst case, nonsense. therefore, the translations don't make any important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Other texts should be translated to the Babelfish site itself, where you can insert texts to be translated directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about using & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings extensions.... Open the box tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard installation modules from the kde; addons. please note that more modules may be installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; it contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on Conqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Angle Filter (also called folder filters) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Angle Filter. with this module you can filter & konqueror; the current working directory can be filtered in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM Tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentItem, all other nodes are sub-elements of this node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view of objects with the MIME content inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative to the various icon and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; it consists of graphically representing nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then, can be easily detected if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore & FSView; as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX ® command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap image is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color coding and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (whereby display errors occur by limitations on the mark of the Treemap). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With performance algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be complied with, that the area is proportionally related to the size of the entry. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of entries, and those boxes need space that is no longer available for subordinate entries. note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How distribution of the area of an entry is done for the subordinate entries is up to the implementation. here it is necessary to divide the areas so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive duplication.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimally displayed area for an entry via the menu item View stop at area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Picture Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras Image Gallery... or by Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you open the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens, with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option Show images per line has a slider and a rotational field to set the number of thumbnails in each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">Use the file name of the image to see if the filenames are displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the check box file size of the image, you specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">View the image size check box to see if the size of the images is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the folder dialog you specify where the gallery will be saved and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save In HTML file selection, enter where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can set with a slider or a control panel, until which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">If you want to copy the original pictures to the gallery, you will be able to copy the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comment file check box, you can specify a comment file for caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Window Navigation Pane or with the keyboard shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Browser Detection adds a menu entry in the & konqueror, which allows you to change the browser and operating system identifiers for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of the & konqueror is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatibel; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change the browser detection into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that deny access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser identifier to get access by the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not comply with the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes, are displayed correctly with the identifier of this obsolete browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">This option uses the set browser detection for all pages of the site you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the amount of information about the browser used and the operating system in detail.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; -Documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Check the module website in the & konqueror; check the menu on Tools Website. you can check the following tests:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; checking test whether your & HTML; -document of the syntax of & HTML; corresponding to all found errors will be displayed. with this test, you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to review your & CSS; style sheets that are embedded in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; -document. with valid & CSS; your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Checks the links on your page on forwarding and faulty shortcuts. recursively, all links on the website are checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you specify the addresses of the servers for checking your & HTML; -documents and & CSS; style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">Using the Web Archiving module for & konqueror, you can save web pages with text and images in .html format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Click on Tools Website with the mouse and a dialog appears to save the displayed web page.</seg>
<seg id="54">The Web Archiving module is copyright and copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlapbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik spbch @ iam.unibe.ch larossa @ kde.org painted @ kde.org</seg>
<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digiplug; albums can download. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicode; working together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicode; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE image plug-in interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam, it is easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in the 16 bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion by means of libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report any problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& nbsp; When you are in the program, the Help menu provides an entry to report problems or requests.... This opens a dialog with an underlined linking. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error report system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digicode; is a project that is supported by a community. that means that the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to ask you to answer questions about other users of & digikam. however, you may soon answer yourself questions from other users. however, in this mailing list English is spoken, you should therefore be proficient in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also edit the digiplug; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digicode; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digikam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. guidance for signing up in the developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & edit; for the first time, you will be asked where to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data will be saved. this path will remain the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & digikam; will additionally use as an Albenbibliothek. settings digiKam setup collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder. & digikam; consider each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digiplug; duringly recursively the library path in its full depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders, unless it is in hidden folder. you can do this by inserting one point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist do not have any photos as icons. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keyword iste to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw-mode of your camera, you can handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a specific camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-Decoder2 and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digiplug; albums can download. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicode; working together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). the camera is then used as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiplug; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributable software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and are slow via the serial port, this connection is now outdated. & digicode; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails from digiKam. the Exif support is required by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the thumbnails. if the exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you might be unable to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the nicest things in & digitio; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE image plug-in Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenge. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in almost any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digikam; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes came into & digicode; self-accomplishment.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and dropping pictures works anywhere: you can store a picture in another part of the Albentree, over the horizontal partition line or into another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields displayed in the toolbar at present. this way, the filter will only work on the filename when this is shown in the symbol view. what fields are displayed can be configured in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albeni & quot; provides an organized view to your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the album characteristics or after the date on which the album was created first.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method to select your albums to be grouped under a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos when you select from the tool bar or sort albums After collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the collections settings.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Night- Date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by sorting date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elder, average, New Year: these set the date to that of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do so, try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file in this folder is used instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & nbsp; open, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albeni & quot; This will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview & quot; As an album preview! additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& nbsp; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My Keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures will be displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait a bit while the thumbnails are generated, so you can avoid using the Tools menu in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be shown below the corresponding preview. what information this is, you can edit via settings digiplug; set up the albums page and customize the area preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The preview images feature help windows that appear. if you let the mouse pointer rest for a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all key words of a photo. the screenshot at the top in the Introduction to the main window shows such an help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos and keywords allow you to organize your photos in a way that suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can view all the features that come with & Edit. you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or the editing of the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 Picture Editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit... you can select a tutorial on how to edit your photos. with image editing you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digiplug; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. for this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you can find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicode; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click on the preview and select rotation. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo from & Edit, it is moved into the trash bin by & kde; move. F8 Picture deletion or Del case you prefer to really delete, you can do this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumslider quot; organizes your photos based on the data. & digicode; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Tags provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords in logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My Keyword lipiquot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also re-import your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the tags are re-imported in the loss of the database as soon as & digikam; the pictures noted.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either & quot; My stitch & quot; or click on an existing cue word and then select New keyword. if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this will become the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself is not deleted. only the cue word is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting Cue Signup from the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My Keyword quot;.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, click the picture with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want to add with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My Keyword quot; drag and drop it. alternatively, you can also click on the preview of the pictures with the right mouse button and select keyword instructions from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords you assigned tags. in this way you can give a cue for each person in a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will appear in the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Keywords menu. the menu only shows the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view shows a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved through this histogram. to select a time frame, simply click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame which indicates the time unit. this will display all related images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. this will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all database elements: names, appraisals, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="125">In addition to the search box, a small lamp is the green when finding matches. if you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again. if the search has not found, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box like the one described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be performed. the results will be displayed in the Search list in the main window. the Text box Save search as used to change your request a name in My search list. if you want to change your selection again, you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select to edit search, the search form will appear with the previously entered search information. if you select to edit Advanced search, the Advanced search dialog will appear to change your previous search. see the Advanced search tool section for more information.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete Search in the Search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digicode; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the alb database. an option can be added to this list with search group / deleted, or deleted from it. each option can be associated with others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the lower the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar. by means of a swellerts the choice of results can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of unsuccessful search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hands-free sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the matching images. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab displays an intuitive map finder based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your geo filter, which will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicode; provides a lighting console in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add to the light table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the lighting console and its window will open. if you are back in the & digiplug; main window, you can quickly open the lighting console with L Extras illuminated table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview toolbar, you can drag and drop the pictures you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. if you want to synchronize the thumbnails from the toolbar and execute zoos and / or move operations on one of the images, they will also be executed with the other image.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited for quick sorting out of a series of images. when you navigate from the toolbar, the first two images will automatically be loaded into the pane. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to view it in the right pane. the image to the right is displayed in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletions work directly from the lighting console such as F4 File Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. this makes it simple to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to wave the visible area of the image, you need to click on them and hold the & LMB; in the preview mode, both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. simply use the zoom slider under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom in and out. this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos capture, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this but not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect, and use photos. we look at downloading, renaming, removing, group, archiving, optimizing, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes up, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confuses and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is according to your definition data, which provides information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need to find a specific photo for a longer time without taking stock management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you definitely don't use & digicode;. the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found across your location, unless you were in one year several times at the same place. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for images you can print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements, e.g. versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separating file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend saving the metadata option in the Settings page of the metadata; to activate it. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database to the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? to do so & digicode; provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you can now assign keywords, captions and a rating to every photo. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos while working.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's go with keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloguized images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digicode; automatically set up the tree for you or put the images to the right place. sorting the Hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digikam; updated as it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The diagram shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to inscriptions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let most of your photos just see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from a distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look closer, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you that this is the landing site of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming of having associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others viewing your photos, the title might be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the power only to work with a lettering for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & Edit, you can save as much text, in an internationalised literet (UTF-8), as labeling. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE even gives you a spelling test. if you export your images to web galleries, then these labels will not tell you a second time for the lettering and / or title of the web galery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not Earth a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? good, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is already moving with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit the geolocation are already innumerable and will become deeper in the future. I am sure that someday, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels by using images with geographic data. this then shows the photos at the location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with Google Maps Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun of copyright and denotes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies. same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information was included in the setup page of & digiplug; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photograph, e.g. to protect the photographer's name, for example to protect the photographer's name. after this value has been stored once, it should not be changed. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's job description. examples of this may be title such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the authors and copyright sections, although they have no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or modify this, in the picture embedded metadata. for individuals, this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digicode; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, disk failure, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, distributed superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on fire. these kinds of losses are the same which can also happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. this section concerns problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated carefully and you can no longer trust you for more than a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers over Gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk by using good discs and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones, but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if they have just been written. therefore, they use a control sum mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection, they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which seems to work miracles for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from corrupted disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against HD DVD. a dual player Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and therefore almost 6 times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">You should also read the media with a description, date & author, and store it in a clean, dark dry and sheltered spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks: diskette study</seg>
<seg id="187">Short: disks hold the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common error reason is that SMART is the most common error reason. SMART determines the imminent failure. some of SMART's errors are especially reading errors and publishers. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the total loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make a lot of power surges, this can cause serious damage on devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these anomalies can cause severe damage. thus, protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a portion of the energy heat and grounding the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. remember, however, that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage can use any cable to your computer, you should make sure that all peripherals connected to your system are protected as well. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection, which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a wearable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a few seconds failure can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it can be useful to invest in uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. some models allow them to even continue working until the current is running again. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with electricity disturbances with the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives home - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB of cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in case of Flickr more. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage, which should only be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transfer errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed storage. thus, they are disaster-safe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs filesystem must at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these failures remain undiscovered until one day you have to open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. no one ever seems to have thought about it. no one ever seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors are unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard (GPL). we can only hope that it is available for & Linux and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protective mechanisms that ZFS used and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the loss of data on notebooks and 46% in workstation systems. for notebooks, the percentage of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has long since been no longer spotted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the broadest file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been completely stored before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: incorrect, theft and human error are the major causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras sensors are 1-2 stops from fundamental physical borders. this means that while the technology is evolving there is a natural limit to this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so make no one responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss. thus, backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a bolt of lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">Disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget about aircraft accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole space or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means not local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighbouring house, into your office or the like.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite fuse the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time at which such a backup has been made. this backup comes closest to a versioning system with the exception that it is only scanned and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfers, rsync copies only the difference between files that have really been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the work files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, retain associated XMP files, retain original memory, scalability, media, rediscover images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So precious images will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate all the time. unfortunately, there is no other way to make a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your storage and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the print mark for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means enlarging.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume you have built the scalability with you and want to zoom in the area you want to zoom to a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record has been detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # Source is / dev / sdc # Source; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; # functions with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 #</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can use gamma and chromaticity data for enhanced color assignment for heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed format or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflates). however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a royalty-free and open-frame image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the needs of the TIFF / EP format and commits to use metadata. DNG is already available and we hope that the competitor Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive a copy of your photo, mostly in the raw format, because it can store the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when connecting the metadata file and the image file, and as noted above the raw format is old. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edit, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">You can use external programs for fine-layered processing. if you edit the images again with & Edit then you should add the metadata again. these were sometimes truncated by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them to web galleries, code to mpeg, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & edited; see Adding a Photos to an Album to find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect them to the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and turn on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. with some cameras, it may take a while. if the connection is made, a finished -indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application is displayed for each file, photos, movies, music, etc on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. the properties and metadata from the camera interface allow you to see the properties of an entry and its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata Editor displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer's note, GPS, etc. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of & Edit; or the image processing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of all. this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired ones using the standard selection methods by & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the button Selected will be grayed out until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these images have not been downloaded until now. in this case, the new images are selected with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using all the download buttons or download selected folders, a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums in section My Albums tab. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the photos you want, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once, by deleting the Delete Delete button. if you just want to delete some, you must select them first and then delete selected delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera. the photos will not be moved to the trash bin by & kde; they should be carefully checked, before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do this via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use often not particularly meaningful names for the photos. the file names are normally used again after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate files if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically each day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options that will be executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two will affect the author's data in the section Standard Car Identity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the default format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field. turn on the date & time option. for further adjustments, you should read strftime using the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filename option, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase, or uppercase if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & Edit, is used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& nbsp; You can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point recording to perform an automatic rotation during downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually turned on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, you let & digiplug; the photo in its original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available & edited; this is used to automatically download sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off and then saved & edited; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to their camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, you ask & digiplug; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser to indicate the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & edited; users who want to locate a postcard, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitelites and map references. the question is actually more about how the data enter these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of the GPS data and picture files with the KIPI module for geographical classification (manual) and last via manual input of known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save this data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical classification.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS which can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script, which works with the ExifTool from Phil Harvey. it uses the signs with hairy coordinates created, for example, by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicode; tries to give you as much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that modify the behavior of & Edit. to access these settings, you need to set up in the Settings menu; set up. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select Action can be displayed on Embedded preview or start image processing. you specify the default behavior of & Edit when you click on an entry in the main screen.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the identity and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the author: this field should contain the photographer's job title. this can be labels like photographer, freelance photographer or independent professional photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for provider: use this field to indicate the name of the photo. this does not have to be the author, if this is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture of others & quot; offering quot;. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC fieldset. this ensures that metadata is permanently contained in the image, and not only in the database of & digicode; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported and imported without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image identifications as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos with the labels embedded in the pictures. note: in pictures that already contain captions, they will be overwritten by the Edit.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer is in the main window above a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digicode; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digicode; attempts, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire of & digiplug; can be set on this page to the default values. each time you open the lighting console, these settings will be switched on. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With chroma-subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG-compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality, since PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF-Files option you can activate the default image compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality as the Deflates algorithm works without any loss.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not been supported yet, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & Editing, image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is quickly becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image processing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default assumption is that all green pixels are equal. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels of odd rows, this difference creates a grid pattern in output. this option marks the picture a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNC or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if white balance is not set. standard it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the peak lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the peak lights, so the parts of your images that are burned out, due to the inability of your camera to look at the pointed lights, as a continuous white. use this setting to resolve some unusual results, as it displays the pointed lights in various rose tones. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of missing information from the valorists.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstructing option, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be adapted individually for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & nbsp; -image processing. to keep the time for the Demosaunch small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which a matrix of coloured pixels is available. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicode; and Dcraw provide three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests, it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenated Directed) created the quality for me and the paper used by me. VNG interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color grading since you are done during the rough conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to return it. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information such as the color information from a color space to translate into the other are the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Sets the folder here, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digiplug; examine this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC Profiles You have here the option & quot; standard squot; to deposit for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures colored not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not have a color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not fix for conversions at 16 bit depths. this means that you do not have to do the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile that allows you to emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print a picture because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could manually correct you instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for. unfortunately not on the models of Canon. therefore here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is naturally inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface & digicode; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will then be loaded by & Edit. these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu in the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules, you can get the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the picture transitions, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">On the right-hand side there is a button Automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the image display mode. underneath are the port settings. currently there are serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field will only be active if you have a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / s, where you hang your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & Edit; the camera automatically recognizes. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the Camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will be displayed in the main window's menu. if you have more than one camera, you can insert them all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option Confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the trashcan you can adjust the readability of & digicode; when deleting a photo in an album, you will find further details in the sections deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be used silently by & digiplug; if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any callbacks. otherwise you need to save the changes using the button Changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also edit the display of the Welcome screen from & Edit, stopping at startup. this may, in some cases, accelerate the start-up of & Edit;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting At start after new photos is forcing & digikam to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & nbsp;. if something has been deleted from the base folder, & nbsp; you know if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & nbsp; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicode; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting the Ad / Editing item.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digicode; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see Setting up the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below it toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You may need to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using Recover from the File menu or using the button The Restore the Image Processing Restore in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every image processing action can be undone or restored. you can undo the last action by restoring or restoring back and / or restoring back from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the return button or Restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the editing, you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you Ctrl, mouse wheel, or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Saver displays the picture in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, you can change this in the Settings dialog from & Edit. this can be changed from the Edit menu. see the section to set up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select Print image in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. entire image snippets can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the default methods and select Export job supervisor from the Album Export menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & nbsp; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation files, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge again.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can enter or insert lettering with unlimited size. note that the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should follow these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">Once you have commented on it, either use the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, then the labels will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the Application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting which is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the Regency IPTC field, following the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword overview shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree, and a chooser box with previously used keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate checkboxes in the tree. all key words of an image are stored in the IPTC array keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want to add a sample with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword filter page is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - date, keyword and search views. if one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all generated keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main screen to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and filed there. a dialogue asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable variance from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color management, then everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results they want. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (for more information see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are via e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another colour space and thus have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to sound my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in the sRGB color space or not, you have to sound your monitor, since sRGB is flashing on sRGB. if you're working in sRGB color space, you must either sound your monitor to the sRGB standard, use an appropriate monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore use it before attempting to manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Compensation and Contrast enlarge from the Correcline Automatic correction menu try automatically to make the most of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparison: this method adjusts the intensity factor of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. it sometimes produces very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic compensation: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects dark and bright borders and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Extend contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new jibe of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited because there is a color space with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which operates in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will fall better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. previewing will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel in this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the top right there is a histogram that is changed dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether any of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your results depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow readjustment lets you improve or down the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then click anywhere on the image preview to use the color chosen for calculation of the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values will also be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. any setting of the white balance you have set allows you to store it in a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button reverts all the filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture as your original. if you save these settings, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding also needs more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide to use color profiles lets you consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to use them for multiple photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner will always make the same mistake and therefore you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under Colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & nbsp; tool color effects provides four color effects, a solar radiation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar polarization, also called sabatier, was an effect that emerged when one exposed a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and subsequently inverted the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light. the result was a partial negation of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar polarization. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further boost finally creates a negative image that is not produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and that works the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called "Velviaquire" effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a colour film which is optimized in daylight by Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers. Velvias strongly saturated colors are too much for some photographers, especially those who do not agree with landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos. you can look at the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you only need the range of the sliders for the application purpose described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into them and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">The original and preview of the image can be viewed on the right. the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pins can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and Load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and later loaded again, using Gimp Levels format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, remedies and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option ÜberCharge indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side shows half of the original and the target image. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">A red marker is visible on the preview of the original photo. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line appears on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all the channels of shadow, mid- and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixers of the & digikam; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color hue of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer of Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left part of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: red, green and construction controls allow you to mix these channels. if you want to retain luminance, the picture will retain the general brightness as well, as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space. tinting consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that's the case you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option ÜberCharge indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original picture can be seen under (1) and the processed picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP 5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic light effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at daytime. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) rotary filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepithaton: produces warm and medium tones as it adds a bit of coldness in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and the re-development in a seepatonic. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the Edit Tool texture you can apply decorative textures to one image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shifting this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or the three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the changed under (2) to be seen. the relief model has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the Edit Toolbox, a decorative frame can be added to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a spectator in the bounds of a photograph is not an easy task. it is a possibility to keep his attention. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under the picture frame the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture. continuous surround the picture with a colored line, niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), kantet surrounds it with a nice 3 dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adding a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The finish image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the images, especially if you have used the tool According to aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture at any position. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. you will simply choose a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the Edit Toolkit you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu used in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and use maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the & digiplug; stencil data base, just send an email in English to the & digikam, mailing list digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your Schablonenfolder with the button base folder in dialog. select the folder where you copied the stencil files. these settings will be marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the stencil. selecting a folder automatically refreshes the template's thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge This button magnifies the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the entire image, you have to resize the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the image and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other fields.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates grainy images, especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurfe mask works on the contrast of the edges to make an image sharper. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright of Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitized images require correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn means that sharp edges become a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, have to be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of sharpness during reading the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening workpiece. you can use the menu entry to invoke Correct Archiving.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should handle this carefully as the results do not work very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpen it. use the tool for softness with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Unsharp masking filter is a very good tool to remove loopers from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview will help to edit the image. the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount intensifies the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and the impression of grats will produce close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius indicates how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. therefore, they should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. this sets the percentage of focus.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference-amount. thus, one can define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharper and therefore flaw mistakes in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">The original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred is applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocused a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyrighted design filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is using a blurred mask. refocus achieves usually better results than blurred masking. you can start it from the menu by using colors refocus in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixles that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauß's folding is actually very strongly influenced by the distant pixels, causing undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular Sharpe: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred then pay attention to haloons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0,5 and the values are equal to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. the filter can take values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß 'edge. use this parameter if your blur is Gauß'. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular hot or the Gauß 'edge. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameter that you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much surgery changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masking must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never have the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture that has to be corrected. this image has been made using an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for the sharpening of digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider smoothes the blur of the area of the darkened area in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows for an adapted colour for the pupils. if you want blue eyes rather than dark ones, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">Tool error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Insert algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more smoothly, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to uniform flattens over the picture. whereas larger values mainly smoothe homogeneous regions and let details be sharp. a value of 0.9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, whereas a value close to 1 can only be smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD sound, a high value will produce wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value matching to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulbar effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is run. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient here.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step-width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be selected as small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value below 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more in quality you receive by selecting this option is only low. however, it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons make this. correcting any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very quick at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Abort.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected using small artefacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a strange black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad film deposit during the trip. the original picture is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digiplug; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned pictures from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on sensor noise of digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">The radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and can blur the image. the range specified by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor bugs fixed.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to determine light density changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer be maintained and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise cannot be removed or roughnesses can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolera of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas that are typically more ruffled. however, it also allocates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius will react to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, noise and phase jitter appear at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than to sharpen an image. use tool for softness with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitised pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labs in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons make this exactly. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very quick at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniformity noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (tm) 700i camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures are reduced to an old color photo that has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts created by scanner backlight and photo paper. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows hotspots to be removed from photos taken with a CCD camera gem. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel & quot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark photo extraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the button darker. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to connect the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard shows the last dark picture and will automatically load this in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you correct the result inside the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear interface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compute a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic corners (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image can be seen in (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digiplug; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not uniformly illuminate the entire sensor area. instead, they vignetting them the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 with aperture filter, which may increase the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to keep the camera manually. wide angle lenses should also use center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise unsharper effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's felt and color or gray scale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls you can control the Vignetting correction filter and three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density in the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which compensates for an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the luminous intensity of the pixels. you need to readjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more subtle re-adjustment of the exposure of the target image, let the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction applied to one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a correction and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplug; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grades corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second grades. with negative values, tonal distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth. this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lentils, the 'Corner parameter has the inverse character of the General parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resumes the image size and thereby corrects a correction of the first grades. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the Preview dialog displays the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The sound or cushion-shaped correction should be performed prior to any cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as first. if you want to re-cut an image and then perform a sound-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the falsification.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal aid line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea border or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the toning / cushion distortion with the help of lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black edges. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Edit Settings menu or from the Zoom Control dialog of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tone-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture can be seen under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-red movie of the GimpGuru.org website which is reachable under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for movie granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Fame film grains if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulators change the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels for reproducing infrared films, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2) to see. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind aura in the peak lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">This is known from classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the movies the manufacturers mix large silver baskets of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grained effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image acquires a timeless atmosphere loose from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value, although frequently higher values are required, is set to ISO 2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter more than once.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grading effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & nbsp; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">& nbsp; This oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing checks the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the working is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digiplug; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. pictures whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob adjusts the pin size and the lower knob adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digiplug; filter engraving patterns your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">It works especially well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtration. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortions effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed through blocks of glass.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the picture here is distorted with another version of blocks of glass.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Infinity: blurring the image along starshaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates blurring a zooming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Sharpness: blurring the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring blurring: blurring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: taken from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softness: blurring the image softly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness-sharpness: blurring the image by means of a random shift of the pixels and thus simulates the sharpness of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent sharpness: finds the color paddling in the picture and blurring it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it, by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the terminating button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of the drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digiplug; image processing to keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter regentrop, the area will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original picture (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the correct orientation by mirrors or turning. the tools can be found in the Edit Rotor or Transforming mirrors menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image if the boundaries of the resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the size change tool. select to change the size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulbar effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. enlarging each image for Photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast in what it does, but it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the terminating button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to twice the size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. image processing allows this very easy. to trim a photo you just need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle, you will then see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut out. this will give you a good overview of how your photo will look after cropping. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle will be created by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cutting button of image editing on the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the save file save or save file from the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool According to aspect ratio is used a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inch or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool According to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are saved as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The placement aid settings allow you to show help in order to better put together your pictures. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious splits are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-leg rule, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden divide is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden divide at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden centre. a composition which follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides more liquid aid lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you good results to your goal for your photos. in comparison to third-level rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition results in the gaze of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye may be in the center of the composition. it can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spirals discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamical symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition which you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirrors and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic partitioning.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it easily happens that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture where things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & Edit; image processing and tool free rotation. choose Transforming Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slide are given in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees again. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse into the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have turned a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transforming cropping from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the Automatically cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. however, keep in mind the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New Height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly smeared. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations create twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the image with transforming dissection from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The locking tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. for example, the upper part of the image is shifted to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a right angle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shear your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are set to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">Move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single shear this effect is usually negligible, but two lines generating twice as much wiping and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the image has unattractive triangular holes in the corners. a way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming dissection from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicode; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the formats available are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, of the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with & digicode.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency from other libraries it is impossible to provide a list of all file formats available on its system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats that you know. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, you can edit the file in the image editing. you can change this list of file extensions, and change it. in the configuration section, you will find more information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000s can also store lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, see Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF to the Image Converter by & Edit. in the Configuration section, you can find further information on how to use modules with & digicode;.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to do the photo editing are included in & digicode; your description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, soft marks, noise reduction, refocusing, unsharp masking, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; Texture applied & quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image. on the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">The left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally divided without duplicates. the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane.</seg>

<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The Properties page displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo features: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data come from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab displays an intuitive map finder based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used for editing color palettes and selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The pallets files that are installed by & kde can apply either to the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your Personal folder for & kde; -settings and hot user defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the Palette, you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed as a line in the Pallet view. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">It shows the color next to it. the color is described under the Pallet view. here, too, the color name can be changed.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphic viewer; is a KDE program used to view & graphviz; -dot; graphs; graphs; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that include & graphviz are outdated & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphic viewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& knetviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graph. die & graphviz; -programs are free layout programs. & kgraphic viewer; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; the graphene is recalculated and in & kgraphic viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; to open or to open the graph in & kgraphic viewer; in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Other required software: & kgraphic viewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; tools & dot; for representation of graphs. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in a separate subwindow. initially, when you start & knetviewer; without an argument, the main window is empty as shown in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the File icon and the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the Open dialog.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or choose this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; -button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum size reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file currently loaded in & knetviewer; loaded file has been changed from another program, the following window appears:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether to recharge the graph or whether you want to ignore the change. & knetviewer; you can also note your decision, so that later it will also process. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kgraphic viewer; set..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph file outside a running & kgraphic viewer; -instance open, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphic viewer; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but this can also be changed with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At the start of the program you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both save and change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on one page will be clicked on this page. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graphs distributed over several pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Upload page gives you the option to set the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore changes) or ask the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open page gives the option to set the behavior of & kgraphic viewer; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that every time it is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session administration page gives you the possibility to set the start behavior of & kgraphic viewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session) or decide to be asked for each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu that usually appears with a click in the main window with the & RMBn opens up additional options:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphiviz; layout algorithms. the entries described on the webpage of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graph. it produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directed graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the default for ungerized graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springspring model layout for ungerized graphs. it uses the fruit-man-pure gold-heuristic, and includes a multi-grid catalyst for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes in a circular way according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and the calculated layout of the graph will output to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms to change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of the graph (directed or unexecuted) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for ungrounded graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read pictures from a scanner supported by the Sane project or another source such as video streams. to make this work you need to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item images, a dialog appears that allows you to select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by changing the default setting of your own to select your image accordingly. see the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image with the button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have clicked the button, you will have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target image appears. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected import / screen shot in the menu. a window appears where you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have read the complete Desktop, only the window is read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you have to switch to other work areas, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made the dialog box appears with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr makes it possible to send his photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos in the world, place photos of your camera shop online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export to Flickr module can be used to upload pictures from your computer to Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. therefore, it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr Website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the Export to Flickr module is launched for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog which displays the current permissions that the module displays. to upload, you need write permissions. the module currently does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to proceed with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add Photos should be pressed once you have placed all other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button, the upload of the photos to Flickr server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords Field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends and Famillie you can set the permissions on your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option to change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed in size before uploading. the size is taken from the value added to maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI Module Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module Galerie-Export has no documentation currently. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images geographically within the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographic localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call up the menu. the above-to-see dialog appears. to make a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data recorded at the same time at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have the right data. if you know that in reality a location is in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region and magnify it again and again until you have reached sufficient accuracy. the height must always be manually selected. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to mount the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module Image Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the charset is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The panel has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the panel selection allows you to select all albums that are exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the album preview and the text appearing in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page opens in which the picture is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Dexterity show, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG image format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with Other color depth, which naturally also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Rider preview pictures allow you to customize some of the settings from the album Rider for the thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will be automatically started to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown as default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows for the actions below to save images in JPEG format without the usual loss of quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client module is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has no documentation currently. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailinglist kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the Metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write to any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please take a look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoding module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV encoder.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can choose a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD Player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. after that, you can launch the module using Tools MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be chosen from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to playback the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. the name and path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG output file. if so, keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start coding the production of the movie with the knob code. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or quietly drink a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that coding or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the Settings button below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows printing several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photosizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened using image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF, or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amp can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename stays the same and only the extension will be modified accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise continue to use them otherwise, you shouldn't select the JPEG format, because it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing at a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing files. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images on an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images in a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can resize or enlarge the image. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: no proportional scale change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Prepress: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent previously.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected. by adding pictures you can add more images with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop pictures to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the Delete button, the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. you only need to add the addresses and the subject here. the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Be careful not to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to send. it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the pictures are put together into a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Pictures File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend you JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in images of file format and the original JPEG files are in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. by closing the button, you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diaschau module, a window will appear with questions about how to display your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL output option in the presentation uses very elegant image transitions with OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">Show the filename option for displaying the filename of the images in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The Loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually interrupt it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option Show pictures randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance will depend on your computer and the chosen transitional effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. random selects another effect at every transition between images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left corner of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar, you can stop and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and next picture and stop slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the lower edge of the screen you can see the current filename, position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation currently. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can use & kphotoalbum; Browse through these pictures, see the picture. as you can see by a comparison with the picture, there are now entries in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with comments. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to view the current preview images. in the following, each is described for each other.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse with the mouse, the view of the browser will change. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you select another person only the images are displayed on which both persons are visible. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can display with thumbnails to view the images of your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same icon in front of her name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however for each person to save his own thumbnail, this also applies to locations, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the picture below.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must, however, specify which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you have to select the image view window (described in more detail) and select the image for the respective person in the context menu. here you can customize the image for the respective person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your preferences and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you access the search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties. this dialog can be viewed again in the image.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the lettering or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. click here for pictures depicting Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for the photoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the Home & Photo Album's Homepage; and take a look at the quick entry, screenshots and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & Photo Album; and in the first dialog select the demo if you start & photo album; for the first time, or select the menu item cphotoalbum; -demo in the menu. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of the photoalbum; try it out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the Homepage of & Photo Album; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time line can show you several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview pane) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timestamps. if you select an area, in the preview view only pictures of this time period will be displayed. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& Photo Album; provides two ways to create html web pages with your pictures. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the one is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can access via the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the title and a description to include the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; -export file should be created on the overview page. more information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed without a description. for example, that all pictures are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unambiguous, which is why it is not specifically discussed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures. this allows those who view your web page and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images that have, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so he can search your images with a low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time. if he wants to get an image bigger he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to select a basic folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the root folder where all your images are stored. this folder is stored and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these really are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will start after the pages are created. the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you create are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. in order for the import function, see, correctly you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that are just described have all three related to base folders and URLs. in these folders, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & Photo Album; coming together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to go with & Photo Album; this work will not make even more.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & Photo Album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if only a link to pictures is stored in the file. the advantage of saving all pictures into the file is that you have all pictures together and that this file can be passed so independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File Exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the file of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is the dialog for exporting images that you can view through the File Exporting menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the manual copy option to the .kim file, copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy to the .kim file copy & colphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is Maximum image size limit. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image is at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import menu... select the & Photo Album; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard to import consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the importing images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is in your database. therefore, in the third dialog box you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported should be imported and which categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: when you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups. if you want to see pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) setting the information about your images, via (2) searching and viewing, through to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your images, but it has been extended and today it will also take care of your videos. in many places in this manual you will talk about pictures, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& Photo Album; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& Photo Album; memorize the folder where your images are stored and automatically use it in future Starts. if you want to read another folder tree with pictures, you can start with the -c option. for example: photo album -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu item Settings kphotoalbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & Photo Album; in the following section of the User Manual the different settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left, you will see six different icons that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which can be activated by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described to you how to set different properties for each picture, for example people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog which is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and icon.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the Options section, subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete members groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, rather than all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">See the settings options available to you for setting the member groups. with the drop-down list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window you can find a list of the current categories and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& Photo Album; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenpreview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plug-in Interface. more information can be found on the website of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">Modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; they are not part of & Photo Album; however, most modules have a help page, which you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are shared by multiple applications among themselves, it may be that the modules are tested with & Photo Album; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using this on your own pictures. demo database can be used either through the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications record their images in albums: this is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order does not support, it simulates order for some modules the order for albums so that you can use the functions with & Photo Album.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, i.e. all the images that show you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & photo album, the modules also have to pass a list of albums.</seg>
<seg id="964">When & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category that you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category persons, you will do this, so do so, so if you have selected persons to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & Photo Album are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select which modules should be loaded in the module section.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you see an example of a start screen when you start & Photo Album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar, you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. currently, it does not contain a lot of information, as you do not yet have information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of the photoalbum is the possibility to annotate every picture with annotations. this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture, where the picture has been taken, etc. you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text field by setting up people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & Photo Album; as you will always use them again whenever you type information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are mapped, you can, by moving the names used up, find the persons faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetically sorted list, click on the Sorting icon after date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image separately, you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with annotations. in this case simply click on the front and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the image you see a browser window showing the USA as a hypergroup. to show you that it is a hypergroup, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the comment dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it a subcategory of this item. note, this assumes you are sorting exactly your categories in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and dragging the bar to form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... which, among other things, offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide the window. see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the image view in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or all images if you do not have a filter. for example, see here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails by simply pressing the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, it will appear in the image viewer. if you do not open a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the delete button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now the window appears that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& Photo Album; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely images also without you saved on the hard disk. of course you have to have the pictures stored somewhere to make & photo album; you can see the view of & Photo Album; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, the thumbnails are present, so & kphotoalbum; you can view these images as well. however, you cannot view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy them back again. & Photo Album; does not yet support you to ask for the insertion of the respective CD. so if you want to avoid anger, such as messing up your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, filter the images in such a way that at the end those you want to disable for others, and click Actual View lock in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also select all the images that your little sister may see and block the menu item All except the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to set which images to be hidden in case of the case. if you want to put the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item images to lock, whereby all the images you have locked will fade out. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click Locking.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select Change Password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this kind of password protection only serves to denavert the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you can manage all your pictures with & Photo Album; manage and spend hours about hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & Photo Album; over an image _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he shows, of course, the image, but additional all the information you have entered via the image, such as who is on the image, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it elsewhere. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser will show you matching entries to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all images of Anne Helene. as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you load multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the Picture High and Picture function. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as a slide show. & Photo Album; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often a new image can load can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & Photo Album; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can zoom in and out into the image. with the mouse button you can pull a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus button you can zoom out again. the Plus button zooms in in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and displays the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the uniformity key uses the zoom, so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are disabled and zoom in and out.</seg>
<seg id="1003">The screenshot from the context menu allows you to rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments to the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at pictures it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can cancel the image and open configuration dialog of the image to enter these names. however, you may prefer to only select the image and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while watching one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer has the possibility to provide images with features while watching them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the corresponding letter. in this picture you see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, they are available in your browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print, or whatever you have selected, then simply place them all at once with notes. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you display categories in a thumbnail view then you can add features to the images by simply press the letter for the feature after the image has been selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you allow you to paint photo album; on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. on the way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to turn on the painting mode of & Photo Album; to turn on the painting mode from the context menu. to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation on & Povray; you should have read and understood absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire frame views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu appears, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Delete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or discard the changes with abortion.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object by means of help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the properties view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default the entire texture is rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), check locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a point of view as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window arrangement, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set them arbitrarily. you can also save multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below an existing view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle will display the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the Beggar in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are hovering views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the Beggar to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the beginning bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the beginning bar. to prevent closing, click the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any position.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View Window order... Save. a dialog will appear where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 is current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on Rendering icon The icon Rendering in the toolbar or select the Rendering Procedure menu.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a fast preview up to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">When you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in View Render modes... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you see the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image detail for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Quality combination field you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render characteristics can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, computes and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling refers to neighboring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because every pixel is split up and adapted again and again because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray uses a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are followed individually and checked for further subdivision. you can adjust the maximum depth of the recursion with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the Import menu item... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command range of & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste into & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the properties view opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User documentation to the displayed object. here, set the path to your document and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height data) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type number plate.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points onto the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. here, you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross High level of attention for extended projections, all wire models views will be further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property results in a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the floor, a bottom is rendered under the objects. the bottom is represented in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used to render the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. in more detail about the parameters, see the Render modes section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the Window Panels section it explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination box Standard window arrangement: displays all existing window classifications. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The Add Window Panels show all existing window configurations. a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement using the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. new column opens a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you get a map card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should follow these warnings carefully before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should follow these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeling; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and existing icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and icons now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">To follow this tutorial, first you have to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select Edit Delete. then you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which you can find the different parameters of the camera. in the user documentation to & Povray; see more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything in the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When using the Apply button or the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert Endress Body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look closely at the object tree, you will find that you can unfold the item for the floor by clicking on the + before the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the horizon a unit under the horizon line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select translation and set the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, in which you can select how to insert the object. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material, because you have to type settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with one click on the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the header and ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then click the Preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you want to render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Each time, select the color in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be done simply because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeling; the ball can be just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the Enter key or button Apply), so the ball will float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now gives a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign it a material. as with the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First sub-object and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on Ball Pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces even if Metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you modeled for you. hopefully, you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the renderer is shooting hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through every pixel in the scene. the render computes the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene you want to be rendered needs some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest item in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last undo command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit backend.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or override an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, keyboard shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to set pre-set short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for the creation of toolbars. with this option you can add tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis, by applying a picture file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser where you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the image size or full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; it is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display with the click of the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>

Select the & Amarok; -specific keyboard shortcuts you can set by right-click in the player window and select shortcuts... Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may set up any existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as & Amarok; -short commands. by doing so you make your keyboard to & Amarok; Control Center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, most of which are also found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; Amarok also has some of its own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use kdialog so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'corundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. to do so, strings are written to the default input of the script. for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weices the script to display the setup dialog. to store and store the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok will set the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange Shows that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions more information about the new piece may be retrieved (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemtitle controls the path to the selected files in the playlist, when a custom menu entry is clicked. to remove the menu one can use the dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemtitle). to remove an entry, use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemtitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do e.g. clearing work. this includes, for example, saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.bz2) which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Erkuokscript extension. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">When your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page by & Amarok. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde; & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you're just looking for a certain item of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collecting Browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Perhaps you already have some playlists but can never decide which ones you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just right for you. and if the decision is still difficult, the dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used, so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. these and many other useful features make Amarok the most advanced audio player.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the basic folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake are used if you don't have any problems when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailinglists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, it has some options to enable or disable the compile-time point using the configure script. this is a list of options available.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compiler options certain dependencies must be met so that they can be used. see the System Requirements section for details.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging icons. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without effort across the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several box cards to set up the various features of & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1214">External Browser: lets you choose which browser of & Amarok; to start when a browser is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save Playlist when you exit, automatically saves the current playlist when you exit & Amarok; check this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist while you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">To keep the current piece visible when changing the parts causes the playlist window to roll up / unroll in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing the part to the context browser, the context browser automatically displays when the next play is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section, you can customize & Amarok's appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the Fonts section, you can set the usage of various fonts in & Amarok; use the otherwise gray displayed section. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, player windows and context browser. press Choose..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the Custom color scheme you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selections that are enabled for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Continue playback at the start that & Amarok; after program start resume play automatically with the piece at the spot with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the On-Screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. when on-screen display is checked, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select the font for the OSD from the dialog. the shadow of the shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD colors for fonts and background. clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for selecting colors. if your own colors are not activated, the default & kde colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below is a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users. this allows you to specify the screen of a multi-screen environment to appear on the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The map audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box. some drivers still activate additional settings in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection, including the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders, the & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Recursively Browse sub-folders: this causes & Amarok; Browse the interfolders as well as their subfolders to music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allow & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). an incremental search is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: add & Amarok; add all the playlists found in your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will later appear in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the drop down selector driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is required in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql device section will be used to set up the database for & Amarok. on Calculator: enter the machine on which the MySql database is located. then, under Port: the network port is entered under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use username: and password: to enter the data needed to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The load.fm card board supports the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and thus update the profile: this setting allows it & Amarok; to transmit the names of the pieces played to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Retrieve similar interpreters: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list with similar interpreters to the played piece. you can view the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information see the summary of the functions and gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and no other KDE packages. so you have to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a little guide on how to compile kdelibs minimally.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions, such as the OSD, assume that your window manager lists the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by looking at ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this bug to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the times this is because taglib crashes from this file when reading meta information. please report this bug to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of the libraries used by & Amarok are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib has been compiled with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatic switch off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail will automatically open in case of a crash). if it is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-information, but do not label it as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "File $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = $mp3 &gt; get _ v2tags; print "Error in writing the tags from $ARGV [0]\" unless $mp3 &gt; set _ v2tags ($v2tags, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script requires the Perl module MP3:: mplib. it can be reinstalled with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e'install MP3:: Mplib '</seg>
<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (Random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten. you can sometimes click on a symbol in the Control Center under Appearance icons. note that in some cases, you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting displays its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: catup error: catacapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setpixel ERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok will use the correct Qt library. you can see this with ldd 'which amarkapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version, or / etc / ld.so.conf to customize the correct version of Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most installation problems are most easily resolved by the help of an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and IRC at irc.freenode.net in channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to search for help. please enter only one error if you are interested in fixing a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only an empty playlist appears. how do pieces of music get in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitive, the start -subwindow has been converted to the Statistics window. you will find it under Tools statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars represent the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select Show column. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece. you can also use the Windows + [1-5] short commands. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard. or right-click on your selection and then select Remove From Playlist from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist to the playlist and drop it there, just as you would do with other files. it's as simple as that: -)</seg>

<seg id="1270">It can! maybe you use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, with which no MP3 decoders are supplied (for patent reasons). the solution: Alt-F2, gg: RedHat MP3 kde, Enter key</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio simultaneously. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixers (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (Software-Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you might need to specify a different sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can't simply send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only want to listen to a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer will read the file, decode it and send the PCM data to ALSA. exactly like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server with highest priority (real-time priorization) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this bug report. enlarging the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts Driver but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts Driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been heavily optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in Control Center and Sound & Multimedia, Sound System.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes and Amarok; from. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After you have installed GStreamer, you will need to register all components. follow the follow-up register to register all of the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask in the IRC Channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (exit Amarok earlier!): - Download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then run all ffmpeg files once as system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all ffmpeg files in the module folder of GStreamer (you will find the module folder with you-config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1334">This chapter will explain how to use all the features of & Amarok, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; Control Center. at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the currently running track or current stream. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time of the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, including the running text display. you can change by using the available analyzer by clicking the mouse with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also under the scroll function. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used for setting Equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play-position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous play.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click on the EQ button in the Player window. once you mark the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist by & Amarok; is the most developed playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of features, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation pane. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">Context Browser shows different information about the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context-browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and artist. these three subwindows will be discussed later in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you've already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the subwindow has been dropped off. the information displayed there are now divided into other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be collected in the Statistics window (Tools statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title there is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover image of the album and a MusicBrainz icon next to it. click on this icon to look up the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You will find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz symbol. you can see how often and when the piece has been played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png formats are supported. the context browser will also show cover images which are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended Pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on any of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "under the" "" "Recommended" "" "pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter. this section displays the five most valued pieces of the current interpreter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">To set which information should be displayed in the music subwindow, right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work up and you will see the album's content.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the Text subwindow, the downloaded text is displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages with the help of scripts written by yourself. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the song text. the modified version is then saved in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required for this.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are arranged by artist and below will be another distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Different Interprets.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group Artist / Year - Album - Sort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year for an album is unknown, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by one another. the artist is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will be shown first by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the collection settings. note: & Amarok; will automatically rerecord your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own lots of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">There is a search filter directly below the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes about using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">There is a selection box under the search filter, which allows you to filter out the recently added pieces to your collection. you can also select from the last 24 hours to one year. of course you can also select your entire collection, which means that the filter will be switched off practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection Browser you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will empower the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to Playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will get the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Commit to media player - Add the pieces in the queue to transfer to the media player. see the section about the Media Player Browser for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this artist / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces will be sent to K3b and burned either as data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Displays the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files to the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation and it will appear under Different Interprets.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Record selection marking - Changes a compilation of selected album back to a normal album. after that the album will no longer be shown under Different Interprets but again under the respective artist.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser easily handles the use of many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection, which have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Add Smart Playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for connecting & Amarok; for example, using your portable media player (such as iPod). for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer songs to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Artist. when you are done, click Apply. thus, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. when the transfer is complete, quit & Amarok; and release the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files that do not meet your search criteria are hidden in the file list.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. for example, when you enter tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz you can listen to music in the musik.tar.gz file. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping the key. in this case, holding down the Shift key may be helpful: this will automatically insert invalid files at the end of the list, and not in the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop. once you enter the letters, only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter delimited search terms by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one or two three, the search will find all the entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter the search term OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. for example: one OR two OR three. in this example all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then close the search term with griffon feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the keyword: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you wish. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. the entries will then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar is a unique, larger analyzer. the refresh rate can be set with one click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu such as that which you can see in the player window via the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example playback controls and volume controls. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval is displayed, a slider for the playing position and the playing time of the current piece. the status for random mode and retrieval can be easily changed by double clicking in the respective display area with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window, or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist. this menu allows you to access & Amarok settings.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry will open the Visual plug-in window. there you can select the Visualizations of & Amarok; select.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can launch them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to display in the cover management. select:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move into & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue a number appears next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">When you want to add a piece to the queue, select the item in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already pre-specified (details on the setup of these follow later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Adds pieces based on load .fm recommendations (formerly: audio crobbler). this mode requires that some pieces already exist in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile to use this dynamic playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the playlist you want, drag them to the playlist window, or right-click on them and then select Load. this way, your current playlist will be replaced with the new one. so you should save the old playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes of Random Mix and Playlists mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly. the playlists received start with an empty playlist and you will need to add at least one piece yourself from your collection. the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece exchange, so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, turn on the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as starting point. the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry.</seg>

<seg id="1420">If this setting is not active, your playlist will continue to grow, the setting for coming pieces will be skipped and you will not hear a piece twice in that playlist. however, if the setting is active, the pieces already played will be removed while respecting the setting.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist. this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece. if you set more than 1 here, the playlist will continue to grow because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The settings on the right side are already described in the previous section. on the left side of the dialog, you can select from existing playlists and smart playlists. if you tick several playlists, & Amarok will add random pieces from each of the playlists you have selected.</seg>

<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the table of contents is enabled, its content is displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The table of contents allows selecting and dragging files to the project view. the table of contents is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, if a drive with an appropriate CD / DVD is selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog for changing the key assignments for & k3b. after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can customize the key assignment.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; Setup Wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are needed, so you have to enter the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings from & k3b; here you can set up general application settings. almost all functions of & k3b; should work right away. this dialog is designed for customizing and fine-tuning the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; -applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task is crucial, which of the contributor programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; started. then type something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions which have all & kde; program in common, support & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b provides functions like copyCD, formatted DVD, and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoCDProject () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void copyDvd () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burndvdImage (KURurl)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using the # dcop k3b K3b interface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project using K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used for data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, QString Transparency) void addUrl (QString url, QString Transparency) void addUrl (QString path, QString Transparent) void set-VolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folders:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3b interface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT appurl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audio creator; is an audio CD; -readout for & kde; with it can easily be audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audio creator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; -data in WAV files on hard disk) and supported by many encoders that encode these WAV files (these encoders packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if they are installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per caption) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, & audio creator; cdparanoia is used. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, it has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile it yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodimer gives a small introduction about encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & audio creator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device to circumvent protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling of reading a & CD is afterwards explained on the hard disk. this (hopefully) leads to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble over at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>

<seg id="1510">Opens the Setup dialog to configure the types of notifications (such as logs, pplets) for program events (such as reading & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main dialog of & audio creator; with different card cards (such as encoder, to set the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression rates, and helps you choose the correct encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. in addition to FLAC, there are also others like 'shorten' or 'monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the drawbacks are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression, depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences become less important as both encoders produce excellent audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, but lame is supplied free of charge with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but slightly lower quality compared to OGG for lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a song. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all tracks of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car osteroozers. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overstated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality regardless of the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched through the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / use with & cd creator; and the encoder program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; Title to the keyword (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt must be added by lame and the title Parameters of & Audio Creator; the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audio creator; parameters that can be needed (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that you can download / enter information, so that all others can download this information instead of yourself into the computer. it is to note that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of translation) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information released publicly on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & Audio Creator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb may be used with another (fake) address as the one in the system. in this way of configuration, it appears that the email address is not used when calling the data from the server (This can only be the programmers who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & when using freedb, the geographically closest mirroring server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from & CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs; see also note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not been done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the related Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. more information about encoder is in the chapter Welcher Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; konsole).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reading rights on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not be possible!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that will make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and our first & CD; read out. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 samples (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You must have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can, for example, be found using a search engine since it is considered as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permissions on it (eg by trying to copy something inside with the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & audio creator; something that is thought to be done only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read out a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them every time you read a & CD; once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The box map General Settings. there is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only In case of incomplete information, so that you will be informed if there is a lack of information on creating keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The box CD; -settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet during reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry is found, immediately starts reading the & CD; if you are unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries, they can be changed easily. the directory and file name will be changed with Konqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before. however, this is over 620 MB big, consider this twice whether this is worth it. in order to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first one.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server in your area. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, but as many firewalls the protocol 8880 is standard, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to send a CD; data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously discharged pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, so simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: check for the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be straightened to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good stereo hi-fi systems. the resulting bit rate is approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the resulting compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quad core or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just have the basic set up of & audio creator; finished. this configuration is used as the default for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will create and set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is set up because we are comfortable and the & CD; the process of the freedb must be retrieved.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots view a bit different from the data used for a & CD; therefore, you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually, instead of fetching them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD; this example can be found. it's a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, the & CD must now be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look for the Help section in the section Questions and Answers or go back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD has been successfully picked up by the freedb, all tracks are already filled in and the artist's name and album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; a window appears, and you can select the database entry, which in your opinion best fits your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; -settings in the Settings dialog), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but retrieve the data from the Internet, you will need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Actual Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the 'Actual Title' field, unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all compositions of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successfully retrieving the data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & audio creator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the created files anytime with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously does not match the style of the readout CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' go back to the main window. just click on the row with the second one.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. specify the title of the piece in any case and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the row switches the selection of the piece one or off. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you click on the Select button to read the selection process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">On tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for controlling the jobs. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You can see this error message when you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new record: assignment 4 is the encoding of part 1 into the format MP3. thus, read out and code parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. for low-performance machines, the result is unclear. the used computer with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the top left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & audio creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you will need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is directed to people who compile from source files, and not for users who use a precompiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that invokes many different programs has many variants of settings. best read the step by step, for example, to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, still to read? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any clue as it goes on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start up), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it all about? if you read this, you probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is considered as the first version for a manual on & audio creator; may it do. at least after contacting the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you have managed to get the source file from & kde; SVN, then you don't need these informations, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player from & kde; in addition to others, with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of lyrics, he also has some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound Project driver needed for CIS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can drag in & kde; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -Window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the used procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. when you stop & kde; when playing a song, kmid starts again with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -Window to the & kmid; -Window. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the Play item from the menu item, or press Space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece starts automatically as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (for several pieces they are added to a collection and then played one after the other).</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and thus change the playing speed. to get back the original tempo, double click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a play is played, a pressure on the space bar acts as a print on the pause button or the selection of the menu entry pause in the menu item, so interrupts playback. pressing the space bar while no play is played starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use texture events, others use lyrics event and other both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined which a song is used so that you don't have to manually adjust the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select the entries for text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that summarize you. these will be played back to you. in this section you will find how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the menu collection under the item Organize.... Click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired ones in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you exit the application, this collection is not stored. remember this when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it will again display the file dialog by which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic adding to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the pieces that are still open.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the row from the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs, or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select Next Song, next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song back, select the button Forecasts, select Preview item from the menu item or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but this does not matter, since it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and lets you always sound a trumpet, if originally a piano should be played.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe and GUS cards, FM instruments and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once except the Keymap section which may appear as often as desired. however, a precondition for this is that each occurrence has a different text id (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Default PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Keymap name... END Define Keymap" Another Keymap... "END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see Define is used to indicate that a section will begin (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so that I can in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section shows how General MIDI patches can be applied to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun. to do so, use the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it will take patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the word drum patch of the patch, in which each note represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, Maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used mainly to map sounds on the percussions channel. take a look at the supplied keybitmaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will be used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so, if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file no decimal commas are available).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard which receives a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to one octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; try it around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the menu under Settings, item MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which tones are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button does not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the View menu under the Channel View menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">So, for example, if you find that a song is too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 Kb, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Accept, therefore supports & kmid; drag and drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Always enable setting Automatic Add to Collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; Desktop a & konqueror; -windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or bypassed (when I play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, just switch to the & konqueror; -windows and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection, turn off automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files Amid, B.C and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the Automatic Add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play Bmid and Cmid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, this encourages me to continue to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I don't have much time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an enlargement of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will be listed among friends of & kmid; however, before sending a MIDI file, you should get in touch with me as I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; written entirely in my spare time and didn't get money from anyone for it. I would like to emphasize that I'm just programming it because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lu Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Thorsten Wesselder, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error correction or just a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid can also be found on his homepage, which is located at http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to pages with additional karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that of course you cannot hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If you encounter problems, contact one of the mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category of continuous playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level. if you click an item, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback will begin with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and continuous playlists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the various files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. to do this simply click on a name of a category, select from the menu View and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you must select the same with the playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by modifying the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during start and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can simply be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & SMB; note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would interfere with the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog from & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of SMB. here is the output of mplayer shown.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the Configuration dialog from & KMPlayer; everything needs to be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example like a 'flash' played with the swfcodec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; even the special embed field can be added to the playlist XML in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be provided as a service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave-flash in the Setup dialog file Assets of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. the started process means pop player. if there are no errors, the Backend output inside & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To ensure that a given backend is always taken for a certain mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this needs to be done by changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play cards from TV, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be chewed, the device to use and the TV channels have to be configured. to do so, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring VDR (video data recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the Settings is under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port to use. there, ports should be detected by which one is selected. the encoding must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name has probably contained a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support for SMB can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. therefore, for the XFree86 server, the following must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of creating this documentation, these are dvdnopen, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanners, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrones.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any hints how I can quieter my CDROM drive when I play from it (not by the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom is root after mounting the device. it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / cdrom is pointing to the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts slowly, why does my CPU have to be checked for performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right language: lay-TECH. while the original & tex is difficult to use, a layman (lay) & latex; macros can also be used. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it derives from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here is given only a good overview on & latex, it is not the ultimate book about it. to be properly proficient, good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Same as other markup languages includes & latex; an introduction that defines the general characteristics such as paper format, page numbering and text size as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ documentclass, the body begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick entry assistant from & Kile; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) provides some options for the creation of the document. you can also make some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this describes the type of document to be created: article (article), book [curriculum], report [scrartcl], report [scrartcl], book (DIN) [scrdprt], book (DIN), projector [beamer], slides [Prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is used to set the character encoding. it should use the character encoding of the system. modern systems increasingly use the UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for the correct processing of the & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex and latex. for the integration, they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), letter (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (in compliance with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it's just a short description of the functions and further information on this is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; also offers - as well as other source editors - highlighting the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile, it is very likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed. however, you have noticed it due to the modest appearance of the output file. however, you will save time and effort by highlighting.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & Kile; automatically creates an empty line (for the input of the text) and the associated line for the command of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the Settings box; set... LaTeX commands can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and sub-screen the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex files, the search search can be very helpful. once a DVI; file [more independent file] is created, skip & Kile; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI; -Viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; -Source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the available output types by & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back button, the elements of the DVI; file are selected with the editor and once it has been clicked on an element in the DVI; file is the exact opposite of it. as soon as it has been clicked on a section in the & latex; source code is clicked to the corresponding point in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set via project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">"" "quick installation: the" "" "& latex" "" "source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there is no error in the source code)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1768">"" "video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is called" "" "insider" "" "in this mode, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the quick mounting." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the quick classification of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available and latex commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The further selection field is for inserting items such as keywords, footnotes or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, a picture or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Cover: used for reference to a specified term (choose from a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">Using Quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. for & bibtex; this only works if the file is related to a project. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ tley is used for determining the font size. it can be set the font s for the main text, the jointies, etc. there are the following font sizes available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, there are two choices available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parenthesis after the command\\ 'documentclass lists the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the source code above has been entered, the & latex has to be compiled; the easiest way to do this is the use of the volume building or the button of button construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; it automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document fails, it should be searched for errors during the logging process. if it is used for quick installation, the eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A environment (environment) is a text that is handled differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report containing a text size 12 and a few columns should have a different type of text. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment}, then the change of the font can be set within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are reserved only within the environment (environment) up to\\ end {environment}). there are no restrictions (number) for change within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. it can, for example, be added to certain fonts, bold print, passive pressure, submissions, etc. these commands end either with the command\\ or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italics and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be italic represented with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code with the & latex has been displayed, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a little text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be made. at least one quote, a few places in the bold and italics pressure and a poem are to be used to see the differences in these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor-View or Ctrl E can be returned back to the editor (internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I nage). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .di output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file the same steps are necessary as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - you can print the document by file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar allows converting the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & nbsp; source code, the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binaries. to do this, just setup Modern under Settings Kile... Tools to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the advance search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and then be clicked on forward search. the jump to the corresponding point in DVI; the viewer takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document of & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this & Kile; in & eyepiece; set as text editor (setting up the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quick-build / DVI; viewers do not open, a fault can be found. if there is an error, this will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file explores the source of errors in the source code. in the editor, the buttons for LaTeX errors and other LaTeX errors can be used between the errors. the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears. in order to view the faulty line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & Kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document may either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. further information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Independent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file needs to be created. & Kile; can create a new template using the creation of an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings Kile... Settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering into document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ 'documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps have to be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex files; an easy way to create a template will be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below should be executed.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (among them also & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and to experience its options, the manual should be used for Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter Works with the editor of & kate; start.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; -command reference, which can be called via the MenÃ ¼ Help LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex, as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with a pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex -word. this means that in this way, when you click on\\ par of\\ par\ bigad.skip is only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source codes and emphasize them. for example, the basic and latex commands differ from normal text and mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jump tokens. this is a distinct type of bookmark within the text. the menu Edit Springphones or the corresponding keyboard shortcut the jump to the next or final springtime stamp. this stamp is also highlighted, so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; although & kate; already outstanding features have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; -Source text added, and therefore support & Kile; special commands for selection. under Edit Selection the following commands are included in the selection of text:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Contains a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning is thus not meant as a text with single rows (as in other text editors). this extended meaning is thus associated with tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. this is the only curpointing cause in & Kile; this means that the sections are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">This selection also has an extended meaning since this command also has an extended meaning, since this command is also available with latex and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, natural this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & kate; provides the keyboard shortcut Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. under Edit removal the following commands are included in the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is contained in the description to edit Select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in and latex; therefore & Kile; for additional commands in the editing environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command is used to jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command is used to jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is).</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front of or inside the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environmental commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command completes the last opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; -groups specified by {...} groups. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from working environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is used to jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is).</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command is used to jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the closed clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curly clip of a & tex; -group #, it will jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering multiple braided group braces quickly the overview can be lost. this command is the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple instructions are used as a bed for use. for the purpose-bearing implementation is used in & Kile; the sign "for two simple quotes." & Kile; knows this case and for two closing statements for latex.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of double quotes can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There can also be custom settings (e.g., german or french), and thus German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When using Shift; Enter key & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), for & Kile; not only a line break, but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table -environment, complete & Kile; the current line with\\\\ with a close line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be set under Settings Kile; set up... LaTeX added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby all Et signs (amp;) among each other. & Kile; tries to make this possible. while using Shift; Alt; amp; looks & Kile; according to the next tab in the next line. although this tab is not the associated table, add & Kile; some space for the columns position of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already provides a good source code completion, it has been added to & Kile; in order to implement special commands (mostly for latex;), three different modes are built. all of these modes can be set up for different modes of working under Settings... Complete set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the reset button is pressed, the last character of the input is removed and, as a result, the complete list is set up. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command. alternatively from & Kile; also jump stamps be inserted, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by working on the Ankle mark NÃ ¤rst jump brand and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; setting up... Kile; adjustments can be made to these lists. there can be various lists of sounds for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as books of general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the completion of environments. there must always be entered a few letters with\\ begin and the call of the default mode will result in a large list of ambient commits. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the completion-mode over the MenÃ ¼ editing area or the key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears\\ begin {. afterwards, the environment completion can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Cle; realizing that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be included.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; setting up... Kile; defaults can be made to these lists. this mode uses the List of Discounts mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; support user-defined lists of abbreviations that are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Cle can be set up. for example, the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the character L is entered and the word defaults to completion or the Ctrl + Alt space bar is introduced, the character L is replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large weavers are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been established that many weavers are written in a document more than once. thus offers & Kile; the comprehension for all already written weavers.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings box... Cle can be completely shut down. here you can also set the threshold value for the ad to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / the local home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation (Abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Prints dialog box designs the design of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of graphic formats, the sections should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be re-arranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted to ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to be able to examine the result of the work, first the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are grouped in groups in the building compilation, creating conversion and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer like & eyepiece; or the other conversion can be used the keyboard shortcut Alt; 2. afterwards the DVI; file can be viewed in a standard-like viewer by means of old; 4 the DVI; file converted to a PS file and be viewed by old; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick Building command, a viewer is normally called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will open every time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be asked about the Project New Project.... here you will find the following information for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When you fill the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function from & Kile; allows the execution of the ECMAScript code. the scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet developed and can be changed in other versions of & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & Kile; a system-wide object (= Kile) has the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite sophisticated system in which basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & Kile; provides a lot of different help to support users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; delivered with a lot of documents, including a documentation for the packages included and a further & latex reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">This is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a complete user manual for the & latex; commands included and is therefore ideal for searching for a certain formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into & Kile; divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / textrad; delivered, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help offers & tetex; / textrad; the small application texdoctk, which contains a database with all to & Kile; delivered documents and here for a graphical surface.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or banners. from & Kile; then only the results are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& Kile; is a quelloffener and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; -Source editor which can be performed on all systems with installed & kde; -working space environment. & Kile; is also part of the Fink project, whereby & Kile; also on & Mac; can be executed with OS-X installed.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus; laze, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. this makes the plugin system very powerful. you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not wait until someone builds up the desired in & Quantaplus; the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; -elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start with the Edit Plugins section. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all of the included plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; -element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location used & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship with each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured using Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as both team leaders and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select himself from the list of team members who he is. this happens by searching the team member out of the list and pressing the button Setze. the currently selected member (their identity) appears fat after which you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and their own identity are important in terms of messages and annotations. see for further information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of your team, there is a further advantage by capturing members of the team: it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be drawing up the opening and closing of the project, so that later you can see how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that takes a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the site Event configuration of the Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>

<seg id="1943">It can be either the note entry chosen from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment field followed by Comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, role in the project has the following possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roll names are independent of upper or lower case, but whitespace around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by setting up Quanta. this dialog will cover some pages that will be treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags, including auto-completion, can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Uppercase / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal Gross / lowercase means the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Uppercase / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal Gross / lowercase means that the attributes are inserted as described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if checked, tags for which the closing tag is optional will be inserted immediately after & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Automatically close any optional tags: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and finish date: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the appropriate encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mime types for detecting different types of files. using the Standard button, the defaults can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise as with file opening of opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting here is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting here is emitted from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; regularly creates backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash the document can be restored from this backup at the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor's area or in a separate view (or the documentation in a tab), making it possible to look at the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset window settings to default at the next launch is useful if the user interface has been messed up by changing MDI modes and andocken / interfacing views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message section is used to control the display of warnings by enabling non-polling of warnings.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to modify the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL and source text view in shared mode. see the different modes.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the mapping of the parser nodes in the document, can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structure Tree Configuration section, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change to the structure tree should be opened automatically. empty nodes are empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The range for setting abbreviations (a type of templates) that are unfolded when editing to a larger text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the default shortcut is something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are KPart applications from third side, which can be reused by any KPart-enabled application, most known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located in a standard as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at the start, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load a component in the "read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only read-in parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. select the saving of the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead of this a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger Plugin Selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to debug demands. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so normally you don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session Start the session. closes the connection to the Debugger or finishes listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to send a debug request. this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to the monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. happens before a debugging requirement is given, the execution begins once a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include files.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instruct the Debugger to move over the directive and go to the next as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered that is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable list view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog can enter a variable or set a new value to a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; used to provide support for marker and script languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes out & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages respectively & CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and the toolbar; and TagXML files include handy, symbol-oriented bars of image buttons (above the editing pane), adding text and instructions faster to a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be manually created (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbar buttons allow quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag Archives are nothing but folders. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is described in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an tagXML document. it can only happen once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but an element type of itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when used, attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Applied only to the type method. specify the name of the class where this method belongs. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common-attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to each other day. (only Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Set a text in the dialog. this text is defined by & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it sets the name and type of attribute. additionally, there are further tags describing how this attribute should be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Indicates the source code used for filling for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag which groups the elements of a list together. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. for each tag; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag that can be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration starts: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing, but pay attention & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; text &gt; will not cause a break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is up in & quantaplus; to launch the window and select TagXML. another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This feature is currently not available yet. currently, the check is carried out only when the TagXML files are loaded in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">This file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element of the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a functioning Family 2 tag XML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this tagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returnkey = "void" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">Open descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD edit DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc can be processed; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created for a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can set actions with Settings... to be created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the User Defined button a keyboard shortcut can be assigned; with K1 the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the defined settings and when the action is executed, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action you can start external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that will change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even the springstart dialog or the various see in... actions for (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This is a global script folder: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in your path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used for controlling & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods, a script can be input by & quantaplus; in the input field you can specify what is to be sent to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input the output of the executed application can be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages written to the default output. it can be specified what should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value in the selection box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start the edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete it all and, if the day has attributes, and you plan to use their use, enable "Edit Day" dialog when available, so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "Igitt! is this an ugly symbol? who should remember the action in connection with this symbol?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better we will use & kiconedit; use. select from & KMenu;, Graphics more programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixel by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Edit Size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With a view that the day start is called, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is mostly seen as los, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; start; -Tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it has to be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be split into several groups for a better overview. open the toolbar, set dialog on Settings toolbar. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the Trenner (top left corner) for my toolbar. after selecting the element which is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to preview a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by absorbing all the symbols to make sure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup in the correct folder. after New XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc, so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to find an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you have to create the docrc file. we will leave the first part to you, the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for this documentation for example & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = functions1 = functions1 = functions1 = functions1 = functions1 = functions1 = tag2.html tag3 = functions.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element top item = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and conveniently located at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the section of the docrc file which is used for creating context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connector lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of text-separated contextual elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your docrc file simply to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this is good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; -Community. you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or anyone else. in different places there is an Email menu item, such as DTD DTD (DTEP) send with email, send tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scripte tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and only made available when our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to make a financial contribution, we recommend to sign the resources for which it requires a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for your passphrase for your private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource, you have to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and by clicking OK the Upload will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD (DTEP) menus, uploading the toolbar's toolbar, and can be started from the files and folders context menu in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed properly, a notification appears with the indication of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in tag XML format. there's the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Converting menu of DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD declaration to use. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directories name: the newly created & DTEP; written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that is in! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand them and to draw full benefits from & quantaplus, you must first familiarize yourself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to explain these concepts to them without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. from toolbars to actions, everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to backup different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory so that only this user can use them personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the building mansions, the tabs with information and toolbars. please check in and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all tab, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor area leads to another context menu regarding the edited document content, such as the basic processing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the word under the mouse-cursor, or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbar buttons. currently & Quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbar buttons is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert a simple tag, such as & lt; if they want to insert into their document, then click on the icon representing the tag. now you can insert the data for that just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill out different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and roam them. in the presentation with cartons, for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation building views are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows administrators to manage files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media can be done with the contextual menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; All possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; working range. global templates are always available, local templates only for the relevant user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the spin-off in Global, Local and Project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can change attributes and namespaces with it. the application system focused on the content allows changing all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the option to define custom commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; send the tool bar as compressed Tar archive over & kmail;. if you get a tool bar in an email, you can secure it in & quantaplus; like any other save and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; -files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of their bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While attempting to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; a standalone, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him the most powerful web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & Quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be noted that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why developing what already someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; -scaffolding is not only possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details, help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest entry is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check the section on templates. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder, only one error will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts the special characters to & HTML for pasting from the clipboard where they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; write which is the correct way to insert special characters and whitespace into & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Turn on or off block selections. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages are out!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and pre-defined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of the script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Pressing and switching the problem report at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem report is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the column column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Pretty or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear grouped in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Displays a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project managed. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a Project Toolbar. these are stored in project you / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog box to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions need to be set by settings actions... saved. tool bars are stored on tool tracks toolbar, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you will be asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the tool bar is available in the next publication). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbar buttons to the main server, where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else has done and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities of the & DTEP are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission is not present in the global KDE folder, the store will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu Standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current date settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">This only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar is denied if this day is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the Plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items mentioned above. click on them. if you click on an activated plugin, it will be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the current file.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the line end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes need time or create unnice graphics. recommended is the card card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on / off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">Changes in this dialog will affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should best be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, after completing the project name, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.gexample) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field blank, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on the setup of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars as standard. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to go differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clip from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new Project Assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded from the Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the Profiles window or Shift + F7 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders) that will be ignored for project related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the desired debugger. currently only gubed is supported. more information about gubed can be found in. the debugger plug-in can be set using the Options button. debugging is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profile tab, Upload Profiles (see in) can be set as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited, or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the Event configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, modify or delete these actions. event actions are executed when a pre-defined event occurs, such as the backing up of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the Project tab Open from the toolbar. the dialog Open Project will be displayed and allows you to select a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries opening and opening are missing... in the context menu available with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only a profile is available, the button is blended to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten at the end of the program. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high loading profiles can be created to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be shown:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The upload protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should be able to choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed, unless the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it at your discretion. the password is saved on the disk, so it is not easy to read, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. it can give a lot of views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted from the Project Toolbar menu or the Project toolbar, accessible from the Settings toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which you can do the most. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to your own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, tool bars in & quantaplus are best stackable via the menu toolbar. use and adding differ. adding tool bars is handled down in the section Add of Toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either through context menu (right-clicking on the toolbar), in which other actions such as tool bar can be removed, toolbar can be renamed or toolbars can be executed, which can be indicated which actions on this or other toolbar should be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up toolbar settings in the Settings menu... and set Settings...</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snips and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you make for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; delivered templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binaries. binary templates are usually inserted in documents using shortcuts (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specialized documents are created in corresponding subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organizes the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents again and again. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl based.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure as desired (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template Save as a local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As Template Save option as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as pulling and dropping or pasting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or project files, select a site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, the project folder will be backed up, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very purposeful approach. you can pretend to headers and footers or dynamically create with & PHP; design, insert or link them to them. in addition, some things can be kept very deep in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The Template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files laid in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / templates / templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types previously described; files, text or templates.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the Template Overview. if a root folder is set up, it would disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text block. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or annotated text templates for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows for copying contents templates to a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you can use context menu (show right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & Source editor that can be reached through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second splits the editor window into two parts: the source editor and VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to the source editor if necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -editor on a document that & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the Vohanddon of & PHP; source text. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; edit & PHP; to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one except that at the same time the changes both in the source editor and VPL; editor is visible and the cursor is in sync with the source editor and the VPL; editor is already active, the touch of a button will move the active cursor from one window to the other, keeping the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source editor can be set via settings Quanta. after choosing VPL; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select the document properties. thus editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this can be changed:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. Meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Using the cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving the arrows. in rare circumstances the cursor behaves strangely. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the button or removal key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source editor. it is to be noted that inserting tags from previously existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other surrounding armature day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar functions such as the Tables Assistant or the Listen Anywhere are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists tool bar must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this feature turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently of each other on one piece of code and make changes. the merge editor among the differences windows allows for resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; for folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and resists the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you need to frequently check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is identical and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, you can make typing work easier by only writing the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folder 2-diff3 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder Folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will remember your selection and display it again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">By the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, however, for B and C a folder then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not strictly necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setting button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. in the opening dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use Drag and Drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would first need to create two corresponding files, load them into & kdiff3; load and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text to another program as cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The Info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the complete name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed using the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized one can see the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in settings). the color scheme is especially useful when comparing three files. that's good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the pre-processor and in few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line on broken lines is scored points.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line labeled Output:, the filename and [Change] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the buttons to next resolved / unresolved conflicts to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, any difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be resolved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown. (this will also cause a jump of position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes no more row is left in the group through the automatic merging or by manual editing; then in these lines the text & lt; no line is displayed in the queue; this is only a wildcard for the case that you change your mind and maybe re-insert another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy this text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources to ignore the numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, up, down, side down, side down, start, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">You can also use the other buttons to edit in the display window. with the insert button you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">Click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns to synchronize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the Merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven navigation buttons with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-above) or to the next / previous non-resolved conflict. note that & kdiff3; all non-automatically solved conflicts remain regarded as conflict even after manual conflict. therefore, conflicts between dissolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Paste). if this is enabled, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and manual copying is omitted. be careful with this option because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems do not use a carriage return + line feed character\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line end of the source files, so you should not use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved when you exit and restored at the next start. (set up menu settings - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the chosen font does not support this representation nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be scanned. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically adjusts an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of space characters is inserted when the Tabulator button is pressed. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the reset of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each option is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line end type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first, find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character\ 'r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others save only a line feed '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the car return sign, but then, files with different sizes in page-on-side comparison might look identical, however like a white sign. while merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search intensively for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow on very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic sprint mode, this setting determines how long the result will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you need this only from time to time, then use better the Function A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic selection also applies conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore figures or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the section on how to scan folders and execute a merge operation. see documentation on directory comparison and merge tracking for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and an older version already exists, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need to exit and reboot so that the change will be active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">In the selection fields for the encoding a short note appears, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">When editing a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processor commands, they may not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processor commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress the emphasis of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the Options are ignoring numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color coded oversee column. but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply blend the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide instantly to merge the files. merge the current file in the merge menu also works if you compare only two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut off annoying parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processor command is also specified (see above), the output of the command is used only for line query. you can write your own pre-processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required and most users do not want to program it himself. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line queries to convert the input to capital letters: SED's /\\ (\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergular expression that matches any string. the\\ U returns the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert created strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). so, a pre-processing command for line abortion is required. *\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line adjustments. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at a time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can use something else like perl -p -e 's / regexp / replace / SCHALTER' However, perl needs some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for display and merging. further operations only alter the data that the newline algorythmus can see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders in recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to be merged; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and displays the simulated changes without really performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as the base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, a small message window informs you about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folders, only the files that have been compared until then are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scan of the folders is completed, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually shown together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - or by double-clicking on the object. the directory menu contains two functions Unfolding All sub-directories and flaps all subdirectories with which you can open / unfold all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the comparison window will be started and a comparison window will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the columns A / B / C uses the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identically if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. for folders, the age is irrelevant for his color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. when A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. when A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option synchronize dirs. then select & kdiff3; select the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B do exist, but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees only B as visible filename for the output file; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsure) is enabled, then & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different but the same date appears, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not eliminated, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, a file will be processed after the other. it Status column shows completed if the merge was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis in the setup dialog, KDE will display further columns. these contain the number of unresolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all merging actions (also in all subfolders), you can launch the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the Three-Folder Merge mode, C is used as the destination, while the two-folder merging B is chosen as the destination and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries should be in the target folder, also displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that may skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select / start directory merge / continue in the directory -menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to merge only the current entry, select Run action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid interaction actions, a message appears that indicates the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options passing, simulating and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select another directory merge / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, then an appropriate dialog will appear. then & kdiff3; continue working with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; stakes on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), let & kdiff3; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, these entries (in the current session) will not work together again. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries are merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set menu Setting - &gt; KDiff3...) has now a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would be ignored by CVS. many autoptically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be set with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hiding-attribute. in other filesystems, a preceding point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; does not check for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link to yourself would lead to an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that contain no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed benefit costs you a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change, there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal in size. this can be useful, for example, when the modification date is lost. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enable the synchronization mode if two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that after both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are saved in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, the copy of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is considered insecure because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too.) This option is disabled in default.)</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another one, the original version is renamed and gets the .orig. If an old backup file already exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal merge of individual files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">You can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can disable the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can disable the pop-up window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder collapse.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-reading</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, space = &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished as to whether a link to a file or folder shows. then always a file is assumed as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidence of Size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently considered a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In KDE Part display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally it takes & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a KPart, it takes & kdiff3; then takes & kdiff3; then removes & kdiff3; the name of the original files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program will start to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview KDE Part from the Preview context menu. note that this does not work if none of the original files exist. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; executed as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now called Kompare) already exist. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default, configure will install in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identically; however, if only a non-white sign is different, the line will be treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is aware of any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has been too large so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to process larger amounts of text another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text suddenly; no src is left; and the text cannot be cleared. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misleading the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE, please visit the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found at http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install the & kdiff3, on a system with & kde; use the following command in the basic folder of the & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir Specifies the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, see the README file for more details.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have problems with compiling. should you still encounter difficulties, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift) copies into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replace the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you need to re-read the folder with the refresh function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries that show differences. this also causes identical files to be copied not to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. note in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work surfaces, change their size, stop them or shift them. this works both inside a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; movement is possible both inside a desktop and other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only displays the two entries Pager... and Finish. however, if an application is clicked inside & KpStorage, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimise, Maximize, On Desktop and Finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected Virtual Desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is enabled, in & Kpager; the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is intersected together with name, the names will be provided with folder numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is enabled, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is enabled, the running programs are displayed as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to allow selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the windows with their default symbol and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main window can be specified: classically lets & Kpager; shown in a 2xN grid, as from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in horizontal and vertical lines in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying sideways on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move windows as symbols or with their contents.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and then set up switch-over switch... make the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like & kedit; or vi. if you don't have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer is on the same spot. it is meant to help people who suffer from the repeating Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click is causing pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer may be caused by a doctor if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool helps to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and triggers a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The intelligent shifting activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the mouse button is pressed. in this way, you can drag the mouse with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be plugged at the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes Move is enabled, the Turn field is activated (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the mouse button is waiting before the mouse button is pressed again, if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the click by mouse shift. if this function is enabled, a slower move will be saved to the right and back followed by a pause, one click with the right mouse button. this moves will be stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, if & kmousetool; the first time is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; go to Sound & Multimedia, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the General tab. there's a scroll bar sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at each start & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; this feature is currently only available at & kde; please consult the respective documentation for GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values that were set when you open the dialog. if you have already pressed the user button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the final pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, smart moving should be turned off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the smart shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should make a conscious mind in which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not constitute a link leads to unintentional reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick here is that you do not just clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to remove the mouse ball. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can scrape off the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or your fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just started shifting, this means that & kmousetool, which can no longer terminate the operation by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool, using another window manager and moving a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can perform a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input. thus, accidental moving of mouse & eg can cause unwanted reactions. safe zones for mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shifting, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely to highlight text, copy it to the clipboard and insert it again or perform any other action by which you might want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool; instead, select a mouse click at the one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will be played every time & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the move time starts with intelligent shifting. later, you can use the intelligent shifting even without the audible mouse click. but for that, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the XTest-extension for & X Window System must be installed. this should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and a speaker and is properly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer is short. this program was developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and who are causing pain to be affected by the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS works with any voice synthesizer, which can be started on the command line in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out-of-date. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizers to the supported languages. see also on the ktts webpage;, for information not contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The "speech-dispatcher" program uses an adaptable modular architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & ktts; for the use of another synthesizer, contact the development team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktts, you need a current development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or later), including the kdelibs package and the development files for the speech-dispatcher program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for the kgressin or downloaded the tarball currently created every night, you will be able to compile and install the program using the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktts; first use speech synthesizer to work properly with your speech synthesizer. to do so, use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of the speech-dispenser; the program ktmmsgr should be developed in such a way that the setting up of speech dispatcher is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual sets. the user can leave the set or paragraph style, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application passes text to & ktts, it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for output. for example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its sex is female, this is used, otherwise the best suitable speaker is chosen. if you want to learn more about how & ktts; select a speaker, you'll see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add or Add a Spokesperson on the Fill menu, and with it to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the box of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details on the modules, see.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival in PATH is included, you just have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text submitted to the festival. for voices that are known & ktts, this setting is automatically done. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controls and show this grey, the voice you choose does not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like multi-syn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so that the first set is synthesized faster (with larger memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or click Apply to click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window is displayed on the start of ktmgr. otherwise, only the symbol ktmgr is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and ktmgr does not work yet, it will appear in the system area as soon as KTTIP reads a text. this allows you to stop or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sets and the currently edited set.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series you can go forward or backward in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">By clicking on OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other card cards) are taken over and ktmgr is resized to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to view the program window again.</seg>

<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you must find out for yourself which device works with you. in doubt, select Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this map you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text assignment is interrupted by a higher priority message. & ktts; processes four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. after the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & mouth; is an example of an application that sends messages. if you just have a long text read on a web page, you can with & kutter; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">A text message is interrupted by a message, warning, or the output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output is included in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is played whenever a normal text message is interrupted. if both the sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are valid only for normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; Notify messages, launch ktmgr and click Notifications. the tab Notification will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to enable the reading of & kde; -Notifications. if this setting is not selected, the remaining settings are disabled and desktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">When this setting is selected, notifications when a sound is played are ignored by & ktts; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. when you click the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the standard voice, the festival is used in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or sound in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100, SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Encoding = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;!

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs divide text into single phrases. this allows & ktts to start reading, because only the first set has to be synthesized, because only the first set can be synthesized, or stop or stop, even if the voice synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the punctuation limit detection filter. at the first launch of & ktts; as a default, a set limiter filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add more propositional detection filters, but beginners will not be advised.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the easiest way, you will learn how to set up the language selection by selecting. turn on the speaker selection and enter text for reading. please check the speaker selection, change some properties and check how the choice of the speaker changes. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then start reading faster, because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can pause or interrupt your text orders on the map card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal punctuation detection filter is automatically set up when you start ktmgr for the first time. it can not be switched off, only removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Typeface Recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional phrases and insert a tab character (decimal code 8) at the propositional boundaries. note that the standard punctuation limit filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-filters are never used on & kde; -messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal punctuation detection filter from mistake, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can overwrite the subscriber settings for the application on the box menu. the card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top of the card speaker). in other words: no speaker characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker that has all the features of a set up speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; select this speaker. otherwise select & ktts; select the speaker that best matches the originally set characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker. if this property does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in getting the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is if you know that a certain application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all the features in the speaker segment, which is most likely to delete the following, click the Default button and then use the speaker, which is most likely to follow the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 stands for the last word order in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without order number, enter 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Ktmgr falls off immediately when it is started. I have compiled debugging support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x is closed. you probably need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not resolved, you may have installed a non compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">Audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application. if I hold a text order, freezes & ktts; one. on the & console; a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur with ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. please refer to the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org for possible solutions.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I loaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet. I have installed it and can use it in the festival, but ktmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocals. as a guide, you can add the other entries to you. if this is successful, please send a patch together with the & URL; at which you have found the voice to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. to make this work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable through the PATH environment variable. some synthesizers such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the voice card for speaker setup. depending on the selected voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The setting for the microphone speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) Remove the filter for converting from & HTML; according to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after SSML resizing filter, and set up the microphone speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read web pages with a female voice. I have set up a female festival spokesman, but & ktts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">With festival 1.95 beta, Sable GENDER does not seem to work. in order for the Festival to produce no errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER-tags to convert SSML to Saber. the same also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a separate string replacement filter and now I can go in & ktts; no more set-up or go back. on the box carrier orders will be shown, the job consists only from one set. what do I do wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You may not filter punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). instead, use a filter for the punctuation limit detection.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer, before using GStreamer in & ktts; the command prompt register. (HTTP: / / gstreamer .freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience conflicts with the audio output in connection with ALSA. if your system counts, you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktts; also freezes when you hold a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read aloud.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for general setting of the speech speed but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can install sox using the command apt-get install sox. the program is on most & Linux; -CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">When tarball (tarball with tar archive) is downloaded, login as normal user and unpack the tarball into an appropriate folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least only created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have run time dependency of non-free software.

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and multiple voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help is provided in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male UK) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you have to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the german voices are subject to restrictions on forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice assumes Festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still at an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter the voices of MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. choose a Cyrillic (8-Bit-) encoding as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">The festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic such as coi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; then Festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; it creates the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA is not a complete language dispensing system. & MBROLA; generates language from diphone files. you need additional software to create this diphone.

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; allowing management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu bar controlcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module will be displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot be installed. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured properly, so & knetworkconf; the device actually displays and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed for installing & Linux; with installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by matching the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Network Setting option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -index. when starting the Network Setting, this will automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and release status. selecting non-re-polls allows setting the definition permanently. when the network settings are started, then this selection is automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed grey, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. click the button System Preview mode at the lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available, divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the network interface:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface... to be edited in the Device dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Automatically selects the TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are executed with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The manual can be used to specify the TCP / IP configuration without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if initialization is not desired, this option should not be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. by ping in the & Console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or turned off as needed. power-on of an outdated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be turned on or off if required. disabling an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and deactivating the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host IP address in the local subnet which communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a complete domain request by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator is a simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be re-arranged by selecting an entry and execution or downgrading in the list with the buttons Hinds or Herunderneath in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group hosts to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator for name resolution select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will be displayed in the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names in particular describes hostname-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily on booting if there are no DNS servers available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list of names in particular contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some specific IPv6 addresses. this version of IP still under review will replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add... The Add New Alias dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known host and click the Add button. if the well-known machine has several alias names, press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry from a name by name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Defect Calculator will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be performed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Setting module are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & Console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The Homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt is installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; in addition, the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetwork.The following commands should do so.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter you will find important information about basic network technology, and in the second chapter all of the & knetworks.configuring configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found much dissemination. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in other networks, at the & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the point of contact that allows a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a separate small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks we usually use addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own machine).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 net address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to your own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part are the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if there is a different content than specified there in case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. a different stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which additionally offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective loading. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take if you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be mounted by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; retrains the tape and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognize & dat; do not recognise the pre-tensioner on the tape, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognises & dat; the pre-tensioner, searches for the appropriate index on your plate. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was mounted. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be browsed by opening the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; due to a change in the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been loosened and shows in the status bar a corresponding message. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape must be formatted before you can use it to store data. if your tape drive requires formatting a tape before using it, this must happen before you can format the tape. floppy tape drives normally require formatting the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the tape away. all data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically mounted and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are saved.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Rightclick the local file tree and select Save In the Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog box opens. in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog will appear Backup. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the index file based on the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files located in the same file system are backed up as the folder. folders located on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform incremental backup. to find out which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; and lt; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & dat; before the tape is embedded the command mt load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; lock the throw at the tape drive. possibly this option does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when solving & kdat, automatically eject the tape. do not use this option with floppy disks.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you have to communicate the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should contain only one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is machine name: seconds, whereby the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; -tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; Viewer for System Logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; attempts to provide advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for syslog server format and samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog provides functions for easy filtering and sorting of the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup tries & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - is not displayed, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not started with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or entered strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed, so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter. then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">Of course, you can also select another entry in this place. for example, in the Log File System Protocol, select the process column. for example, in the Log File System Protocol, select the Process column, and also enter the name of a process in the filterbar, so show you & ksystemlog; all log lines that were sent and / or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. log-lines of level Error are displayed with a more conspicuous color as minutes lines of the level critic. the colored representation of minutes lines can be disabled in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to show a specific process (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new log lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to view multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find further up-to-date information on the sources of & ksystemlog.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named in the following) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init quickly becomes the standard for controlling program start-up when running the system in & Linux; world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about this myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V Init without having to re-install and reformat it. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init has been removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole bunch of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service you want to start when you start the system or when you switch to another running level. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial that is started only once.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port at startup.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for the init program at different places and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runtime is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel is 3. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you can repair it by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server running level that only lets httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; run. in addition, I could also have a user -runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; using a mouse or any other pointing device is simple in order not to say trivial: just drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six runlevel to launch it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move the scripts between the level or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. the entry will be removed from its original Runtime (or its position). this does not happen only if they extract an entry from the field of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new run level, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sorter numbers of the entries, before you can try to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired runtime by inserting it (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the Input key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. Preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, it is restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard running leveles, and now the machine starts constantly anew. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runtime to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration of the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check that all configuration files are present that are needed by the system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as eg; Apache or httpd) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the running level so that it can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation applies to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you make changes, you must save it. either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two file cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group by double-clicking on the entry. it appears the user / group properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled wildcard restrictions (quota) for users will create a map file on which you can make individual settings. other card cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The Password Management card appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one native filesystem space restriction (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quota user / quota group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, the limitations of the space in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected with space limitation using the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card group informs groups about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group, which the user belongs, can be found in the Field Primular Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group's Dialogue features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO Boiler, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
