although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
at the age of 14 I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less journalist who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate who wanted to occupy the supreme court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US only strengthened .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very fan@@ ati@@ ful letter of love written about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never holds behind the mountain in his opinion , as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in multi@@ tudes .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the Party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that receives people from all over the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Wel@@ tan@@ schauung also did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Brand@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me a lot during my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nom@@ in@@ ised Republi@@ can presidential candidate , it offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception to the rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , the pres@@ idency sent a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the argument with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look those things , broke my heart almost .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ elec@@ tors as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those acting in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that those voters , most of whom know , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note of the O@@ B . ) : as much as &quot; white against all other ethnic groups , &quot; white and whi@@ plas@@ h word play , which means &quot; bl@@ unt trauma &quot; as the great Van Jones described , has killed exactly what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its President , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan man whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else would be possible anywhere else in the world .
but with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge part of the white America this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd was ro@@ aring .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices got lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that &apos;s not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son was pleased sent him a message .
this is Tr@@ um@@ ps Land now , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what did the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town C@@ ate@@ ura have in common ?
that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre@@ ol@@ umb@@ ine ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the poverty that surrounds them .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gang violence .
but this changed after a casual meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the whi@@ stle you learn day for day trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga to play .
music from Wa@@ ste
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically on top of the biggest land@@ fill site of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments under F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all produced from the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article published by the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today , there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of re@@ manufactured material and which The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra calls itself .
a documentary named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic will follow the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the shared use of content .
back then in West Africa it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ dingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law break@@ er of this type on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it had not succeeded in catching fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia because of lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which prevents criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and help each other where illegal fishing is concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can damage the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the sn@@ ail stamp , with information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during port inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this makes it possible for authorities to identify ships fishing in prohibited areas - such as those who suggest that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships .
in the ideal case , such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license , where they were on the move , and eventually also whether they have a criminal law .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information . what does that mean that ships cannot sell their cargo ? and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , head director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultancy company that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front line
the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue that the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose each year because of the illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include sailing under false flag , fake license titles , indicating fantasy names , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non seamless control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front is working .
since its foundation F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious vessels .
it uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered vessels that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is building a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to detect suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , helps detect the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and provides technical support with F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information . it aims at helping F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Organization , Sky@@ Truth has recently opened the Global Fishing Watch platform : a platform that provides satellite data to display the position of each single track@@ able vessel worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting with neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also dis@@ courage them .
ships who had previously been fishing without a license and had little to reck@@ on with consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i now account for a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales since fishing boats are buying more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets on board where they were prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined together to form the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . . &quot; security is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; said Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag , was not only on the road without a license and used tow@@ ing nets that are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ek@@ 1 , they set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a unique collaborative working method to protect the oceans is actually working across the world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ turing the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on the National Revi@@ val , Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( roughly : Venezuela &apos;s regulator ) you can find pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also being held in other parts of the country , including the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally @-@ north district of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deteri@@ or@@ ate , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the removal of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the governmental decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine insi@@ sts , the referendum was considered as the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to establish a new government alliance .
the election alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( roughly : round table of Democratic unity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called for a majority of representatives from the opposition after the 2015 elections , and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government , should continue to block the referendum on the removal of the National Assembly .
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday national civil war and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming involvement of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and government pro@@ pon@@ ents .

on Twitter , pictures that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse are pil@@ ing up .
particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the central @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ staat T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile an info@@ graphic shows the amount of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an appeal procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s about this :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado state that 1 % of the signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your removal !
on the road !
others see these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which , from its point of view , has taken little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and rather has been pre@@ occupied with putting critical voices into silence :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing in intensity and frequency .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported that they were too hungry to take part in a strike rather than work or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
as an adult , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father in the large La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investigated crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was al@@ right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 at La Per@@ la prison from 1976 to 1978 .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the scale of atro@@ cities which he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the Sports Hall to the Military Support Centre
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there , I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you were friends with one of the ERP .
pass just that they do not kidn@@ ap you one day and I will have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
on the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoner .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&quot; there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me for the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were turned off and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
over there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ w@@ ed in and saw a couch where men were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they fixed the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just tied up there .
they rarely bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ flow it with water , and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was aw@@ ful ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that one man can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing eyes .
he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
near the entrance , people ch@@ ewed quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , several rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors from survivors the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial , went to death for the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path you came in here is also the path on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ a@@ era until the order from above came to be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time , at age , I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; was - as it knew it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military characters , which one has fought against .

but if you go into a house and steal the fridge , record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a war boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who st@@ ole cars in the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you by yourself .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
so my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought home clothing .
then the defense acc@@ using me of being a con@@ jur@@ er in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me under the burden of what they wanted .
I was there anyway to say .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &quot;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once children have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one continues to develop and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day , my father brought a girl with me , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why do their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families to whom they could hand over their mortal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that man can do .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ established , they brought machinery to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were grin@@ ded and buried somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course there is always something .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the idea of showing my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I was repro@@ ached for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience on his account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself what the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and forced me as a child to take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed . finally , I have declared against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 crimes : severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , murder in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

the judgments in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 Supp@@ res@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court handed out life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ war@@ ter terrorism
all def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military officers , former police officers and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic landmark for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people murdered or van@@ ished during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but research for this lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be established there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in K@@ YO@@ TO , where you can pro@@ long your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
adaptation of original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Kyoto Protocol , customers of a newly opened centre where one can pro@@ long his driver &apos;s license , witnessed a particularly un@@ successful translation during the last month .
on a sign , the Japanese word was the Japanese word . ( kor@@ ak@@ i@@ sha ) , which means &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts , &quot; fal@@ sely - perhaps also with malicious h@@ ul@@ ls &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has often been shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it be translated into English ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bad English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate drivers &quot; drivers drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture paid ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the exc@@ uses :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News took a closer look at the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country are quite grounds for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , representing a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors generated 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has dropped overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the named repor@@ ter , published in the article published on Yahoo , brought comments to the light showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to le@@ verage against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation error has among other things the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comment@@ aries .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ is@@ .com is a true treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre error in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and to speak active language skills in order to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could translate into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who themselves do not have foreign employees , can still make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose knowledge of English is considered the best , is made to translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the en@@ capsul@@ ated and en@@ ig@@ matic movements resulting from mechanical translations show that this technique cannot be replaced by any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints , often adorned with t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless to jewellery . but from big companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more dili@@ gent translations can be expected .
in the future , the Kyoto city will hopefully use a more rep@@ utable source of its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
other users later wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online channels also featured footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that oppose Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and deleg@@ ated the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link was tied up and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : enable your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites are re @-@ locked by Venezu@@ el@@ an providers .
this is from the web page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Menu Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened to punish them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw it as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ IT in@@ filtr@@ ated later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly deleg@@ ates its sessions .
earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server will respond err@@ atically to certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server will respond err@@ atically or refuse the request by calling such a website .
we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten while in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves in order to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ mean child as a child . she is now visiting the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ mean ta who have become victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Global Vo@@ ices , published by Global Vo@@ ices , with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly said about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as a Cri@@ mean for the family . as Cri@@ mean , in Paraguay there are more than 4@@ 6.000 girls and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money hands over their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , weal@@ thier family . in exchange , the child receives food , an education and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children will have to pay a number of days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be done - and all that in the context of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widely used in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ mean ta - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , as the feeling of gratitude in@@ oc@@ ulated to the Cri@@ mean is generally silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they conclude their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; is handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family that takes the girl with herself and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hid in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent strikes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant at the Res@@ ident Registration Office .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra beat on Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ mean .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they referred to Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without official documents it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children without imp@@ unity .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a spe@@ edy investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ min@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be a landmark case - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
everyday life of a Cri@@ mean
the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to en@@ rol for bank@@ rupt@@ cy , and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to go all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as a Cri@@ mean in the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in her employer &apos;s house , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours a day .
she had to share the time so that she still had time to learn .
she rose up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and infected the floor .
when the school ended , she went back home and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to take more books from the house &apos;s library than food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Par@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the Opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the host of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read edi@@ tori@@ als from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not behave with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone listening to while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; again there . &quot; this meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would return home to their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ .
they feared that they would lose the education they had made for it , they explained .
she was completely clear , however , that she paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work .
also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken about is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ mean ta when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realise that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ mean .
I was not able to invite anyone home to me . I had no circle of friends in the school or in the neighbourhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships were made , I noticed especially clearly that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job ads for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric girls in Paraguay .
the host is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon .

bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian representatives have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations regarding use and benefits of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the acceptance of the law , users must register with their correct names and identity numbers on the website of the site in order to be able to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , it could bring a punishment of up to six months in prison or a pen@@ alties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill consists of six paragra@@ phs and circul@@ ates in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any application running over the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be en@@ forced if it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should account for the registration of users who do not register because of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received from the telecommunications ministry a username and password &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come through the fire@@ wall blocking Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conduc@@ tive research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring it to a court process .
this is technically far from realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament &apos;s legislature and the constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensure that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was fores@@ een for those found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the Iraq war

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization &quot; Nature Iraq &quot; are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the greater family of le@@ op@@ ards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and thri@@ ving of the ecosystem also depends on the existence of a big car@@ ni@@ v@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video states that they have a picture of a big cat in the Camer@@ oon , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza is passion@@ ately fond of a different side of her country , which is not only made up of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring that protected areas for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region are established .

in early March 2017 , the Dutch daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; Three Times Cat@@ astrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a number of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring coun@@ ties Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was still experiencing an atomic accident , and that &apos;s why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of the people concerned themselves .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spar@@ rows were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
at the same time , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ uation of shelter lod@@ g@@ ings ( for the sake of cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) can be reloc@@ ated to final parts of the car .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees survived after the disaster in shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 1,@@ 0@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors again by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fisher@@ y h@@ ul@@ ls in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fisher@@ y har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have affected agr@@ arian land extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of the land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent of destroyed farm@@ land can be used again in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land are located in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , located in the &quot; nuclear shut @-@ off zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but again Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is still lag@@ ging behind .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal dw@@ ellers have found it more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to obtain an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ees . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her emp@@ athy has changed vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ ey@@ ed find that there is still not enough in cases of disaster prevention .
how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , disaster @-@ caused , atomic accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
out of 16@@ 0,000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63@@ ,000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been reloc@@ ated to permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 state , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees still live in homes , older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that one more unites than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives , and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to someone above language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music over@@ came the lack of shared language skills during a journey in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had beaten him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stick against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures nationwide .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him on Saturday and have now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local sculp@@ journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
the pictures also show the face of the police officer att@@ acking a stick . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the incident of the incident .
the pictures show the police officers , as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ ana with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and all the repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ ana , informed the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ e@@ dic@@ s shortly rush to him .
another video filmed with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilian rel@@ ays ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is hospit@@ alized .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been shared multiple times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish has been murdered by his father , because he has under@@ gone the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools , and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stick in his face .
police transgres@@ sions of the police
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to violent police forces against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers deployed rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters built a stage for speakers .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Pe@@ ac@@ eful Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refra@@ in from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have disgu@@ ised street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically informed about a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively shape their front pages with a photo .
O Global , on the other hand , O Global preferred a cover story with a brand @-@ set bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any form of damage to property .
here too the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence by the military police are obsc@@ ured by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on the confrontation course with the police . &quot;
the For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages For@@ gotten in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba joined the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it has been two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after that , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory continued to lose its plants until only the steel and concrete sm@@ ells remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who is rising every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active period are in operation again because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry off ?
the old platform of the church looked already better .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were out@@ dated and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the UN agricultural and food organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately $ 85 million for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will go into history &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane plants , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated the most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
these were officially recorded documents that would differ only with respect to the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was convic@@ ted and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he affir@@ med .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in whose construction he helped .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industry in Cuba and the most important workplace producer was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives for the jobs and services provided by the facilities in the communities in which they were located were created .
we will never know whether during the M@@ amm@@ oth @-@ Spe@@ ech of 21 October 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the present people when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
sugar cane has been extracted by grinding only high since 2004 .

after two years the people of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to dis@@ credit it , they also ceased to asp@@ ire to the road , and this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other businesses .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories .
they were replaced with spare parts .
without a future perspective many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production serves not even for the supply of the municipality .
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma plant , the ruins of the place where he began working .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand Peso a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a re@@ trac@@ table person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have tor@@ tured him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to reti@@ re at age 65 , not because he lacks strength , but because he is em@@ bit@@ tered .

first Nations people use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording of a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo taken with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
the young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do it through hip @-@ hop thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the pedago@@ gue David H@@ od@@ ges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ stars .
the workshop thereby increases that the young participants discuss topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &quot; Na A@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia says , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway to tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen usually indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to medi@@ ate how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influence of global@@ isation .
many of the songs have been published in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always know the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ en@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available , as is a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to keep my days on earth
this is the Day when you will hear our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
thus they can grow and also go forward to our youth
so they can do what the Creator determined for .
in the commentary part , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and is re@@ published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic courts are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( some of them ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan , plastic courts can be seen in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is right on the menu , near the entrance is sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( some of the &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) are displayed by any food served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ bo@@ gg@@ an area of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic courts are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend will change them today in show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile rib@@ bons decorated with plastic courts as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are some sho@@ dd@@ ly fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ic .
some mobile phone stands and cell phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ow , cool , now can I decorate my phone with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;m going to be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ ons made of dried salmon .
more qu@@ ir@@ ky plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the Twitter h@@ ash@@ tag # for the more .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic courts are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ si@@ sts and those who were killed regularly appear in stat@@ s . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle carries .
reporting about drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely repres@@ sed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with pain .
behind every body find behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who came into the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime does not only let us fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear changes life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells these stories exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a si@@ re looking for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews , in just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ ests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we are preparing ourselves for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15 , he was supposed to be back , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is with me here as well .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but you don &apos;t get them paid out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and the leadership of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with illness and sensation journ@@ alism for several years now .
every day I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be indiffer@@ ent or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me this is as if they are ridi@@ cul@@ ing those who have lost someone and those who are sc@@ ared that something happens to them .
I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified by the fact that they were &quot; so@@ ggy . &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they do not stir and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. of Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals black@@ ma@@ iled money from their business for month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of all that you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trauma is left , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also changed .
we only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her account with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked me if tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organized crime ?
what is it like to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about her .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his inf@@ ancy ended .
his childhood had passed two years earlier when he was just a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence by organised crime and the fight against it ming@@ led with the existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Public Security Council and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this equ@@ ates to 8.5 assass@@ ination per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages to which he links contain pictures on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or false , tends to pers@@ ist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and rav@@ aged it . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es which were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to the victim .
official representatives described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby , full of people watching the World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to be un@@ recognis@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple photos of the incident reflect the horri@@ ble scenes of that day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies lined up on the ground while persons look at them .
but here the story does not come to an end .
over the years the same photo has been taken up several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters from the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on in the remote areas of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses have reported a lot of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ p@@ ses lay in roads and bushes .
there were reports , according to which between 150 and 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the following time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the Nig@@ eri@@ as military and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
one more step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely affect the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash report published by the United Nations , those who could flee could strike , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following appeared that brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , fal@@ sely claiming to be the president of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein , monks and politicians were involved in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source had fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein His statement , but had not related the image of the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false links extend back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an in@@ verse picture search with the search engine Tin@@ u has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned picture from the DR Congo .
they originate from a mixed mas@@ h of private parties , platforms of social media and common as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , some have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have set aside examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which side they have been published , so we want to represent the reach more clearly than through the language alone .
several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use can be derived from the countries listed below ( which were also inter@@ connected in some cases ) .
here are some cases which can still be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers , where examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications are still available .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Ink Eye , are likely to demonstrate counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

true or false ? ) .
one side , which makes rum@@ ors stand out , questioned the fact that the said photo shows Christians killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City will not only mention fal@@ seh@@ ood but also disc@@ usses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies that are involved in it ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los cris@@ ti@@ an@@ os &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in north @-@ can@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca quotes the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; there are clearly no sides like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that refu@@ te this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the flaw@@ ed use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post by U.S. , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate in silence . &quot;
this article pointed out the continuing need of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quoted the work of an article by Indian Express with the image from the DR Congo ; the article by Indian Express didn &apos;t contain this picture at the time of publication of our article .

this page used the image as evidence that Muslims were killing Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fac@@ t@@ check page in 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a federation of students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the old city district P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o of Tren@@ to posted this news to his side in order to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo as proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano was divided into public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , the sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to del@@ timi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , as the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a vision of what it meant as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately in@@ secure news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this adjustment , which was published exclusively in English , also contains references to fake images of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding molecules used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to suggest that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by the Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; a f@@ atten@@ ing with a book ? &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein had admitted to 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , Catholic nearby news page An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo showed up with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events which presum@@ ably took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and res@@ cu@@ ed more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message which was allegedly written by a &quot; Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a ho@@ ax .
from the embassy in which the picture was taken from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos stood afar off .
there are more confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
Tin@@ u also points out to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the map in Gra@@ y ) , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and some of them have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used with regard to greater discussions on the silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming is used to discuss how African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share in drinking water around a tragedy .
does this mood suggest false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and em@@ bel@@ lish the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the dis@@ semination of violent pictures has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images may sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and audience and take the ability to emp@@ ath@@ ise emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , which investigated how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be derived from the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , every study of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

a blog called un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ sur@@ pass@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese bree@@ ders ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ ota ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly trying a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the Van@@ u@@ at@@ u Mw@@ ic@@ time language , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - we@@ ary around your parents in recognition of how you have tried around you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after you have been war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they in@@ filtr@@ ate other cultures , reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite itiner@@ aries here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon which normally starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ tan@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement by the Sri L@@ ank@@ an disaster response from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missed because of floods and slu@@ dge waves .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe places of residence .
the rainf@@ alls ceased on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas were slowly returning .
health and hygiene of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ w@@ ana town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the crisis of the Den@@ gue , warns Save the Children , after more rainf@@ alls are already on its way .
today morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations , and another five will be completed for the transport of emergency supplies to the inhabitants en@@ rolled in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ bas .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this field .
the taxi @-@ call app &quot; Pick@@ Me &quot; ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the app so that the cad@@ ast@@ op@@ ic centre is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ ups introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for assistance and donations . these were then transmitted free of charge to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also included a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents into emergency and provide help .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , and Sri Lanka &apos;s population is now facing the long road to restoring norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
I entr@@ ust her to her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts in me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call even slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we are chann@@ eling rights for trans@@ gender people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , tied from an American flag , others ch@@ ew slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; I ask .
I have already managed this conversation .
people I have been working with or who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know it - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in its imagination .
they are mi@@ tig@@ ating me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put in the same Muslim pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hole .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims who do not fit in there are mi@@ tig@@ ated .
must be mi@@ tig@@ ated
I &apos;m not alone with it .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures come to mind when you think of him ?
love for me ?
peace ? yes , peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western conception , Rum@@ i &apos;s religion was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this deletion makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists in the ab@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ posed the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images continue to stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood will continue to ste@@ er them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forced Saudi , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ ration weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct changes for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought to this by slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
this narrative has taken our collective imagination so deep and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh sen@@ iors and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion include
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has f@@ abul@@ ously failed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims in the highest degree make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ American people .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first design design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan res@@ ig@@ ned the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslims and Americans .
but am I now an unavoid@@ able Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of fet@@ ching my Muslim recipes or carrying out my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims carry - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing volume of a well @-@ forged Islam@@ ism machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , which have manipul@@ ated our already faulty picture of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stranger that tears a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below .

I would like to explain that .
I was born as Muslims , but to be a Muslim was only born in my imagination when I was four years old in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they go back to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my friend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims if it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I hold her in my arms and whis@@ per her Arabic verses to protect the Qur &apos;@@ an , which seal the Qur &apos;@@ an and be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the author &apos;s grand@@ mother when she wins an ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother on my mother &apos;s side with her sisters ; as she decades ago win a contest of art of floral arrangements in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I close my eyes when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim is to say the prayers that she told me to speak when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how it taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who , for centuries , have been col@@ oni@@ zed by an &quot; empire &quot; that a company founded with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan reserved for his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family , whom he was not allowed to close in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at play risk .
to be Muslims is to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have been &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; all the way up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was thrown down over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir subject of the British Empire , was referred to by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he was the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim strain of 1.7 billion go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means to recall that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent from Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to hunt weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if tragedy hits the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first cry of prayer called Az@@ aan was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people over@@ came the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives count .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ist , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , den@@ otes the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ junc@@ tions , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons on this duality er@@ ect structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it is in continuous supervision of mos@@ ques .
she is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders with people from just the countries who are bom@@ bing it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we have to ab@@ ject to Muslim lands .
due to the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists at the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically un@@ real picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims gain the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply dar@@ ed to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have been back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous ima@@ gery we perpet@@ u@@ ate in our news editorial .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square via black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero - all this gives me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who exist in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was un@@ aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who have made me an un@@ disputed Muslim today .
things I have left here like a bread baking Tra@@ m in my speech .
things that may awaken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , there may be a story where someone is being made to be &quot; others . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations are taking place during the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .
poster of the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ face of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia Studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where yet Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be w@@ aged and people have been dealt with by creating the &quot; others &quot; in public performance four decades ago was a scientist of Stan@@ ford himself .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; ; just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we had not pres@@ ided over the chocolate cake as he already bombar@@ ded broken lands and &quot; other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the multitude of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , there is the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the feasibility of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; listening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is often linked to understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers put their story first in their own language and then translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller , their devotion and representation mean that the audience becomes aware of it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the D@@ af@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also took the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells us the f@@ able of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened to !
they were alert ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to extend it . all inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling .
Puerto Rico calls for re@@ establishment of sovereign debt from the United States
with the aim of a new audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which rose to USD 72 million , several religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 ; the march began with the South African Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizens front for the neur@@ al@@ ex@@ ams of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ establishment of debts have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for debts are held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed remuneration , which is appropriate to our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on government responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state &apos;s infrastructure .
without the participation and conviction of citizens , the measures imposed on the outside will take the risk of being rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration bore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night vi@@ gi@@ l for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

artists and writers honor the work of the missing Syrian developer Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and family members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin , there was an event of the # Free@@ BS@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house published by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book published last year , and is available free of charge , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book aims to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison where he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Memory gives to his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , immediately .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as an in@@ sider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his place of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bass@@ el founded , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more predic@@ tive than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ road of many civili@@ zations and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el could not know at that time that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to wipe out the architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this journey into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project so far .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I &apos;m overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other det@@ ain@@ ees how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ bio@@ diary she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .

Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or forced to use force by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our call in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : Director sentenced to previous post due to corruption
Moz@@ ambique responded by anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed .
he was arrested in 2008 and , together with four other def@@ end@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison , together with four other def@@ end@@ ants ( around 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public money from Moz@@ ambique &apos;s airports , whose council was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for its re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which submitted the application , there would be no hin@@ dran@@ ce for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many people don &apos;t appro@@ ve the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to put the director back in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with respect to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary proceedings against the contrary .
however , the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the appropriate functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent person , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been served .
he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an and a student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no moral code :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted it . I can &apos;t believe that you reward someone who has so mas@@ sively insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing mor@@ als to return and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man , who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ t pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in jail :
thi@@ eves are in prison Sam@@ ah Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as the first independent President , but also as a sharp , one @-@ ed@@ der and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral presentations was , when he firmly confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of anything , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ah also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and was released .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ inters . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the familiar social network accepted their posts from the web because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still being discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin , or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the very last ( in Burma ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ atory conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts in order to use the word have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ ath@@ lete A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post by one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty manner if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a play of words .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical , before it del@@ etes all posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook doesn &apos;t delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words on the opposite side .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech have received a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to cur@@ tail their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who propag@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternate sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; didn &apos;t correspond to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a multitude of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post , the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Kh@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring even more hatred within the different communities .
it seems as though they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; sen@@ sen@@ curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they discovered that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they only had a bit more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun via Facebook and consciously do not write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate language , but were removed anyway :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
only to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is meant to heat up violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where clas@@ hes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to control the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked more current , more focused on context than initiatives focusing on code and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is close to the to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .

the inf@@ ant &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously decided on a law to ban this practice so that the age @-@ capable age is now 18 .
in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter @-@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group that gathered representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN statistics for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 were in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , stri@@ ves to aboli@@ sh laws for inf@@ ant @-@ marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition paved the way for tensions in this un@@ complicated case , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was adopted against the children &apos;s he@@ e - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and not a single one on the other .
after it was decided previously in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were thri@@ lled because the laws on the children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has obsc@@ ured the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the inf@@ ant &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel was in the opinion that it took long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says , Her@@ vor@@ ra@@ ging news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
following the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a civil society group that said quite frank@@ ly how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the marriage age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the change of the marriage network was adopted today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs who were against have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inf@@ ant &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed by law in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ bearing par@@ rot .
many thanks to all activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law was to be adopted , and he seems to release his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said that it was quite lawful for Mahar@@ aj to act against the law , most social media users desired to approach the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ m@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , instead of keeping the discussion so general , in a way that can only cause panic and anger when we , instead of talking about the problem , that we , instead of addressing the problem , would say that the state , our daughters against it , would be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in advantage to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

Turkish users can see Wikipedia content again by mirr@@ oring web pages
the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright Act in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular Wikipedia @-@ based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day , it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
although many technologi@@ cally experienced Internet users are used to using editing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence ) , most common Wikipedia entries do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship from Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) as the platform put down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its dedicated pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer @-@ computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is however irre@@ voc@@ able despite legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the block@@ age from Wikipedia ) , we all decided to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IPC platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents on decentr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently from the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors , if in their respective country Wikipedia is blocked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a black r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poor@@ ly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps him :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I was at home strai@@ gh@@ ta@@ way when suddenly I called Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kin@@ dle pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know , for he was already facing tig@@ ers face to face face to face :
a tiger can not distur@@ b himself from the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the King of Bu@@ de@@ k appeared . he sits down immediately , we look at him and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for conservation ) on its photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to shoot at the Bar@@ dia National Park shots of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with the utmost care avoid speaking the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm to keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a bo@@ g@@ us court and viol@@ ated her family and village community after she had addressed a married couple with names .
the tradition of ow@@ ning their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of discussion in the city .
it is a place for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the Camp@@ aig@@ n # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to disman@@ tling the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ste has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera in the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage and the bann@@ ishing of HIV and AIDS infected , and manages these clubs .
it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion was about women who didn &apos;t call their hus@@ bands on their names .
she chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands lou@@ dly is a custom they have committed and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that up to this discussion , we have never thought about it .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home how it works .
she showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ cht from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so shy that she was hiding in front of her throughout the exercise ; another decided to let out the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by curse him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
even in the rush of adren@@ aline , having broken with an age @-@ old tradition , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands on their names at home .
and they kept their word .
over the next few days Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman &apos;s husband was less understanding and the situation art@@ ete into violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the vermi@@ lion dot on the forehead that indicates the mar@@ ital status :
why must women show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would carry the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he did it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not completely left with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I &apos;ve been working on these problems for so many years and yet I &apos;ve never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they happen to one .
in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ted @-@ cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over trousers ; they did not dare .
after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , morality combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini gave her own couple of cur@@ tas ( Ober@@ shirts ) into a discussion forum , so the women could wear them .
next , they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini are sure they will be able to do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far , we have only taken small steps .
some women tried it for a couple of times , but then they stopped saying the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot at any time on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like viol@@ ets for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on 29th June of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was at the end of the day . all the best ( The Beat@@ les Day of the Year ) was to be found in the jap@@ an@@ ese Twitter trend , where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , observed the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit in 2016 :
for just five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here have become quite clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cult band &apos;s music is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language as English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . some 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo .
even today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today is the Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places related to the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be qu@@ ir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today is the Beat@@ les memorial day .
right now in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year as well .
and of course , some companies also use the fan community in terms of market conditions , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen N@@ ood@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going to run today .
so , we hope that you are there !
follow the h@@ ash@@ tag , the parts of the bow , the best way to learn more about the Beat@@ les memorial day .
bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia police warned the population that bald men could be in Moz@@ ambique &apos;s aim of attacks .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ shops , presum@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
it gives the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia claimed the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 mission in the South African country to carry out a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique hit men in Moz@@ ambique &apos;s goal of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an police according to the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ ination took place .
Hus@@ ky Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the prosecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ bi@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presum@@ ably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power that generate wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a told the chron@@ ic@@ le of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ C@@ TE GER@@ MAN GER@@ MAN GER@@ MAN , THE S@@ ME is ashamed of a country where people would have shame to go to the streets , and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a land where neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; would be hun@@ ted , which aim to get material wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re hum@@ our .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ bi@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police officer Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both are :

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong &apos;s Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o drew attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ing ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred Li@@ u case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man said he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China is still receiving calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict handling of the pair in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summari@@ zed some reactions abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China , as exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
the European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u as she announced in a statement on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA Shop in the USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ ch informed that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad in so far as it can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced AF@@ P news agency on 27 June that the message urged the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy calls for an angry response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley informed that China should offer to the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system , as well as international obligations .
U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so that he can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany Attrac@@ tions in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , that Li@@ u receives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
earlier diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had big concerns whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :
Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression and freedom of expression for the exercise of these rights .
France and the world
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually record it .
Taiwan Ob@@ its in Taiwan
the Council of Land Affairs in Taiwan challenged China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu @-@ M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u , of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with Li@@ u in a statement on June 28 and stated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it seemed like an attempt to escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very noble : he advoc@@ ated an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in the face of this , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers , who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , abandoned the twi@@ sted logic , as it fits better to its power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam offered answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he disgu@@ ised the corresponding questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies of a rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng demands Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to make clear his mind as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clear this point , provided that he was paid high to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the whole tran@@ script of the conference so that the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam could be better understood , according to Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the cap@@ tion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities witnessed a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard that was waiting for me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that , is properly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ assem@@ bles the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam committed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered to be an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it &apos;s equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave significance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they defend only their town but not their country ?
who must our Prime Minister pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Singapore is , and has always been a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather talk about the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are being exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question I &apos;m most asked about in Japan reads : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan again and again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
&quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - in front of Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada allegedly is also considered to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t mind if you would conf@@ use me , for example , with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be sp@@ it - like the ben@@ ign , soft but lo@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders out of &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can push yourself .
to be harmless is to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
it can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbours .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I am now connecting with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ fre@@ es Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the j@@ un@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man talking about what prescri@@ ptions his girlfriend makes .
although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times shared and received 8,@@ 800 likes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army an absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program of the &quot; adjustment change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are viewed by the j@@ un@@ ta as a critic .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army which over@@ sees online content and prosec@@ utes individuals who are accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand sets a strict stance against &quot; Read Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ esty compensation ) .
on 20 May 2014 war law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems the j@@ un@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video even shows how persons are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they are supposed to have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in Eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia bin@@ s .
various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Sou@@ theast Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ kov@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are in decay and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all serving the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ che@@ v , which still accommodate one or two families , can be seen at the balconies , where clothes are dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in hand , they pull back immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable farming .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she admitted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells them that they and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s inter@@ viewer , Nat@@ ascha , lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she rec@@ alls the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child benefit for every child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time they lost their anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
actually , it actually has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation tends to end , a little boy runs past us .
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and is hiding .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
while they run , some of them throw rocks on the ru@@ ined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which provide for in@@ descri@@ b@@ ability in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner P@@ RI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of the migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is run by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold colored ear@@ ring in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants come here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , says Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , people come in full mini buses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ i@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on boxes outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication they cannot pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a sta@@ che side@@ burns ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
the family had heard from other companions from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking about Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez &apos;s W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his trip to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mr@@ s Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests are often sending text messages when they have gone to greet them or report on their journey over the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city is a blind al@@ ley to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants to their little house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and a Un@@ known , a single @-@ educ@@ ator , offered him its roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step should take .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , passengers are quietly navig@@ ating their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she sc@@ apes in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair we@@ aving , she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she puts it briefly before me .
&quot; Ya is fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones .
a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities area in western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi got a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities could use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after installing the app , exchanged messages with a private wo@@ chat group .
the police informed that the app would investigate and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , ebooks and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ king &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , repres@@ sed ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often set extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet , &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point in which polic@@ emen tested the inhabitants random@@ ly to see if they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , you may be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced the people to use appliances intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China , &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which shows that the software can raise the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and affiliated facilities , including universities and research institutions , are required to follow the instructions of cy@@ ber security office during the operation of their computers and communication devices .
freedom House &apos;s current report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued a decree to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police until August 1 .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; this action , however , viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es to death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian jail .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything important is gone .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable both from inside and outside .
one that makes all honor to their name .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es to death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence even if the Earth is spinning on the axis of the evil . it is clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone erected around stone .
they have arrested me and my father thri@@ ce , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I didn &apos;t set high demands on a city which has been blocked up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice reson@@ ate with silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to find them together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we were united to a magnificent picture full of my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you have freed the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low down - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of security service .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not in the vicinity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was because of my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice again since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest maintenance that could have such disa@@ strous consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed movement lies in my nose until today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a psych@@ ic torture that I was subjected to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I run through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I was impressed by all the details before I took care of the space .
otherwise they have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share them with only one single prisoner and may immediately sit down without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I went back to a tried and tested method of communication : to beat the wall with the fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first prisoner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle aged man , who looks like me and is called the doctor .
in perfect darkness there are no visible facial features in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remained .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all those crow@@ s who lab@@ ored in the fruits of my head &apos;s garden .
from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams sound , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of corruption until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th Sur@@ a of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this revealed the secret : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from releasing the tra@@ it@@ or and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Albanian dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world@@ view .
this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a lean and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me that way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation despite the facial expressions that are der@@ ailed to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join those Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ sts and protest demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have gotten used to it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly chat .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had not done anything to deserve this punishment .
in punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ fession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your hang@@ man delights in your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t hold back your cri@@ es .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him yet , which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had worked as a waste collector before or if that belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed while I was still in line .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not take pleasure in doing so , which is why he acted as the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply all my neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours , he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours went , which seemed to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted person : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father needs to be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and go , you &apos;ll be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photograph was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; at times he hur@@ ts to his screen , to his computer , back and back to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ e@@ ye@@ es ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questions their tried @-@ and @-@ true opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are relevant not only in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to the whole of Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his thinking , and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he h@@ ates a special a@@ version against U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
taken by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation . &quot; so he describes himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured in water soluble N@@ es@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching j@@ un@@ days has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the gn@@ at of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - like drinking water in the public during Ram@@ adan - in order not to land in prison .
the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan recently canc@@ eled an appearance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contra@@ ven@@ es the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert @-@ cancellation .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition , Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b , said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the tried and true legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the whole region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la cher@@ ished the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continued to choose &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b moved traditional gender norms to bodies by depicting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the image shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently stri@@ ped unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in the past few years the number of &quot; honour mor@@ als &quot; has increased in Jordan - un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour mor@@ als reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan has no institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on crime prevention from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in jail for an in@@ definite period of time , &quot; and for their release there is often a need for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the family &apos;s guarantee that the woman will not do anything .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music also enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for not to shy away from themes that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political but ad@@ mits that he cannot divor@@ ce his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been tri@@ cked in me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tackl@@ es the question of Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ is@@ eb , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comment@@ aries on gender equality have still been strongly cens@@ ored by 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later re@@ mark that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly advoc@@ ates for the Arab LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ a , a poet of the eighth century , still remember@@ ing today , thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ was , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why cannot Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ?
the real problem , such as H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former government representatives and members of the teacher association , stating that on social media comment@@ aries they have expressed cri@@ tically about the problems associated with the deeply rooted corruption in the country .
in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now fought M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that &apos;s how it looks like H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and inner changes .
ultimately , like millions of other Arabs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing them . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and on an artificial way of cra@@ ving demo@@ cra@@ cies .
until that time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will ra@@ p and consequently resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one assumes that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many parts of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ u . another theory states that the ar@@ rests , the drums and dancing have been handed over over a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan have mar@@ ched to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ ant , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ ula Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ u@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high fortress was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

out@@ ward appearance and body care rarely were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate occupation such as the hair@@ dres@@ sers .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high rate of crime , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the un@@ parall@@ eled demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks on how to watch in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school of Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive education in the bar@@ ber art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of its achievements :
in 1995 we were the only vocational school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : letters of love to guer@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the revised version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love Messenger of guer@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
is it not much more important to meet people who feel exp@@ elled ?
this is precisely the question of the young Colum@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ a Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Cart@@ a p@@ or la Cu@@ li@@ aci@@ Ã³n campaign ( letters for reconciliation ) encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ illa fighters .
it was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
in front of the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of genuine reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock , now have to re@@ integrate themselves into civilian life .
the Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in perpet@@ ual fear , and in some cases deep hatred of guer@@ illa fighters , must now commen@@ ce it in its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : so far , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter who will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the atonement was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he continued to say that this year he shared his love with people need@@ ing the most pressing response .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters who now find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the F@@ ARC members stood up as they previously had done to counter@@ act the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in @-@ between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter took me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL Pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , and tired of being the faithful companion of this warri@@ or , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else of life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
so far , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices and voices
at the start , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders came together for a discussion .
the students were all grown up as already war , and the ARC was already in secret .
for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , its ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice was exer@@ ting on the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can contribute to making society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I had often seen and hate as monsters , even people with beautiful emotions that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country is living hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people , including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former comb@@ at@@ ants responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp command@@ ant in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ fur de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would prevail after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now focusing on peace , on a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call upon all the def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with terror activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by the local LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community is not only about night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
several months ago , the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya conquered the international head@@ lines after reports were published that addressed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ as@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , throwing a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens heard about the gender equality of their land woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the round .
on October 10 , 2015 I was attacked .
when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from my car rear seat , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but nothing hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you sc@@ and@@ y ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and began to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two cuts in my right lung .
OC Media : in which case were you laid - in which of the men or the women ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it , but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I first read his name at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that this was all a lie .
they made absurd demands : some told me that I must prove it by running through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that all was only fla@@ iling , and Photos@@ hop .
I have body size C - what should I have said on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has humili@@ ated not only your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 was placed under the window .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was a bit la@@ zy .
my human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I still can &apos;t grasp how it could be .
just before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without registering myself , without any evidence , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother using W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you plug . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : just with my mother and sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to avoid inj@@ uring her .
when we chat with camera , I am actually trying to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have remained dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has been in gun for one and a half months .
he told that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not exclude a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still being captured in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
if , especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to settle for Kad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports about this yet . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve been wearing my hair forever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us closer to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had d@@ yed lashes , wore tu@@ bular je@@ ans and short tops .
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria has never touched me even one hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da@@ h K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one often says it to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never ch@@ ased , and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ad@@ ens@@ zeit hold ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped onto the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he spoke not about us per se but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could sense how people started to change in the city .
those who had previously laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly wor@@ sen@@ ing .
OC Media : which activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I &apos;m still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I do not spend a cent for it .
I discovered these people by myself when I cl@@ apped aside places of refuge .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ ro@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
so nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
that &apos;s exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to fool you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no bo@@ ils with them .
the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ ians have which , the cab@@ ar@@ ins , which the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
do you know many think about transi@@ indiffer@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences . but this is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling , to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in su@@ ici@@ des within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab communities in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ mad region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
there has been a sharp increase in suicide since the last few months .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 re@@ treated the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ mad community in Iran characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ v@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability for his family to arise , so Ah@@ mad @-@ human rights groups who wish to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared to YouTube held the moments after he had burned himself .
some people made it quick to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ mad .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ mad Min@@ ority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ti@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ o , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families on account of their persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where most of Iran &apos;s indigenous Arab communities live in Iran , was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livel@@ ih@@ oods .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran as well as some of the rich@@ est and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime is systematically den@@ ying the Ah@@ ti@@ zi Arabs to systematically create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territory , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by d@@ rought in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ ks grew to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co @-@ operation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and 45 % had a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ shi@@ i , an Iranian @-@ based human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ mad men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans coming up in Ah@@ ra@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ v@@ az@@ i is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aiming to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside their home of Ah@@ mad .
there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ mad and be hired , since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ mad people have to endure , human rights activists oppose the alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional isn &apos;t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ ich@@ .@@ This article was originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even show well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists * inside .
for example , despite the same education women still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict supervision when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex passes through the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and well known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old underneath .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to talk on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have been ab@@ used physically , emo@@ tionally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists decided to remain silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all people of all skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injus@@ tices in her thinking , which relate both to sex and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and even I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a degra@@ ded and margin@@ alized creature in historical terms .
I refuse to join groups who also by cultural appropri@@ ation absorb our customs and customs to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them to a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that has been created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than applying for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ ans : reco@@ laim@@ ing ( such as : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks about how we can defend ourselves by defining our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they can be completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because I exist in this paradig@@ m .
I am recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a Content @-@ Sharing Agreement , this article will be published again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , un@@ noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their own way .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ ative . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( # consec@@ u@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) , who reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names were changed for the protection of the persons affected .
a police inspec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent to her .
since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be laid to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed due to mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos;s know@@ led@@ geable display did nothing .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her advertisement .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women pay any complaint at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , admit to be victims of violence , must contact the law enforcement authorities at all .
cont@@ ent@@ 1 blows and statisti@@ c 2 un@@ seen mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , poor implementation hits and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centre de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studio , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports , which do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 the District At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office opened 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of it was violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of the ads of women came here as well .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister , Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; on any woman who will be ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of mental abuse , 9 women who do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for every woman who will be ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder is not a crime in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot properly document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of men &apos;s violence .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but after that she had to repent .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
I would never have thought that I would become a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that that only happened to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse caused by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote contributions on Facebook , in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two years relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some of their inno@@ c@@ ence .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the Paraguay authorities to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all in any way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others don &apos;t do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case , everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s adver@@ ts at the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not being applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in the application of laws in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament on 10 August 2016 , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # for@@ you ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ deser@@ ved ) movement are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain and har@@ den Fem@@ ini@@ d as an independent criminal record , as is already the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legislative text was changed in a number of ways in order to also attract the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years in prison .
the original bill fores@@ een that the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which the victims of violence must carry on themselves , if they simply only reimbur@@ se them and would like to receive a secure accommodation , lay down the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts are complic@@ it and contribute to the perpet@@ r@@ ator being offen@@ ded .
we need to refund for such a long time until there is no more mal@@ treatment than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law were changed , among other things a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman continued to attack a year after a newspaper was banned
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked by a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Chinese authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he serves a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i were also arrested and brought to court , but later released again .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after completing his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the sul@@ tan domin@@ ance is characterised by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic secret services , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting and det@@ ecting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restric@@ ts peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and restric@@ ts citizens , including activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspapers Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and the detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for the freedom of the press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its foundation in 2007 , corruption was reported in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested on 28 July 2016 , after an article was published in the paper on 26 July 2016 with the title of &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of justice . &quot; it was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having pres@@ sured Ju@@ dge of the Supreme Court of Oman into an inheritance case .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited to the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS placed the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief on Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information gave the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper is prohibited by any means , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the trial in Mas@@ k@@ at .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final shut@@ down of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , inter alia , for distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of breach of publication ban and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three year imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) , and a one @-@ year ban imposed on the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
a security deposit of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was set for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pr@@ ison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he serves his one @-@ year sentence .
in addition , the Appe@@ als Court ann@@ ul@@ led the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the paper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper is still facing attacks by the Brazilian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with what the minister once again opposed the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to allow the publication of the newspaper again .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper aren &apos;t the only cases in which the press freedom in Oman has recently been viol@@ ated .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the Chinese authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom .
Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is calling on the authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j will release immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspapers Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman un@@ hin@@ der their legitimate human rights work and exercise without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his agreement
medical research in Africa is seldom or even not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have much more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment to research these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Research on Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the National Anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) programme with laboratory tests .
I also have a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what are the most important current science topics in your country and in Africa in general ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a recipient instead of being a creator himself .
the solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
Q : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here , because financing and opportunities for development are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa against Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it &apos;s often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can only make articles accessible for payment ( called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems around the world .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been ra@@ ging salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ puts Gor@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ ef@@ ulness and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding .
the patents applied not only to individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green ton or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or grape varieties . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mor@@ ton is still growing salad , but now he needs longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river , around which I have to d@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads .
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new kind of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , he is very cau@@ tious and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman bal@@ sam@@ ic of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed ) is inspired by the free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant bree@@ ders .
in the context of the initiative , briefly called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who purchase their seeds , cross it to breed so own varieties and not immediately cut it out - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
more glo@@ omy prospects
for the Emer@@ itus Professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i Executive Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as environmental protection .
seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , the latest examples are the amal@@ gam@@ ations of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Bayer , as it is offered for example on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables are bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seed is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available to others , as opposed to pat@@ enting seeds and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool shr@@ inks un@@ steadily due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material which is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all key features are protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant bree@@ ders at all or only complic@@ ates .
there are no estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that large @-@ scale crops such as wheat are patented in a larger scale than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those , through which their taste or colour improves to such , because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property claims other bree@@ ders as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant vari@@ et@@ als promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not prevent innovations , but it promotes them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed crops adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is , however , that genetic resources have always been a common good and must remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers their work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will make us impossible if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create the features really themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they form the plants themselves and as bree@@ ders we have no idea how the plants do so .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also put their own values into it .
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation requires massive her@@ bi@@ cides , is breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets but are smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they create the most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton also believes that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m experim@@ enting with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it very simple in my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the USA seems to be the leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , implements an open source seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crop plants , the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ col works on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding vary from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
one explanation , however , is not yet a law ; it is now in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for open source seed systems , states that the organization is currently building a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for which scheduled next year will be the official launch .
a combination of environment protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , published a report from aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policies to ensure stable food supplies .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context , from which Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there &apos;s even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian authorities are still blocking contents on the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the Web site of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on that .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true to its goal in defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ H@@ RI has confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the block@@ age and not to yield . we ins@@ ist on carrying out our mission further .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of wave of web page lock@@ outs fell victim to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of Colum@@ ns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible to Egypt .
now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , was itself the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , on the other hand is more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting on the student protests and recorded a video on how police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s locking and reflected what it means to him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blo@@ gging of blo@@ gs might not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) I managed to convey the feeling of a state of siege ; arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blo@@ gs of blo@@ gs as well as any other web site I worked for .
2 ) They proved that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ a@@ geous are walking their way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked out 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , by b@@ yp@@ assing Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the block@@ age of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are being made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis on which it can act against these acts in court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

newspapers report day after day newspapers all over Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; At the second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves ro@@ b the pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ ier sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air tea to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a stra@@ ined financial situation , the 2017 violence threshold reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
thus , the paper published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , titled &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything that happens in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ ards , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a martial law in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 sites controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the paper writes :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise atro@@ cities committed by the police who only sho@@ ots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ ila Oli@@ v@@ eira ev@@ okes the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is , in her opinion , a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to give accoun@@ t@@ ability to the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent negl@@ ect of public service .
remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north @-@ east of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mor@@ ats per federal state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for years .
these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by using a massive police force and to permanently in@@ firm a unit .
in the beginning , however , this led to a decline of violent deaths . for some years , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles in 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not meet the criteria set out by the Geneva Con@@ ventions - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for human beings .
this calls upon the state to use means and means typical of a war . this involves entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a Zi@@ vi@@ list is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
one week it is now that the police sei@@ zes the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the middle of all this violence , this incident made head@@ lines : a fruit sellers died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories in Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute , The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack of chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded life of hundreds of civilians , is particularly affected .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been besieg@@ ed outside Damascus , which led to the fact that residents are dependent on locally produced or cann@@ ed food caused by tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food @-@ grown food in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to AF@@ P , the French news agency :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it is becoming more and more known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , you can use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families with the knowledge of planting mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around â¬ 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to raise funds on Can@@ do until Monday 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they started the &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cart@@ on , etc ) for the production of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , who are bound to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea across the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interview with Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la was conducted by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and translated by Elias A@@ bo@@ u Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people were prot@@ esting on 21 October in many capitals in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week of solidarity with the victims for a period of three days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 bur@@ sts of fire that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors forest areas by satellite photos , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can take a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
all of Portugal burns within the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

numerous videos spread across the web and show images that allow better insights into what is going on :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protest on Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil defence was unable to contain the scale of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o So@@ ver@@ al of the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do so : there are dozens of reports of open roads closed by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the woods of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy could have happened as in June , as the roads were blocked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with high fire risk .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for forest reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees from easily inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread more and more after fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the Civil Protection Web site of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents were seeking information or trying to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used the own civil protection data with the help of the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and became so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the server did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

in a night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Tali@@ ban began .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups defeated by the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
at the same time , A@@ shar@@ pen Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the Eth@@ nic group of Haz@@ ara , was in G@@ haz@@ ni Province in Central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner .
even if his mother hadn &apos;t said it at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - perhaps never again .
the boy was supposed to break in the morning .
his unc@@ le would fetch him and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

overview of the CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been assass@@ inated by the Tali@@ ban , and many haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ protected .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his small salary and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars heavier than he himself , in order to earn his living .
back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; rec@@ alled A@@ shar@@ pen in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ pen had left his life without any official papers in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing over the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
after the Greek authorities rejected asylum application , A@@ shar@@ er came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af hom@@ eless , walking alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to help needy twice a day .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high response rates is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are disa@@ strous .
the Human Rights Organisation of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ qualified personnel . &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an admission centre , if they have officially submitted a request for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
and that &apos;s how it was A@@ shar@@ pen .
but his unc@@ row@@ ful life @-@ willing hel@@ per helped A@@ shar@@ pen free himself from these conditions .
after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put all his savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast meal .
A@@ shar@@ pen Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans run businesses , including dres@@ s@@ making , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant ori@@ ental Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pa@@ dua . Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets go far beyond the Italian food and retail trade and go back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ pen with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ pen has also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ pen has made this journey for himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey .
N@@ eti@@ zen Report : Egypt &apos;s bills allow shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , in detention for more than 900 days .
he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the release of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
share from @ C@@ il@@ un@@ a@@ 27 on Twitter .
global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys N@@ eti@@ zen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet Rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registration with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users must register to use social networks within six months of the successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the removal of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , applied by 60 members of parliament , is currently under the control of the Legisl@@ ative Committee and the Constitutional Committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
another MP handed over a legislative proposal in May in which har@@ sh@@ er pun@@ ish@@ ments would be introduced for the insul@@ t of the president or a high official .
under Egyptian law , the en@@ vi@@ ro@@ ment of the President and the state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the legislative proposal , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , such as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison on a court date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the def@@ end@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatened with the death penalty as a result of one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ light from among others weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iz@@ a reported the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ mor@@ si seating block at the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists to inter@@ ce@@ de on le@@ aked documents
in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was largely inter@@ ro@@ gated to an en@@ chan@@ ted action plan . said Plan stems from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would acc@@ use business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all illeg@@ ally received mon@@ ies .
the document published on April 21 on the web site of Na@@ wa@@ at sheds light on how pres@@ idential plans look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which journalists are entitled to protect their sources .
in spite of this , he appeared as a witness in the district court in Tunis on May 09 .
does China want to force users of social media to present their ID ?
according to new regulations of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts suspect that this will prevent the elimination of anonymous comment@@ aries in conversations within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to en@@ force these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of information prolifer@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organise the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these web pages currently include websites such as V@@ kontakte and Od@@ no@@ d@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ R@@ u and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ruled the ban of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia IT administrators refused to delete two articles in English , the indications that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site was closed because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to fom@@ ent a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website , with it , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff
after this week &apos;s le@@ aked documents , Britain &apos;s government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install virus programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civil populations on the outside .
despite all this , the consultation still runs until May 19 . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
