<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the age of 14 I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless journalist who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the supreme court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I thought it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US only strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very fanatiful letter of love written about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds behind the mountain in his opinion, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted for him in multitudes.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the Party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that receives people from all over the world, a deeply devout person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung also did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Brandey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot during my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump broke his way to the nominised Republican presidential candidate, it offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly whites, the presidency sent a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The argument with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook those things, broke my heart almost.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-electors as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those acting in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (note of the OB.): as much as "white against all other ethnic groups," white and whiplash word play, which means "blunt trauma" as the great Van Jones described, has killed exactly what America has done so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its President, twice the son of a Kenyan man whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else would be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd was roaring.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices got louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, that's not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son was pleased sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trumps Land now, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From misery to stars: these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rubbish</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>
<seg id="68">Image of Flickr-User OEA-OAS (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0).</seg>
<seg id="69">What did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero Community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan town Cateura have in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby preolumbine ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the poverty that surrounds them.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gang violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a casual meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the whistle you learn day for day trumpets, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located practically on top of the biggest landfill site of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments under Favio Chávez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all produced from the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article published by the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of remanufactured material and which The Recycled Orchestra calls itself.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary named "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic will follow the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">Back then in West Africa it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law breaker of this type on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at the time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it had not succeeded in catching fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million in Liberia because of looting the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which prevents criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and help each other where illegal fishing is concerned," "" "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can damage the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snail stamp, with information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for authorities to identify ships fishing in prohibited areas - such as those who suggest that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license, where they were on the move, and eventually also whether they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information. what does that mean that ships cannot sell their cargo? and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "this is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, head director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultancy company that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front line</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue that the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year because of the illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include sailing under false flag, fake license titles, indicating fantasy names, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non seamless control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You cannot run my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered vessels that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "said Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It is building a system that will help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, helps detect the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and provides technical support with FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">For example, some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information. it aims at helping FISH-i to find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organization, SkyTruth has recently opened the Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that provides satellite data to display the position of each single trackable vessel worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "meeting with neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also discourage them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships who had previously been fishing without a license and had little to reckon with consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now account for a 33% increase in fishery sales since fishing boats are buying more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets on board where they were prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "Kiilu says." "" "we are a study object." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined together to form the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i.. "security is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," said Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under false flag, was not only on the road without a license and used towing nets that are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "by taking measures against Greek1, they set a strong sign that they act against illegal fishing," "" "said Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a unique collaborative working method to protect the oceans is actually working across the world ocean. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>
<seg id="152">Their articles appear in the Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and the Guardian. situation in Venezuela continues to escalate: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of "recapturing the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This photo by María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on the National Revival, Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into emptiness by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (roughly: Venezuela's regulator) you can find pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being held in other parts of the country, including the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions Mérida and Táchira, in the centrally-north district of Carabobo and Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate, which manifests itself in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the removal of the current president Nicolás Maduro the chance for a fundamental change; in the end, however, the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the governmental decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine insists, the referendum was considered as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to establish a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The election alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (roughly: round table of Democratic unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, called for a majority of representatives from the opposition after the 2015 elections, and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government, should continue to block the referendum on the removal of the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday national civil war and on 3 November all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="171">The images of the marches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming involvement of the people in numerous areas of the country, but also confrontations with policemen and government proponents.</seg>
<seg id="172">"" "one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstrator calling through the shields:" "" "will you kill me because I am hungry?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="173">"" "" "" "will you kill me because I am hungry?" "" "cries this Venezuelan." ""</seg>

<seg id="175">On to Miraflores today. # Amiracle Floreshoy # LaTomaDesVenezuela pic.twitter.com / k8LlZwrp4D</seg>
<seg id="176">On Twitter, pictures that talk about confrontations, as well as reports of oppression and abuse are piling up.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the central-north of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">The demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andenstaat Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts, because otherwise one could see something that many National Guards do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile an infographic shows the amount of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an appeal procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs about this:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado state that 1% of the signatures are counterfeit.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your removal!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the road!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others see these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which, from its point of view, has taken little against the disastrous economic crisis and rather has been preoccupied with putting critical voices into silence:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The marches are increasing in intensity and frequency.</seg>
<seg id="192">Some Venezuelans reported that they were too hungry to take part in a strike rather than work or go shopping.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult, Quijano now testified against his father in the large La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigated crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was alright.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 at La Perla prison from 1976 to 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who, over the years, recognized the scale of atrocities which he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the Sports Hall to the Military Support Centre</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there, I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Kyoto Protocol, customers of a newly opened centre where one can prolong his driver's license, witnessed a particularly unsuccessful translation during the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign, the Japanese word was the Japanese word. (korakisha), which means "older motorists," falsely - perhaps also with malicious hulls & # 8212; translated as "terrible motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has often been shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which is published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it be translated into English?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "Holmes said." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The bad English translation was initially removed. the term "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the appropriate drivers "drivers drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto prefecture paid apologize for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the excuses:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that older people felt insulted by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>

<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awful" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country are quite grounds for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005, representing a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors generated 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and to speak active language skills in order to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which could translate into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who themselves do not have foreign employees, can still make translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose knowledge of English is considered the best, is made to translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The encapsulated and enigmatic movements resulting from mechanical translations show that this technique cannot be replaced by any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints, often adorned with t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless to jewellery. but from big companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more diligent translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the Kyoto city will hopefully use a more reputable source of its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Naval con libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Other users later wrote that the internet presence of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels also featured footage of the protests in Caracas, organised by oppositional groups that oppose Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and delegated the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the link was tied up and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: enable your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites are re-locked by Venezuelan providers.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the web page of @ VivoMenu Net.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time the Commission for Telecommunications threatened to punish them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw it as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I signed up again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEIT infiltrated later that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly delegates its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS server will respond erratically to certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server will respond erratically or refuse the request by calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNA lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was stopped on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes Venezuelans access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a Crimean child as a child. she is now visiting the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today, Tina fights for the rights of children and collects testimonies of other Crimean ta who have become victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report by Global Voices, published by Global Voices, with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen," which is edited and republished by Global Voices in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly said about her. "she's like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one that has become something" "", "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as a Crimean for the family. as Crimean, in Paraguay there are more than 46.000 girls and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money hands over their underage son or their underage daughter to another, wealthier family. in exchange, the child receives food, an education and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children will have to pay a number of days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be done - and all that in the context of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widely used in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crimean ta - especially young girls affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witness testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, as the feeling of gratitude inoculated to the Crimean is generally silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double delusion," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the belief that they conclude their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves," is handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that takes the girl with herself and justifies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hid in Paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín entered the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent strikes. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military personnel Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Resident Registration Office.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira beat on Marín as long as she suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They referred to Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"" "" "" "in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," "" "said Tina Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="449">Without official documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children without impunity.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a speedy investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criminta.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be a landmark case - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">Everyday life of a Crimean</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimean tas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the farbik, in which her father worked, had to enrol for bankruptcy, and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as a Crimean in the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In her employer's house, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and infected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school ended, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but she didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to take more books from the house's library than food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Pardo Liberal, a liberal party which belonged to the Opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings the host of Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read editorials from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he thought she was intelligent, but did not behave with her." "" "the host had found someone listening to while talking about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would learn" bad habits "again there." this meant that Alvarenga, which belongs to the indigenous group of Guaraní, would return home to their mother tongue Guaraní.</seg>
<seg id="473">They feared that they would lose the education they had made for it, they explained.</seg>
<seg id="474">She was completely clear, however, that she paid for everything she got from them, with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never spoken about is bullying and harassment exposed to Crimean ta when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realise that someone who has no parents is a Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="477">I was not able to invite anyone home to me. I had no circle of friends in the school or in the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships were made, I noticed especially clearly that I belonged to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for a permit or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring it to a court process.</seg>

<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament's legislature and the constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control will be maximized and ensure that no deviating narration is present on the screen, "says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the Non-Governmental Organization "Nature Iraq" are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the greater family of leopards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and thriving of the ecosystem also depends on the existence of a big carnivore." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video states that they have a picture of a big cat in the Cameroon, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza is passionately fond of a different side of her country, which is not only made up of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to ensuring that protected areas for wildlife in the Kurdistan region are established.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by tsunami on 11 March 2011 and the region is still occupied with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the Dutch daily Kahoku Shimpo documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "Three Times Catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a number of prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring counties Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had left whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Prefecture of Fukushima was still experiencing an atomic accident, and that's why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of the people concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned sparrows were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of shelter lodgings (for the sake of casetsu juutaku) can be relocated to final parts of the car.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees survived after the disaster in shelters were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1,074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened their doors again by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishery hulls in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishery harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident have affected agrarian land extensively in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 per cent of the land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent of destroyed farmland can be used again in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land are located in Fukushima, located in the "nuclear shut-off zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but again Fukushima is still lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal dwellers have found it more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain an overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her empathy has changed vis-à-vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that there is still not enough in cases of disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, disaster-caused, atomic accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Out of 160,000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63,000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been relocated to permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 state, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuees still live in homes, older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="582">The world is small: our podcast "Into the Deep"</seg>
<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries speaking another language, the differences seem to be larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that one more unites than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives, and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to someone above language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love of music overcame the lack of shared language skills during a journey in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="594">Right: Mateus Ferreira da Silva in a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer had beaten him during a demonstration in Goiânia with a stick against the head. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him on Saturday and have now moved him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local sculpjournalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">The pictures also show the face of the police officer attacking a stick. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Goiás that Sampaio was suspended from active service until the incident of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he strikes in Goiana with his stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer would be beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on TV for six months and all the repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desolalizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiana, informed the video taken by Luiz da Luz, in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics shortly rush to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video filmed with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus starting from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus who lives in another state, Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilian relays (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiana while he is hospitalized.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be brave, Mateus.</seg>
<seg id="609">Against police violence. "</seg>
<seg id="610">The drawing has been shared multiple times in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="611">By: Heitor Vilela. publication with permission.</seg>
<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish has been murdered by his father, because he has undergone the Occupy movement in secondary schools, and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a policeman who struck him with a stick in his face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police transgressions of the police</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil, in which it came to violent police forces against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers deployed rubber bullets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where protesters built a stage for speakers.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peaceful Party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have disguised street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo were specifically informed about a broken glass window to illustratively shape their front pages with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">O Global, on the other hand, O Global preferred a cover story with a brand-set bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if you are strictly against any form of damage to property.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too the term "vandalism" gets an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical acts of violence by the military police are obscured by headlines with the title "protesters on the confrontation course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The Forgotten Villages Forgotten in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba joined the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The folk community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It has been two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After that, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory continued to lose its plants until only the steel and concrete smells remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who is rising every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive period are in operation again because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church looked already better.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were outdated and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the UN agricultural and food organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately $85 million for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will go into history" "", "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane plants, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeated the most is" "" "scam." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially recorded documents that would differ only with respect to the parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was convicted and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he affirmed.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industry in Cuba and the most important workplace producer was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives for the jobs and services provided by the facilities in the communities in which they were located were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammoth-Speech of 21 October 2002, the then president looked into the eyes of the present people when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the people of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or rather, when they began to discredit it, they also ceased to aspire to the road, and this also disadvantaged other businesses.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to seek other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were replaced with spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a future perspective many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">A food factory was created in the area, whose production serves not even for the supply of the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new facility are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene returned to the Boris Luis Santa Coloma plant, the ruins of the place where he began working.</seg>
<seg id="682">Forty-nine harvests bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand Peso a month to spend the years in retirement in Mañalich.</seg>
<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man of black skin, small, with a few teeth and clear voice, is not a retractable person, yet he does not forgive the lies he told him.</seg>
<seg id="684">They have tortured him for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="685">Nene goes to retire at age 65, not because he lacks strength, but because he is embittered.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording of a song by "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">The young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do it through hip-hop thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thereby increases that the young participants discuss topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school "Na Asa Gyilak'Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia says, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called" Highway to tears, "a street section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen usually indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to mediate how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs have been published in indigenous languages, although the young people don't always know the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whenmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop-Group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available, as is a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to keep my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the Day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">Thus they can grow and also go forward to our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what the Creator determined for.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary part, the reader and proponent of Cree language Kevin Brousseau also contributes and adds the verse to syllabus (which is also published on his blog and is republished here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, plastic courts can be seen in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is right on the menu, near the entrance is shokuhin sanpuru (some of the "plastic models of the dishes") are displayed by any food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the toboggan area of Kappabashi, there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic courts are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend will change them today in showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile ribbons decorated with plastic courts as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some shoddly fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and cell phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say," "" "Wow, cool, now can I decorate my phone with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'm going to be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handyons made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">More quirky plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow the Twitter hashtag # for the more.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how the Japanese plastic courts are actually made.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missists and those who were killed regularly appear in stats. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle carries.</seg>
<seg id="750">Reporting about drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely repressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body find behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking") that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who came into the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only let us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video titled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fear changes life" "" ") tells these stories exactly." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a sire looking for secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews, in just one day.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and the leadership of the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensation journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I pass newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is as if they are ridiculing those who have lost someone and those who are scared that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified by the fact that they were "soggy."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they do not stir and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. of Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family has been plundered with threats." it describes how armed criminals blackmailed money from their business for month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of all that you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, the trauma is left, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also changed.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her account with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked me if tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about her.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his infancy ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had passed two years earlier when he was just a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody body of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence by organised crime and the fight against it mingled with the existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Public Security Council and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office counted 3103 Morde. this equates to 8.5 assassination per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNING: this article and the pages to which he links contain pictures on which violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting up a rumor or exposing falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or false, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and ravaged it. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes which were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Official representatives described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby, full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to be unrecognisable.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture with the title" "" "That is Nigeria." "" "from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Multiple photos of the incident reflect the horrible scenes of that day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies lined up on the ground while persons look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo has been taken up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters from the Boko Haram attacked Baga and Doro Gowon in the remote areas of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses have reported a lot of atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpses lay in roads and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which between 150 and 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The following time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the Nigerias military and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One more step further, personal comments such as this example falsely affect the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash report published by the United Nations, those who could flee could strike, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following appeared that brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news page, falsely claiming to be the president of Myanmar's Thein Sein, monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was last accessed on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations called AFP as their source had falsely attributed to Thein His statement, but had not related the image of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The global reach of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false links extend back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">"" "using an" "" "reverse picture search" "" "you can see how far information can cross borders." ""</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverse picture search with the search engine Tinu has found 344 pictures below 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the mentioned picture from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They originate from a mixed mash of private parties, platforms of social media and common as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have redirected false reports, some have attempted to expose the falsifications.</seg>

<seg id="905">This adjustment, which was published exclusively in English, also contains references to fake images of scaffolding molecules used by Hate Speech and used by extremist groups to suggest that Muslims kill Buddhists and vice versa (which is often spread by the Burmese nationalists).</seg>
<seg id="906">Russia, 2012. "a fattening with a book?" (Christianophobia or political provocation?).</seg>
<seg id="907">This post, which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox community, clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians.</seg>
<seg id="908">Saudi Arabia, 2012 / 2014.</seg>
<seg id="909">This news page falsely claimed that the president of Myanmar Thein had admitted to 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the now deleted, Catholic nearby news page Análisis Digital, has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the killings, but it claims that there is a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture later came into circulation in connection with the massacre of Boko Haram from 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorDünyaUyuy" (Nigeria is burning, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo showed up with this Twitterhashtag and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve greater attention to these events which presumably took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The image was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and rescued more than 9,300 times), but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage vis-à-vis Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message which was allegedly written by a "Fr. Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this in Vietnamese and declared it a hoax.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the embassy in which the picture was taken from the DR Congo, the organisation of the Clarettin missionaries and Fr. Juan Carlos Martos stood afar off.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are more confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">Tinu also points out to other accounts, aggregators and pages in the following countries (on the map in Gray), but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Webcrawler and some of them have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010, the picture may ultimately have a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regard to greater discussions on the silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing is used to discuss how African life is underrated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share in drinking water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood suggest false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and embellish the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent pictures has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images may sensitize readers and audience and take the ability to empathise empathy (for example, this study, which investigated how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be derived from the context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, every study of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog called untranslatable (e.g. irreplaceable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unsurpassable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese breeders) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Sobota).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly trying a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Vanuatu Mwictime language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- weary around your parents in recognition of how you have tried around you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or laziness you feel after you have been warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They infiltrate other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this page to publish even more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages," which are highly appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite itineraries here.</seg>

<seg id="972">According to a statement by the Sri Lankan disaster response from 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missed because of floods and sludge waves.</seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and around 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe places of residence.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls ceased on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas were slowly returning.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">High water in Tawana town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users such as Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates to the flood situation.</seg>

<seg id="980">Today morning the Neluwa bus was in high water, water level up to 6 meters. village Moragoda near Galle also flooded due to the water pegels of the Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five airplanes for rescue operations, and another five will be completed for the transport of emergency supplies to the inhabitants enrolled in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages like Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information about flood and humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id="984">If any search and rescue teams require drones for their operations, please call 0774844639.</seg>
<seg id="985">For all who want to donate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -</seg>

<seg id="987">Please call 0777449729 or 0777843841 if you need help in this field.</seg>
<seg id="988">The taxi-call app "PickMe" (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their location data with the app so that the cadastopic centre is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Roanu, Pickups introduced a "flood relief" button that allowed users to call a vehicle for assistance and donations. these were then transmitted free of charge to the Sri Lankan Red Cross.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also included a "SOS" button, which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flooding and landslides.</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already managed this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People I have been working with or who have known me for years separate me - the Sahar who know it - from the widespread concept of "Muslims" that has built up in its imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They are mitigating me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all put in the same Muslim pigeonhole.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims who do not fit in there are mitigated.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Must be mitigated</seg>
<seg id="1011">I'm not alone with it.</seg>

<seg id="1017">Islam, the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western conception, Rumi's religion was deleted, as well as the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deletion makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and forced Saudi, Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body, these are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer-Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has taken our collective imagination so deep and flawed that often Sikh seniors and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where yet Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars will be waged and people have been dealt with by creating the "others" in public performance four decades ago was a scientist of Stanford himself.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and unaware of the "other"; just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we had not presided over the chocolate cake as he already bombarded broken lands and "other made" people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It starts here with all of us.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the multitude of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, there is the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the feasibility of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" listening "" "" is often linked to understanding "" "" these events instead "" "" listen to "" "" to appreciate, to make sense. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers put their story first in their own language and then translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and representation mean that the audience becomes aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the Dafing language. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also took the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells us the fable of the rabbit and the baboon in Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were alert...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to extend it. all inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which rose to USD 72 million, several religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017; the march began with the South African Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (citizens front for the neuralexams of debts) and the ecumenical church assembly in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the reestablishment of debts have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians, bankers and government officials responsible for debts are held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debts, with a fixed remuneration, which is appropriate to our working conditions, which acts in favour of the economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico are refusing to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile themselves with sinking pension payments.</seg>

<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Center for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation with a focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on government responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state's infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and family members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin, there was an event of the # FreeBSel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publishing house published by so-called 'Book Sprints' within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year, and is available free of charge, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartoum, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison where he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives to his friends and his family a voice that pushes him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as an insider of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel founded, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more predictive than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroad of many civilizations and here Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know at that time that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out the architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This journey into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I'm overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other detainees how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a probiodiary she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the protests in 2011 against Bashar al-Assad's regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those arrested or forced to use force by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in detention since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: Director sentenced to previous post due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique responded by anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">He was arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison, together with four other defendants (around 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public money from Mozambique's airports, whose council was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for its re-adjustment to the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which submitted the application, there would be no hindrance for Cambaza to resume his old post as the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people don't approve the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to put the director back in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with respect to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary proceedings against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "wary" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent person, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, a young Mozambican and a student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no moral code:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted it. I can't believe that you reward someone who has so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing morals to return and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man, who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeút prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves are in prison Samah Machel will not only be remembered as the first independent President, but also as a sharp, one-edder and - by the way - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral presentations was, when he firmly confirmed that "an ambitious human being is capable of anything, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the familiar social network accepted their posts from the web because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still being discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin, or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censuses the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or the very last (in Burma) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciatory connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts in order to use the word have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings which have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebathlete Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post by one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty manner if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a play of words.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical, before it deletes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook doesn't delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words on the opposite side.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech have received a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curtail their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who propagate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternate spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post "didn't correspond to the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a multitude of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Khan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems as though they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as "chair" or "sensencurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they discovered that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only had a bit more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun via Facebook and consciously do not write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate language, but were removed anyway:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is meant to heat up violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where clashes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for his failure to control the proliferating hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked more current, more focused on context than initiatives focusing on code and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was adopted against the children's hee - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent, who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Turkish users can see Wikipedia content again by mirroring web pages</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright Act in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular Wikipedia-based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day, it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technologically experienced Internet users are used to using editing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world's third largest VPN prevalence), most common Wikipedia entries do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) as the platform put down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its dedicated peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer-computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is however irrevocable despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we've heard the news (about the blockage from Wikipedia), we all decided to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPC platform. so there is the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently from the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors, if in their respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server redirects the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A black rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps him:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was at home straightaway when suddenly I called Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that a leopard on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kindle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know, for he was already facing tigers face to face face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not disturb himself from the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the King of Budek appeared. he sits down immediately, we look at him and he stares me through the scarf trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for conservation) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to shoot at the Bardia National Park shots of Otters. up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with the utmost care avoid speaking the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a bogus court and violated her family and village community after she had addressed a married couple with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of owning their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of discussion in the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the Campaign # KhelBadal which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and is committed to dismantling the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paste has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera in the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage and the bannishing of HIV and AIDS infected, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion was about women who didn't call their husbands on their names.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands loudly is a custom they have committed and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that up to this discussion, we have never thought about it.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion club with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pacht from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was hiding in front of her throughout the exercise; another decided to let out the whole frustration against him and his family by curse him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the rush of adrenaline, having broken with an age-old tradition, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands on their names at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Over the next few days Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A woman's husband was less understanding and the situation artete into violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the vermilion dot on the forehead that indicates the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "I said to my husband that I would carry the" "" "zinnoberred dot" "" "if he did it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely left with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I've been working on these problems for so many years and yet I've never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they happen to one.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most this is okay, but some wanted to wear a salted-curta, a wide shirt over trousers; they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morality combined with the saris and much more, Rohini gave her own couple of curtas (Obershirts) into a discussion forum, so the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to take a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini are sure they will be able to do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it for a couple of times, but then they stopped saying the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women wear Zinnoberrot at any time on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like violets for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently, they confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">It gives the local superstition that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia claimed the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the aim of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN 2016 mission in the South African country to carry out a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the assassination took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Husky Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The prosecution and murder of bald-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morbibala, Province of Zambézia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power that generate wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook Angela Ferreira Samantha told the chronicle of the Bloggers poor Snaippa, indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCTE GERMAN GERMAN GERMAN, THE SME is ashamed of a country where people would have shame to go to the streets, and others would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread, a land where neither the albinos nor bald or bald-headed for superstitious purposes or "black magic" would be hunted, which aim to get material wealth.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong's Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo drew attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangering) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred Liu case as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and a spokesman said he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China is still receiving calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict handling of the pair in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China, as exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">The European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Liu as she announced in a statement on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced AFP news agency on 27 June that the message urged the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also to liberate his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US Embassy calls for an angry response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and to make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley informed that China should offer to the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system, as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared at the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Earlier diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the Reuters news agency that China had big concerns whether the vortex of Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression and freedom of expression for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and the world</seg>
<seg id="1669">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France called on China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually record it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Obits in Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Land Affairs in Taiwan challenged China on 27 June to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature, Yu-Mei-nu, of the ruling Democratic Progress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned with Liu in a statement on June 28 and stated that many asked him to pray for Liu well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog" "" "Cavalierio" "" "accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it seemed like an attempt to escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very noble: he advocated an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in the face of this, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers, who pretend to be democrats, abandoned the twisted logic, as it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shanmugam offered answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised the corresponding questions with non-replies of a rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng demands Shanmugam to make clear his mind as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear this point, provided that he was paid high to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the whole transcript of the conference so that the context of the statements of Shanmugam could be better understood, according to Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the caption.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was more of a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unimportant even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities witnessed a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said Singapore was" "" "no country," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, making such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard that was waiting for me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that, is properly associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review disassembles the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr Shanmugam committed" "" "good faith a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are considered to be an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it's equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they defend only their town but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must our Prime Minister pay bills?</seg>

<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series is from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1745">"Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice hockey, Nature." many Canadians may cook inwardly against anger when they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - in front of Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1758">Canada allegedly is also considered to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First of all, I have many American friends, whom I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">I wouldn't mind if you would confuse me, for example, with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: being called "nice" means to be spit - like the benign, soft but logically insignificant figure Ned Flanders out of "Die Simpsons" (who has his own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can push yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1771">To be harmless is to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">It can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk about the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open friendliness that I am now connecting with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop band parofrees Thailand's junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, released a music video that parodies the junta, which took power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man talking about what prescriptions his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.254 times shared and received 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army an absolute decision-making authority over important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the infamous program of the "adjustment change" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons who are viewed by the junta as a critic.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army which oversees online content and prosecutes individuals who are accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets a strict stance against "Read Majeste" (majesty compensation).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014 war law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video even shows how persons are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison because they are supposed to have caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the teaser of the song showed members of the band, who imitated the Salut from "The tribute of Panem," which was already used by Putsch opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society only recovered very slowly in East-Abkhazia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">It has now been over 20 years since the Georgian-Abchashic war has officially ended, but its scars are still highly visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the Abkhazia bins.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups, such as Russians, Greeks, Southeast Asia, Georgians and Armenians, lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians and chases live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of the migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold colored earring in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"" "sometimes, says Ms Ramírez, people come in full mini buses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying:" "" "Mama Africa!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramirez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medication they cannot pay, she massaging them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a stache sideburns) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Africans often travel together and that the Africans are already talking about Ms. Ramírez's Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his trip to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests are often sending text messages when they have gone to greet them or report on their journey over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city is a blind alley to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants to their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have seen what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and a Unknown, a single-educator, offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step should take.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, passengers are quietly navigating their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she scapes in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair weaving, she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she puts it briefly before me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya is fueron," she repeats every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities area in western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi got a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app will" "" "prevent access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities could use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after installing the app, exchanged messages with a private wochat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police informed that the app would investigate and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwanking's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is often gloomy for those who live in distant, repressed ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often set extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet, "Images from mainland China," published on Twitter, published censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint in which policemen tested the inhabitants randomly to see if they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiang make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, you may be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced the people to use appliances intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China," also published a Jingwang product description, which shows that the software can raise the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang will become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and affiliated facilities, including universities and research institutions, are required to follow the instructions of cyber security office during the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Freedom House's current report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued a decree to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police until August 1.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." this action, however, violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photograph was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; at times he hurts to his screen, to his computer, back and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as felaheyees (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib is a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questions their tried-and-true opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are relevant not only in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to the whole of Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his thinking, and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he hates a special aversion against U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Taken by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee of the second generation." so he describes himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own circumstances," Hdaib emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while he poured in water soluble Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching jundays has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the gnat of lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - like drinking water in the public during Ramadan - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">The Ministry of the Interior of Jordan recently canceled an appearance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contravenes the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert-cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition, Dima Tahboub, said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" was cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the tried and true legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila cherished the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continued to choose "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflect an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib moved traditional gender norms to bodies by depicting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the skeleton of an apparently striped unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years the number of "honour morals" has increased in Jordan - unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour morals reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan has no institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime prevention from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in jail for an indefinite period of time," and for their release there is often a need for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the family's guarantee that the woman will not do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music also enjoys great popularity and is well-known for not to shy away from themes that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political but admits that he cannot divorce his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics has been tricked in me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "", "and in" "" "Ghiseb," "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it too." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that commentaries on gender equality have still been strongly censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to later remark that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a revised version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly advocates for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nua, a poet of the eighth century, still remembering today, thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwas, who was later to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why cannot Jordanians do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, such as Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">More recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former government representatives and members of the teacher association, stating that on social media commentaries they have expressed critically about the problems associated with the deeply rooted corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now fought Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that's how it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and inner changes.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, like millions of other Arabs, Hdaib dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and on an artificial way of craving democracies.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until that time, Hdaib will rap and consequently resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many parts of Tohoku. another theory states that the arrests, the drums and dancing have been handed over over a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan have marched to the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissant, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebula Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # Nebuafestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outward appearance and body care rarely were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate occupation such as the hairdressers.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high rate of crime, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the unusual styles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most eccentric looks on how to watch in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive education in the barber art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of its achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only vocational school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letters of love to guerilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the revised version of the article" "" "Love Messenger of guerilla fighters" "", "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important to meet people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the young Columbian activist Leonardo Párraga from the Bogota Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the Carta por la Culiación campaign (letters for reconciliation) encouraging young people to write letters to guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">It was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">In front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of genuine reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, subjected to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock, now have to reintegrate themselves into civilian life.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in perpetual fear, and in some cases deep hatred of guerilla fighters, must now commence it in its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: so far, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the atonement was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He continued to say that this year he shared his love with people needing the most pressing response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters who now find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo, traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members stood up as they previously had done to counteract the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in-between," said the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter took me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerilla fighters live) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL Pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, and tired of being the faithful companion of this warrior, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else of life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some of the FARC leaders came together for a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war, and the ARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">For this reason, the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, its ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice was exerting on the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can contribute to making society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I had often seen and hate as monsters, even people with beautiful emotions that were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country is living hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people, including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former combatants responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp commandant in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darfur de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would prevail after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now focusing on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call upon all the defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milasina in the Nowaya Gazeta, throwing a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>

<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name at his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked to send me back to Chechnya to prove that this was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They made absurd demands: some told me that I must prove it by running through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grozny and say that I didn't change my sex that all was only flailing, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what should I have said on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has humiliated not only your family but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 was placed under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't grasp how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering myself, without any evidence, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "in the moment when I wanted to call my mother using WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't think you're in security just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you plug. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to avoid injuring her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I am actually trying to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have remained dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has been in gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not exclude a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being captured in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to settle for Kadyrov's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated in gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports about this yet. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've been wearing my hair forever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in Grozny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to bring us closer to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed lashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia has never touched me even one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Khardah Kharda. that is," "" "Don't be about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">One often says it to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"" "" "" "OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never chased, and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this Gnadenszeit hold?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov stepped onto the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could sense how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had previously laughed and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly worsening.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I'm still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not spend a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people by myself when I clapped aside places of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidroab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That's exactly the same as Chechens who want to fool you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no boils with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanians have which, the cabarins, which the Russians have also which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know many think about transiindifference to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences. but this is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of feeling, to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in suicides within the impoverished Arab communities in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahmad region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a sharp increase in suicide since the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 retreated the desperate situation of the Arab Ahmad community in Iran characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahvz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family to arise, so Ahmad-human rights groups who wish to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared to YouTube held the moments after he had burned himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it quick to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahmad.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahmad Minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahtizi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Manifesto, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families on account of their persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahvazi suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where most of Iran's indigenous Arab communities live in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran as well as some of the richest and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime is systematically denying the Ahtizi Arabs to systematically create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territory, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by drought in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawks grew to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Co-operation, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and 45% had a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Doshii, an Iranian-based human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahmad men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians coming up in Ahraz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahvazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aiming to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside their home of Ahmad.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affiliation with the Ahmad and be hired, since even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahmad people have to endure, human rights activists oppose the alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zurich.This article was originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even show well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education women still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict supervision when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex passes through the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold underneath.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to talk on skin color, on racism, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the diaspora; if I mention how we have been abused physically, emotionally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decided to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and" sing "Kumbaya, my Lord," to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to say that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all people of all skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her thinking, which relate both to sex and to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white-feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech: "am I not a woman?" and even I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a degraded and marginalized creature in historical terms.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also by cultural appropriation absorb our customs and customs to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them to a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and isolate themselves from white feminism there is still the word "feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of the Womanism that has been created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than applying for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womans: recolaiming (such as: Africa-Womanism: how we recapture ourselves) speaks about how we can defend ourselves by defining our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they can be completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life has neither passed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by curative. the article belongs to the series # PorSermujer (# consecuefrubin), who reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most of the names were changed for the protection of the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent to her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be laid to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman Balbuena showed due to maltreatment, Ada Báez's knowledgeable display did nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women pay any complaint at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women, admit to be victims of violence, must contact the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content1 blows and statistic 2 unseen mistreatment and a legal system that does nothing undernimmt3 Paraguay laws: good approach, poor implementation hits and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centre de Documentación y Estudio, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports, which do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 the District Attorney's Office opened 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of it was violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of the ads of women came here as well.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women minister, Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed. "on any woman who will be refunded in Paraguay because of mental abuse, 9 women who do not.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "for every woman who will be refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do so," "" "she stated at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder is not a crime in Paraguay, law enforcement agencies cannot properly document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but after that she had to repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that that only happened to women who are too submissive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse caused by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote contributions on Facebook, in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two years relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their posts, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some of their innocence.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the Paraguay authorities to prove that her former partner abused her.</seg>

<seg id="2519">They do what many others don't do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case, everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>

<seg id="2523">Victoria's adverts at the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>

<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos (# non-deserved) movement are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to explain and harden Feminid as an independent criminal record, as is already the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislative text was changed in a number of ways in order to also attract the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is banned, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill foreseen that the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs, which the victims of violence must carry on themselves, if they simply only reimburse them and would like to receive a secure accommodation, lay down the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethink must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who are silent in the face of these facts are complicit and contribute to the perpetrator being offended.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to refund for such a long time until there is no more maltreatment than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law were changed, among other things a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Chinese authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn because of their reporting on corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he serves a year-old prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri were also arrested and brought to court, but later released again.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after completing his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, he has held the most important positions in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The sultan dominance is characterised by the persistent efforts of security forces, in particular domestic secret services, civil liberties, including freedom of the press, restricting and detecting human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restricts peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and restricts citizens, including activists, to express their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspapers Azamn, their closure and the detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for the freedom of the press in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, in which since its foundation in 2007, corruption was reported in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">Security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, arrested on 28 July 2016, after an article was published in the paper on 26 July 2016 with the title of "High-ranking parties tie the hands of justice." it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high-ranking officials in judicial decisions.</seg>

<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final shutdown of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned, inter alia, for disturbance of public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "undermining of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of breach of publication ban and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three year imprisonment and fines of 3,000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars), and a one-year ban imposed on the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">A security deposit of 5000 omanic Rial (13 000 US dollars) was set for Al-Abri and was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for one year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month prison sentence from the Central Prison in Maskat. al-Haj remains in prison where he serves his one-year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition, the Appeals Court annulled the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the paper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the Court to allow Azamn to resume, the newspaper is still facing attacks by the Brazilian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued a statement to extend the closure of "Azamn" by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and with what the minister once again opposed the decision of the Appeals Court to allow the publication of the newspaper again.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper aren't the only cases in which the press freedom in Oman has recently been violated.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the arrest of journalist Al-Haj, the impression arises that the Chinese authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) is calling on the authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj will release immediately and unconditionally;</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom or even not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have much more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment to research these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Research on Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Sámi health system.</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the National Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) programme with laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, health care (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa against Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it's often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been raging salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outputs Gorgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents applied not only to individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green ton or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or grape varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton is still growing salad, but now he needs longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like a boulder in a river, around which I have to dull." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new kind of salad, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very cautious and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman balsamic of the" "" "glasshouse" "" "of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"" "the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "" "open-source" "" "seed) is inspired by the free" "" "open source" "" "software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software." ""</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, briefly called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who purchase their seeds, cross it to breed so own varieties and not immediately cut it out - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">More gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Executive Board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, the latest examples are the amalgamations of ChemChina and Syngenta and Bayer, as it is offered for example on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables are bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seed is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available to others, as opposed to patenting seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool shrinks unsteadily due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material which is therefore always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all key features are protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders at all or only complicates.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that large-scale crops such as wheat are patented in a larger scale than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those, through which their taste or colour improves to such, because they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "it contradicts the notion that intellectual property claims other breeders as" "" "patents and protection of plant varietals promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not prevent innovations, but it promotes them by providing more material and expertise to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed crops adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a common good and must remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to make farmers their work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will make us impossible if we can't continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "overall, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics:" "" "we do not create the features really themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">They form the plants themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do so.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety also put their own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation requires massive herbicides, is breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets but are smaller than Monsanto) patents, they create the most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I'm experimenting with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves, "he says." with a patent it is protected for 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it very simple in my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seems to be the leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, implements an open source seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional crop plants, the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "the German organization Agrecol works on an" "" "open-source" "" "license, which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding vary from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable, thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">One explanation, however, is not yet a law; it is now in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed patenting.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "the Egyptian authorities are still blocking contents on the internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the Web site of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on that.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true to its goal in defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as it is now. ANHRI has confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blockage and not to yield. we insist on carrying out our mission further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network for alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of wave of web page lockouts fell victim to victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of Columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, was itself the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which also Ziadas blog is given a home, on the other hand is more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while reporting on the student protests and recorded a video on how police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a comment, Ziada commented on the government's locking and reflected what it means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blogging of blogs might not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) I managed to convey the feeling of a state of siege; arrest, attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blogs of blogs as well as any other web site I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They proved that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous are walking their way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked out 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers, by bypassing Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blockage of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice points to the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are being made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis on which it can act against these acts in court." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army in the favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Newspapers report day after day newspapers all over Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "At the second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves rob the pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temier sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air tea to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a strained financial situation, the 2017 violence threshold reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">Thus, the paper published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial "Extra" on August 16, titled "This is not normal," in which she announced a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything that happens in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guards, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a martial law in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 sites controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the paper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise atrocities committed by the police who only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecila Oliveira evokes the violence as a "war." this is, in her opinion, a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to give accountability to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"" "according to the statistics of 2015, Rio de Janeiro as" "" "the most violent place in Brazil" "" "is wrong:" "" "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north-east of the country." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the morats per federal state, Rio is ranked 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition, Globo, the largest media company in South America, has been repeating the security policy of the state for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the federal state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by using a massive police force and to permanently infirm a unit.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, however, this led to a decline of violent deaths. for some years, however, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles in 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not meet the criteria set out by the Geneva Conventions - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls upon the state to use means and means typical of a war. this involves entering into the territory of a "enemy," in which a Zivilist is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police seizes the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the middle of all this violence, this incident made headlines: a fruit sellers died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories in Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace organization PAX and the Research Institute, The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding land, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region, where an attack of chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded life of hundreds of civilians, is particularly affected.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been besieged outside Damascus, which led to the fact that residents are dependent on locally produced or canned food caused by tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">"" "as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid workers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as" "" "life-saving food source" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food-grown food in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to AFP, the French news agency:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we opted for cultivation of mushrooms, because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, you can use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform Cando in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families with the knowledge of planting mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around €12,700, but will continue to raise funds on Cando until Monday 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the fuel shortage, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they started the "production of fungal seeds from the regions," before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people were protesting on 21 October in many capitals in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires between 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week of solidarity with the victims for a period of three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 bursts of fire that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors forest areas by satellite photos, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can take a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees from easily inflammable wood, like in a vicious circle, spread more and more after fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the Civil Protection Web site of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when residents were seeking information or trying to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used the own civil protection data with the help of the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and became so crucial at this fateful weekend in October that the server did not stand up to the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups defeated by the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At the same time, Asharpen Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the Ethnic group of Hazara, was in Ghazni Province in Central Afghanistan for the last time together with his family at dinner.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>

<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," recalled Asharpen in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked as well.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"" "there were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Asharpen had left his life without any official papers in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing over the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected asylum application, Asharer came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, walking alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to help needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relatively high response rates is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights Organisation of Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 "special reception centres." these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unqualified personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission centre, if they have officially submitted a request for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And that's how it was Asharpen.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his uncrowful life-willing helper helped Asharpen free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf put all his savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast meal.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharpen Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans run businesses, including dressmaking, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant oriental Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the peace & amp restaurant in Padua. Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs targets go far beyond the Italian food and retail trade and go back to the country which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Asharpen with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharpen has also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "thus they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharpen has made this journey for himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this journey.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the release of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Share from @ Ciluna27 on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet Rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">"" "" "" "the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registration with a government authority." ""</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register to use social networks within six months of the successful legislative decision on the authority's website stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the removal of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, applied by 60 members of parliament, is currently under the control of the Legislative Committee and the Constitutional Committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">Another MP handed over a legislative proposal in May in which harsher punishments would be introduced for the insult of the president or a high official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the enviroment of the President and the state institutions is already punishable. however, under the legislative proposal, such action would be punished with prison and fines, such as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in prison on a court date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison management, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendant from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatened with the death penalty as a result of one, so many human rights groups agree, headlight from among others weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza reported the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-morsi seating block at the Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists to intercede on leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was largely interrogated to an enchanted action plan. said Plan stems from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would accuse businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all illegally received monies.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21 on the web site of Nawaat sheds light on how presidential plans look for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources, stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which journalists are entitled to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In spite of this, he appeared as a witness in the district court in Tunis on May 09.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to present their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this will prevent the elimination of anonymous commentaries in conversations within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these rules only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the state government as" "" "organiser of information proliferation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organise the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnodki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.Ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees Wikipedias</seg>

<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website, with it, among other things, China, one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain cannot stop to sniff</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week's leaked documents, Britain's government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install virus programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies on the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civil populations on the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation still runs until May 19. reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
