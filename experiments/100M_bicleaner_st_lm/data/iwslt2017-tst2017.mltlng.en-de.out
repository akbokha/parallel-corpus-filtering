this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA have illeg@@ ally listened to phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
he described a disa@@ strous US intelligence operation in which the CIA ab@@ dic@@ ated Iran as literally a blu@@ ep@@ r@@ int for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t like at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been investigating bre@@ aches and urged him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to den@@ ounce whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ a@@ geous they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked on tears , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they were indic@@ ative for years that it would be essential in their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped at Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failure and ris@@ king to make statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , listened to his phone call secretly ,
just as its email dates , financial and banking information , its lending , and even travel notes with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in his accession , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of their job as secret .
since 11 September almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
they can do it from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t yet exist when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , at which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , as shown here by the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer secretly proc@@ ure information , and many of the information it would ask would not be available from the outset .
but Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments all over the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to get mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the nearest environmental worker who warns the alarm of the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ ders who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were sent from News about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it up ? &quot;
we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the very first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of USD 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend from childhood days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next disclosed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns all of us .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are being used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their fortun@@ es -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these gi@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter .
presum@@ ably , because so far there were no prominent Americans who came to this sc@@ andal in these dis@@ closures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have ties to the US .
in fact , in some US states , there is less information needed to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card .
this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed che@@ aters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here in Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
it really shock@@ ed us that all except one lawyer made suggestions for our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no @-@ one was given money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
we have to change the rules to make this type of behavior more difficult .
this may sound very dim as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there were always the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I can quite see that some things have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen incidents of more transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU registers in central registers at national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama expos@@ ures , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bo@@ g@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy who stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and stand up to stop this type of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a sale of the yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I need to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in there ?
a stranger is sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , shr@@ ug@@ ging on toes to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me .
let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate runs out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could make something about it . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and thus created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I stopped .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former fellow @-@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ u czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people can share public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms - the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
through the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were waiting for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you concentrate on the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design achieve something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ire to .
it &apos;s a 30 second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
share your cell phone with your left seat .
this soft touch of panic that you can sense now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that &apos;s more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
so most of the guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ?
could you please tell on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the President &apos;s office ?
you can now return your mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he was coming from , like his dog or his children ?
imagine you have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really grab very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your cell phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system decisi@@ vely strengthens trust .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to disp@@ ense with negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest left their reviews before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence .
not surprisingly , we trust people most who are closest to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation pi@@ er@@ ces simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you give away from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great art works in your home ! I &apos;m going on holiday with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you design it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to take away these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need not covered in advance .
for us , the business is running very well .
of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts already when I think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , of the 123 million overnight stays , only a fraction was ever a problem .
for people trusted one another to be right .
when confidence works , miracles can arise .
one of our guests was on holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his judgment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to be heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life , even though they don &apos;t know one .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want people to feel lonely , they drop books .
you can stay one even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay does not work .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled on this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing fit together with money transactions ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not just the right thing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people are sharing a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visited , a group of residents there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub craw@@ l quarter of which you have never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of shared participation ?
I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces belonging to the government ,
have been offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were given to people whose children were stri@@ pped off . incu@@ b@@ ator programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries alone will be a guest in a foreign or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem as crazy as it has been taught us .
we did not re @-@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why exactly did our work ?
apart from thank@@ fulness and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it ast@@ ounding ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know , of course , that design can &apos;t solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this big impact , I ask myself what we can use in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
this is how the media portra@@ y people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ ef@@ ree fitness fan club ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
no , not a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was that at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and finally believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone is perc@@ ei@@ ving you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should I do something like that ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Middle East ... &quot; &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects .
the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate course .
I remember how I stro@@ de -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings waited : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or of people held for Muslims , broke into the open and beat them .
there were really sur@@ charges on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have war@@ med up the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I don &apos;t have any questions , I love issues .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only maintained under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the US body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic athletes .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not stopping terror .
regular visits to a mos@@ que cause people to consider other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant and show greater public participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington D.@@ C. area recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radic@@ alisation , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the person to believe the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ates their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we have to stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything in order to stop a group like the IS .
but we would fit into their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , such as the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an and Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology strongly in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when you take a look at them , they are not exagger@@ ating what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ erg@@ y@@ man with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to her fur@@ y , she was a main target for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this ima@@ m re @-@ established the connection with God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que saved her from joining the IS .
that was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia is concerned with me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian system of government , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows : when people present messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they would rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
when you see when the mood sw@@ ings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear is har@@ ming all of us .
in the assignment of collective guilt it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young couple , married in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was talented at the Faculty of Dental , promising , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was ast@@ o@@ unded and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has such a young man born of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her as well as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution after he posted comments against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he fired eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child seat we drove in silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , drew my shoes , went to the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment , I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion for pan@@ i@@ cking and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who claim that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with depth , working in a pos@@ h think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say dec@@ eive you . I am perfectly normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
looking at Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest study conducted by Muslims around the world , people want to do normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so in no way am I an exception .
when people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions all over the world .
before the air package penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks in front of the audience . some years ago they started flying with ropes .
by connecting to each other , flight units reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces .
they can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence , and generally respond to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of the possible in autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must coll@@ ectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
every flying machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at highest level , e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern starter ,
a flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most of the Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gl@@ ers it can ho@@ ver , and therefore has great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a reverse side .
a restriction of hed@@ ging is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that no matter in what position the aircraft can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask for basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accum@@ ulate to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote control aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flies worked with only one .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bars , no other actuators or controller surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , inside life a lot happens so that it can fly stable and can move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the sophisticated algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right , if everyone is watching me is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the monster is an exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , is an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it rot@@ ates or even rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive streams from the eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is possible in models , the rest is learned directly while flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- can the machine continue to fly , though limited .
we will now demonstrate this by making half of it f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration studied synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expressions .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the most secure machine over there would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us the wage lies in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
over 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes were cir@@ cling around each other in a very distant gal@@ axy . they transformed the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
this short moment they lit up bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
finally we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was em@@ itted into the space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , just a multi @-@ cell life on Earth emerged .
since then , the Earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago a group of particularly cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravit@@ ational waves caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them considered it crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy genius , so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer gravit@@ ational wave observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which improved the recognition performance tremend@@ ously .
that is why we now call him Advanced Lig@@ o .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the Det@@ ector was commissioned , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes smo@@ ked through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector too .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the good@@ bye from my death @-@ sick father .
basically , these were the fruits of my life .
all of what I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been examining gravit@@ ational waves from black holes for 23 years and their signals meas@@ urable through observ@@ atories as lig@@ o . what are gravit@@ ational waves ?
a gravit@@ ational wave is a cl@@ utter in the fabric of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ out into the other .
in the context of the theory of rel@@ ativity , lec@@ turers often perform a real sil@@ ly dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and spra@@ ying . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ ewed at the meeting of the waves . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1st Therefore , one explained the Lig@@ o workers for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length should be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
gravit@@ ation at the end of his classical text
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous .
but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne has published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical because you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light surrounding you from several points .
with sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a great deal to you :
the face of your child , for example .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; dum@@ b Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies lie in audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott holds himself very long already .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same pen with an additional key change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14th , 2015 -- a date that I will never forget about -- listened to Lig@@ o the following : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ der noise &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to hear , recognizes this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ times solar mass that rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what that means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle each hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we &apos;ve heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe , as never before was possible .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never pass through as these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational waves penetrate the iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , as the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
with the help of gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly , I am optim@@ istic that there are things which we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that cause black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the din@@ osau@@ r bones for our archaeological work so to speak .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of events in space , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and compass of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of big dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago , I experim@@ ented with an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to all I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , in unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : that &apos;s exactly what I was afraid of , eliminating my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected form . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , is called all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smart@@ ly cup &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on I s@@ wore to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I am going , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : first of all , I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; -@@ say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think things out , awaken you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce TV .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , ie all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my series of television series conver@@ ge on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are programs that I created myself , and not just produced , so far above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who else is doing ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just walking around on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it &apos;s like I put troops on when I painted on a canvas .
as if one had a high tone , run a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sum .
there is such a change in me when work is going well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people accept when I explain the tot@@ als to them that I talk about writing that writing is preparing me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s what it does .
but the sum -- when I began to work and work with TV production , when I started working and making , building , creating and working together , I discovered this sum , this sum , this energy .
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , then you cannot asp@@ ire to the size .
the feeling of being no different than striving for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
maybe it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the tot@@ als .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things I am writing , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land which I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high clay , the sum , the sum , the sum .
I like this sum . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , burned out .
the sum stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom@@ my is one single working title .
Har@@ per told people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ us .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum was stopped .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was off .
the sum did not come back .
my bu@@ zz@@ ing was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no tot@@ ality .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was an Show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sum I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lo@@ cu@@ l you , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do , you do , you love what you do , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and this gives you the sum if you know the tot@@ als when you stop the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late in it and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my sums are smo@@ thered , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play with her sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum , I cannot do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high clay - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax p@@ ens and the song in which it comes to letting go , or whatever the girl lets loose in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ solves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the sum is slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but there &apos;s there .
not the sum , but a sum .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum , the sum of work , the titanium dioxide , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using programs and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real money is .
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real money is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current that comes from the z@@ est of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I make this a fixed rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not enough to me as I work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person works better than being at home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I must have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is not one of them .
we gr@@ ate around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I mostly feel stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever left playing ?
you can do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you consider me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it as well !
you have time !
and do you also know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit consumed me .
and when my teen@@ age daughter speaks with me for a whole 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more need not be required .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even on a bad day !
15 minutes at a time !
no mobile phone , no washing , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner that children make ready .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for their peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I &apos;m dry . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training , when I wanted to out@@ perform myself more and more .
15 minutes on the track , why not indul@@ ge in full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz then seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy po@@ urs in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the sum of life .
the sum of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s clear to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan playing a journey to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the country that I create , the marathon which I run , the troops , the screens , the high tone , the sums , the sum , the other , the right sum : the sum of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , bare and new feeling of being alive in me is wide . less Titan -- I more !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll raise you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
they have certainly heard of one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; thus , one im@@ planted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circu@@ it@@ ry of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that cran@@ ial @-@ brain trauma is causing the brain to grow and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
being able to grow cells from a tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do so .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly spread and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they account for 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear , however -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them with color in order to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step we reim@@ proved them at the removal point of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ plant@@ able these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ reim@@ port the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we reim@@ planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we inserted a violation and they reim@@ ported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the re @-@ reim@@ plant@@ ations .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in the culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
can these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feeding pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we hurt the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex .
after that the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like with the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to the injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we reim@@ proved the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely go .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then it is necessary to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Y@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit with TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant which it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as un@@ changeable d@@ rought .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remain completely un@@ democratic .
democracy is indeed d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ aked friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present an economical model for a real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , China &apos;s Communist Party and even the Euro@@ group succ@@ umb to a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy .
without democracy our societies are mixed , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are wa@@ sted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point to an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the twin @-@ top parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognise his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the high net worth savers and corporations , who , however , are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and generate income with which to carry the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion U.S. dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , railway tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
$ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar amounts to a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion U.S. dollar , which at the same time went around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and boost real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low total economic demand that , like in a continuous loop , reinfor@@ ces the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , as in a continuous loop , could be true that his son would kill him if he grew up ,
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances causing O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
that is my Ha@@ des with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
his extremely la@@ vis@@ h article All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the Earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed up too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive part of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vote wei@@ ghting in matters of the state concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle that g@@ lows very bright , it is quickly burnt out .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a statute for rulers .
for liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- the world of the corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , while the economy gradually sub@@ ver@@ ted politics and em@@ power@@ ing it .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not about degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in government and still not in power , because the power has mig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my dis@@ cord with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals , from which it nour@@ ishes itself , that at the end it star@@ ves .
similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med politics so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism disp@@ els the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must re @-@ assemble the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that working poor should reg@@ ain a position just as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ paid workers through automation and robots .
the problem here is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks become higher , more wast@@ eful , and social conflicts lower , as it will be -- very soon , as I think , in countries like China .
so we have to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the sectors of economy and politics , and take care that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or through something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are serving people and putting people their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the area of the company : imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital will follow you from one job to the next , from one company to another , and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , to whom the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no to@@ wering twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy : please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Gruppe of the 20 largest Emerging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it the Cos@@ mos , in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , in particular , we have them , in particular against the backdrop of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is simultaneously liber@@ ated , in which it pre@@ fers privileged people , and marx@@ ist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
we will awaken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or are we going to sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Luigi Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do so , technological development will produce such a massive reduction in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers described as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by the transmission of this crisis from one part of the earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ se our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also perfect .
BG : in fact , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t sleep , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you keep from the view of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
we have the appearance of democracy in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in some ways , if I dare to say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what we can see now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
now to acc@@ use China of doing what the West did in the 19th century sm@@ ells huge according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good@@ bye to self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continuous den@@ ial that a massive throw line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to mas@@ sively thre@@ aten the development of the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to sustain life through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes take place , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what change do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ous ...
if there is a minister of finance or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims that he made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the side of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been carrying out a disa@@ strous programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
this is worse than during the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika who imposed this policy conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you still seem to be pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the released powers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post@@ modern 1930 according to what it seems to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard the majority , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studio ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an idi@@ ot hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows this rating will receive .
if your show is rated at nine and above , this will be a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after having watched a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to forbi@@ d &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle exc@@ esses , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
it requires guaranteed success , so it holds a competition .
he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV Shows by analy@@ zing eight candidates , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch them for free .
and if Amazon gives out things for nothing , does one intervene , right ?
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
but they don &apos;t know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you jump over and look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it and it results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- a little above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it a little different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com by four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work in everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computer .
the minimum thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work in such a way , then this is a bit frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the Multi @-@ Health System ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in jail .
if someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not discharge takes place .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the most exhaus@@ tive companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it could be predicted by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the aw@@ ful way -- by data analysis of the Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked fine , year by year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was another sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data also stream into decisions of life -- at work , in legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use a lot of data to make serious choices , such as the decision for a cancer therapy .
over the years , I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its components , so that you can analyse the components ; as a branch , put the individual components together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put it together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise would not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their choices , first when competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tell us the dates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is pretty useful .
many of you will ...
before there was any data , this was the device for decision @-@ making .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for making decisions using a Ja@@ une or No question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will fight it later with a technical demonstration .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a bit more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not alter the basic structure .
so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
at the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
