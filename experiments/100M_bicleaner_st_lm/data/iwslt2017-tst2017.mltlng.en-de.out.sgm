<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA have illegally listened to phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">He described a disastrous US intelligence operation in which the CIA abdicated Iran as literally a blueprint for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't like at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been investigating breaches and urged him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to denounce whistleblowers and spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked on tears, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were indicative for years that it would be essential in their case, the government's demands were dropped at Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and risking to make statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his understanding, listened to his phone call secretly,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as its email dates, financial and banking information, its lending, and even travel notes with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers in his accession, but instead, the judiciary condemned more than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of their job as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 11 September almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">They can do it from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that didn't yet exist when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, at which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, as shown here by the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer secretly procure information, and many of the information it would ask would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments all over the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to get misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals. or the nearest environmental worker who warns the alarm of the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insiders who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were sent from News about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of USD 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend from childhood days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next disclosed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are being used by a few to hide and obscure their fortunes -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these giants.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because so far there were no prominent Americans who came to this scandal in these disclosures.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle behind which these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have ties to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states, there is less information needed to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here in Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all except one lawyer made suggestions for our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no-one was given money to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this type of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very dim as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there were always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I can quite see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen incidents of more transparency concerning the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU registers in central registers at national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama exposures, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, are used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy who stand up and say," "" "Intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and stand up to stop this type of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the intransparency which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a sale of the yard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where are you sleeping today?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I need to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get in there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, shrugging on toes to the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate runs out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think about how we could make something about it. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "we created a website and thus created" "" "Air mattresses and breakfast" "" "[AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb]." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stopped.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow-mate, Nate Bleu czyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">We presented ourselves to investors: "we want to create a website where people can share public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms - the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Through the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you concentrate on the things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design achieve something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30 second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Share your cell phone with your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic that you can sense now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that's more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most of the guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell on Twitter that he is channeling for the President's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor first presented himself with his name; if he had told where he was coming from, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really grab very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system decisively strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to dispense with negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest left their reviews before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust people most who are closest to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation pierces similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you give away from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, for example" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "you tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, for example" "" "Great art works in your home! I'm going on holiday with my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you design it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to take away these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need not covered in advance.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than those calls. it hurts already when I think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays, only a fraction was ever a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted one another to be right.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, miracles can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests was on holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to be heart attacks due to sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life, even though they don't know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want people to feel lonely, they drop books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay one even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay does not work.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled on this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing fit together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but to call it simply" "" "rental industry" "" "is not just the right thing." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People are sharing a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visited, a group of residents there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub crawl quarter of which you have never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Have been offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were stripped off. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone 785,000 people in 191 countries alone will be a guest in a foreign or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem as crazy as it has been taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not re-invent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from thankfulness and timing we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it astounding,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design can't solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this big impact, I ask myself what we can use in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashing, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media portray people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carefree fitness fan club,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was that at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, compared to the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to adapt me to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and finally believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone is perceiving you, understands you completely, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>

<seg id="289">"" "I had a child later, after my marriage, and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian-American Dream" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "" "breaking news" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..." "... in the name of Islam..."... "Middle East..." "Jihad..."... "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu, the deeds of others turned me into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day, we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I strode -- as we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," "" "Be vigilant," "" "Be careful," "" "stay in well lit areas," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings waited:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims, or of people held for Muslims, broke into the open and beat them.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really surcharges on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have warmed up the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I don't have any questions, I love issues.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only maintained under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the US body, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces, but not stopping terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visits to a mosque cause people to consider other faiths more tolerant and show greater public participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington D.C. area recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalisation, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group can make a brainwashing that causes the person to believe the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhates their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we have to do everything in order to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would fit into their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, such as the Ku Klux Klan and Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology strongly in their" "" "Holy Book." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">But when you take a look at them, they are not exaggerating what they read in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergyman with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to her fury, she was a main target for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam re-established the connection with God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque saved her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight into how Islamophobia is concerned with me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian system of government, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: when people present messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they would rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you see when the mood swings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear is harming all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective guilt it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young couple, married in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented at the Faculty of Dental, promising, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astounded and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when has such a young man born of my brother?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her as well as the sister of Yusor, Razan who was visiting in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as in a execution after he posted comments against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He fired eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child seat we drove in silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, drew my shoes, went to the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled people were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment, I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion for panicking and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who claim that you're holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with depth, working in a posh think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say deceive you. I am perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as ordinary as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">Looking at Muslims all over the world, and I did that with the largest study conducted by Muslims around the world, people want to do normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So in no way am I an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people appear as an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air package penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre-high tower of 1,500 bricks in front of the audience. some years ago they started flying with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting to each other, flight units reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence, and generally respond to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of the possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every flying machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at highest level, e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called stern starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the Starrflüglers it can hover, and therefore has great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a reverse side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of hedging is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that no matter in what position the aircraft can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask for basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accumulate to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote control aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies worked with only one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and crossbars, no other actuators or controller surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside life a lot happens so that it can fly stable and can move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the sophisticated algorithm of the stern-starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right, if everyone is watching me is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monster is an exercise in contentment, this machine here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, is an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it rotates or even rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive streams from the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is possible in models, the rest is learned directly while flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- can the machine continue to fly, though limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half of it flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expressions.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The most secure machine over there would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the wage lies in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">Over 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes were circling around each other in a very distant galaxy. they transformed the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit up brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was emitted into the space-time frame itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let's arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, just a multi-cell life on Earth emerged.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravitational waves caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them considered it crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy genius, so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometer gravitational wave observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of ligo could be significantly increased, which improved the recognition performance tremendously.</seg>
<seg id="483">That is why we now call him Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the Detector was commissioned, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes smoked through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector too.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All of what I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been examining gravitational waves from black holes for 23 years and their signals measurable through observatories as ligo. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a clutter in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stout into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">In the context of the theory of relativity, lecturers often perform a real silly dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and spraying."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stewed at the meeting of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1st Therefore, one explained the Ligo workers for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length should be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of a atomic nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">Gravitation at the end of his classical text</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne has published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical because you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light surrounding you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a great deal to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child, for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now Alice is talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"dumb Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies lie in audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott holds himself very long already.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same pen with an additional key change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14th, 2015 -- a date that I will never forget about -- listened to Ligo the following: [surrender noise] Somebody who knows what to hear, recognizes this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-times solar mass that rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle each hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to explore the universe, as never before was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space, we can't see -- practically or basically --.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate the iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, as the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly, I am optimistic that there are things which we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that cause black holes, such as Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the dinosaur bones for our archaeological work so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of events in space, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and compass of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I experimented with an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes" "" "to all I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, in unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: that's exactly what I was afraid of, eliminating my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social fear -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected form. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, is called all" "" "kittens" "", "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my" "" "smartly cup" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on I swore to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I am going, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: first of all, I fully understood that the "yes" -say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think things out, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, ie all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts simultaneously: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my series of television series converge on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are programs that I created myself, and not just produced, so far above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work, so that you understand that I'm not just walking around on the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreaming with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I put troops on when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if one had a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the sum.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain the totals to them that I talk about writing that writing is preparing me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that's what it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sum -- when I began to work and work with TV production, when I started working and making, building, creating and working together, I discovered this sum, this sum, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum, then you cannot aspire to the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of being no different than striving for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the totals.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things I am writing, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land which I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high clay, the sum, the sum, the sum.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overloaded, overloaded, overloaded, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mommy is one single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper told people: "my mom won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titus.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sum was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzzing was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no totality.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was an Show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think:" "" "locul you, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do, you do, you love what you do, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and this gives you the sum if you know the totals when you stop the buzz, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late in it and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "kitten." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no one more" "" "kittens" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my sums are smothered, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play with her sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sum, I cannot do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high clay - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax pens and the song in which it comes to letting go, or whatever the girl lets loose in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sum is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but there's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sum, but a sum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sum, the sum of work, the titanium dioxide, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using programs and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real money is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real money is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I make this a fixed rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not enough to me as I work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person works better than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I must have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We grate around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I mostly feel stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever left playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you consider me naïve, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it as well!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit consumed me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And when my teenage daughter speaks with me for a whole 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more need not be required.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even on a bad day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at a time!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no washing, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner that children make ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzz, to have a place for their peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I'm dry. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training, when I wanted to outperform myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track, why not indulge in full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz then seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy pours in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's clear to me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan playing a journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children are.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sum. the country that I create, the marathon which I run, the troops, the screens, the high tone, the sums, the sum, the other, the right sum: the sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, dying, bare and new feeling of being alive in me is wide. less Titan -- I more!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think things out, I'll raise you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have certainly heard of one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." thus, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuitry of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that cranial-brain trauma is causing the brain to grow and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Being able to grow cells from a tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François was able to do so.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly spread and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They account for 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them with color in order to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimproved them at the removal point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplantable these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we re-reimport the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplanted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we inserted a violation and they reimported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the re-reimplantations.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feeding pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we hurt the motor skills range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">After that the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimproved the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely go.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Yocelyne, thank you for your visit with TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant which it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unchangeable drought.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remain completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Democracy is indeed dwindling with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was unmistakably clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my soaked friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present an economical model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, China's Communist Party and even the Eurogroup succumb to a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy our societies are mixed, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the twin-top paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognise his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the high net worth savers and corporations, who, however, are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and generate income with which to carry the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, England and the eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, railway tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3.4 trillion US dollar amounts to a lot of money until one compares it with the $5.1 trillion U.S. dollar, which at the same time went around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to inflate the stock markets and boost real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is staggering wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low total economic demand that, like in a continuous loop, reinforces the pessimism of investors, which, as in a continuous loop, could be true that his son would kill him if he grew up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances causing Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my Hades with Capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely lavish article All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy closed up too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to diminish the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive part of the Athenian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they granted them the right to political co-determination with the same vote weighting in matters of the state concerns.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "the Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long --" ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very bright, it is quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- the world of the corporations -- became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, while the economy gradually subverted politics and empowering it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not about degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in government and still not in power, because the power has migrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my discord with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that sustainably decimated the animals, from which it nourishes itself, that at the end it starves.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has harmed politics so far that it hurts itself through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are depreciated, the macroeconomic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism dispels the "demos" of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must re-assemble the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that working poor should regain a position just as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-paid workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem here is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks become higher, more wasteful, and social conflicts lower, as it will be -- very soon, as I think, in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to redesign the economy and reunite the sectors of economy and politics, and take care that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film "matrix" appear as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or through something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines are serving people and putting people their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athens "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital will follow you from one job to the next, from one company to another, and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, to whom the company does not belong. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no towering twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Gruppe of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it the Cosmos, in units of "Cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "also imagine that this fund invests in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, in particular, we have them, in particular against the backdrop of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is simultaneously liberated, in which it prefers privileged people, and marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or are we going to sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Luigi Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do so, technological development will produce such a massive reduction in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers described as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By the transmission of this crisis from one part of the earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, therefore I am a libertarian Marxist, and as Keynes, and that is why I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't sleep, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you keep from the view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">We have the appearance of democracy in our liberal democracies.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I dare to say so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can see now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">Now to accuse China of doing what the West did in the 19th century smells huge according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guessed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "to say goodbye to self-complacency, and the continuous denial that a massive throw line went through the eurozone and continues to massively threaten the development of the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was, by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have continued to denounce the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system that is not viable to sustain life through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes take place, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Serious...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he claims that he made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the side of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been carrying out a disastrous programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">This is worse than during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika's troika who imposed this policy confessed:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive sound of the talks, you still seem to be pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if it does not survive, the released powers will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the path of a postmodern 1930 according to what it seems to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard the majority, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studio,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an idiot hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technique, tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows this rating will receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated at nine and above, this will be a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after having watched a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to forbid "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle excesses, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">It requires guaranteed success, so it holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV Shows by analyzing eight candidates, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives out things for nothing, does one intervene, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they don't know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you jump over and look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process it and it results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- a little above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom by four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "receives a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minimum thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work in such a way, then this is a bit frightening because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not discharge takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most exhaustive companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it could be predicted by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the awful way -- by data analysis of the Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year by year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was another sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data also stream into decisions of life -- at work, in legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people unimaginably use a lot of data to make serious choices, such as the decision for a cancer therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years, I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its components, so that you can analyse the components; as a branch, put the individual components together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put it together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise would not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their choices, first when competing for TV ideas, then selecting "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "we tell us the dates." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is pretty useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was any data, this was the device for decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for making decisions using a Jaune or No question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it later with a technical demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a bit more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball will be smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">At the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
