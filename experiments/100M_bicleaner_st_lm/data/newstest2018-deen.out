Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren Institution , where young people should meet today .
a chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn @-@ tunnel .
small farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on days .
it anno@@ ys if maps are not up to date .
everybody knows this , which had to be exciting , because the car Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up to date - but very insi@@ ghtful .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ I , which one cannot recognize as such .
detailed maps , so @-@ called documentary sheets , were incorporated into the large overview map for towns and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian Palace Department between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from Bavaria &apos;s first surve@@ ying .
your Princip@@ al : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally removed the peace from Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was the neighbours of today who created the idea of a regional map of Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV pointed out the project further , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and there@@ with the Bavarian Palace Department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original data sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found like any other on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison of early / today is most impressive on the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
after the creation of the map , Send@@ ling was founded in 18@@ 77 as part of the Munich district .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present @-@ day Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered tracks from the so @-@ called &quot; original recording &quot; from which the land tax was deduc@@ ed .
today , small plots have no more farmers - they are small farmers in the &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is marked north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the site of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , people once locked up people with ins@@ anity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kreis @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was born on the Au@@ er Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden commen@@ ced the establishment - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the mis@@ fortune of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also forbi@@ ds the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the prison .
for 280 patients had first place , later on 500 places were expanded .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ se@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet at the site of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it to a youth home with educational establishments .
West is the football field of TS@@ V München East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural harmony with the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ net , which had been destroyed during the Second World War during bom@@ bing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main place &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bomb planted a lot of holes in the city center .
a big one remained until today - at Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel dating from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days the preliminary work and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line @-@ up line will take place .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights Group publishes travel warnings for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , requires af@@ ro @-@ amer@@ ican travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ ians to pay special attention when travelling through the state , and to be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recent Mis@@ sour@@ i law that makes it harder for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the state &apos;s law enforcement authorities , which are dispro@@ portion@@ ate towards minorities , prompted the group to release the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will be stopped because of their skin color , they will be beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group cited events such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in doub@@ t@@ ful circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more gasoline while traveling through the state and was put in custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of crime .
the Council also points to a recent report of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Prosecutor &apos;s Office in which black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state are recru@@ ited 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Ma@@ ys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring money or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 according to the latest figures from the hate crime report program of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fy the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of discrimination of housing or employment .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had passed immigration laws that bind local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to the further ra@@ cial benefit according to AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .
the Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ ous Project is El@@ ementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ chen@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac presented a picture on site .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U village association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met in the court yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insights into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals supplied and accommod@@ ated in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing trail for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also the president of Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s L@@ H@@ V , he described the Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ ous project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot manage to farm on such steep faces .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area care for a lot of work , much has to be worked on with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not lead a bio operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ au@@ n project and is pleased with the leaders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to carry on their business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of funding
a total of 25 plots were fenced up by eleven participants in 2013 .
the area of the open area is 40 hectares , which are not allowed until at least 20@@ 23 .
half was promoted by leader of the total cost of 71 500 euros , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers left 12,@@ 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and land@@ women . &quot;
Peter Weiß : &quot; here we produce the best food . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Framework Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg allows state funding of pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Black Forest open .
the requirement is the presence of a conveying system described by the L@@ PR .
moreover , the area to be en@@ forced must not be pass@@ able ( slope inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ restra@@ ining Project &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the application of eight participants with 24 plots , who want to build up almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area of disclosure is 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ a Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty ag@@ it@@ ators would have shri@@ ek@@ ed him if he had done it .
but he att@@ aches importance to it , and in particular the meaning attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta stated , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem I refer to , later added , and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who lon@@ gs to breathe freely , / the mis@@ erable litter of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classic visual representation .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she has a very different name : mother of Ex@@ ile .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atism who puts the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not light the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ event@@ h , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black Celeb@@ rates Scottish Members of the UK Team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Director of the UK &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the World Championship Tournam@@ ent will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special developed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m line while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in her fifth world champi@@ onships in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; middle @-@ runner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5.000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch for a great season , which included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team captain says that it is &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me makes it a special thing for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the vot@@ er heating up
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he dab@@ bled in criticism , sure .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
therefore the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a back@@ lash with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it &apos;s a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very clever in using Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ file his hair @-@ free head for chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse advoc@@ ated the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate the whi@@ p online .
the mail talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to the Catholic faith in Ho@@ gans .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the Comments section of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t really appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stance on the same issue , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the govern@@ ors referred to as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ p@@ ses or to arrest demonstr@@ ators and silence .
but that &apos;s exactly what is happening digital .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County wrote the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters fell on his leadership .
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ iz@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .
peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the am@@ ity contract , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance is to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club is hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open in East Lo@@ thi@@ an .
the Nor@@ th@@ re , which last year led to Arch@@ er@@ field left to the final round , before he lost to Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see it reaching its glory with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he laid down this place .
he is an avi@@ d champion of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this is really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the programme in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we always appreciated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to his home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how things went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer through passive smoking
over the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking on lung cancer .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are currently participating in this study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ inger Straße &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the location is more complicated than suspected , as there is much ic@@ eber@@ gs underground in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which obstruc@@ ts construction work time and time , is a major problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts from red lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the scheduled buses are allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z of the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were treated with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and Death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family in the rest@@ less Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay soil - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with mud water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , working late can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , stir@@ red up for independence from the Dutch government , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal monitors from it .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , while the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as seclu@@ ded as it is desolate . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with car rental .
there is no public transport .
the city of about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences and made of corrugated metal roofs that were converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones by rust .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ an worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the poor@@ est province of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ eri@@ ority and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Phoenix Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has min@@ ed gold and copper in worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth around $ 78 billion .
these riches are , however , a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a study conducted in the New York Times in 2005 reported that Free@@ port paid close to $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in a single officer .
Pap@@ ua demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
according to the Asia Human Rights Commission , mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ lands took place in the 1970 &quot; s .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Mak@@ ing Every@@ thing &quot; is called in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , including un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric strikes are especially popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese waiting cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to keep up with it .
&quot; migrants started selling h@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the local Pap@@ ua - the mo@@ m mo@@ m of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the children who were frigh@@ tened told them that they should turn their head@@ lights on .
one of the soldiers stum@@ bled on their tone and later returned to four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk hun@@ ted and beat the group with their gun bombs , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ek@@ o , was struck so hard that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - continuously in a circle and im@@ i@@ ti@@ sing a bird song - from Pap@@ ua &apos;s Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to sling stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated up , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home .
nobody was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his brigh@@ tly painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ in still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just as many Indon@@ esi@@ ans we@@ ars a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because it was attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings was &apos; filtered &apos; until the next day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks ago Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate talk in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he set out an extra @-@ judicial mechanism to settle historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to with@@ drew when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , whom the UN has accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum of 1999 , said that 11 cases of violations of human rights have already been included in Pap@@ ua , including the pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fi@@ erc@@ ely cre@@ dul@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings didn &apos;t stop .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company , who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured have been delivered quickly , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I hid myself in my house for two days . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ y@@ ai &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parliament has called on the officers involved to hold accoun@@ t@@ ability and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an imp@@ etus for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , who claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by inf@@ ring@@ ing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten town . &quot;
poverty is strengthening dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is equally out of range .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
the few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and well @-@ educated migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , the head of the headquarters of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission for filming was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Assistant Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s election campaign were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s most rest@@ less eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six p@@ acific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai firing .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4th May , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but Pap@@ ua comments that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan i@@ ai Cab@@ ins , &quot; said Go@@ bai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants the Jok@@ ov@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , are in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties resulted in a recent symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest homes of the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre @-@ high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which one often calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and shou@@ ting the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said an occup@@ ant who called his name to George , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and the buildings cooled down .
the government said that it is working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the gate building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from facing , outer cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his great Davis Cup coup at the Annual General Meeting .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal to play a Davis Cup single for this sport was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
these often very long , but also therefore very estimated five @-@ set classics , remain thus preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership nation@@ als did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to safeguard the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
after many obj@@ ections , the proposal had already come before the vote to carry out the final at a neutral place .
only comparatively small details are new starting in 2018 : the fin@@ alists at the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host &apos;s right in the first round in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements for training stations etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media meetings before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey conducted among air passengers showed that more than 20 percent of consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the plane while they accidentally wore forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they were late to discover that they had gone mis@@ er@@ ably with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion , or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
from those surv@@ ey@@ ed who agreed that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something forbidden by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , who were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent admit to have know@@ ingly carried articles with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female surv@@ ey@@ ed and 3.7 percent of the male surv@@ ey@@ ed also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the plane .
the company said there were travellers all over the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently brought s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security and how many had intentionally done it .
it is no surprise that people who have the most s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly the most frequent .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they may take with you or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could see books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : cancell@@ ations of tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers order
electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has so far failed to make sure that some of the customers have already retired their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another less brilliant figure when announc@@ ing the latest quar@@ terly balance : that of the cancell@@ ations for the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car whose delivery has just begun .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3.000 re@@ treats have already been withdrawn from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have always pointed out that they are only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 US Dollar and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely .
currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations have been submitted , mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
by 2018 , all models will be together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day .
if you order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new production lines tested never before in practice with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if there are major delays , then the non @-@ binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA &apos;s CEO P@@ ru@@ dent withdraw@@ s because of the lack of rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
a day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions smo@@ g caused air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ it presented the change as its agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline which expi@@ red on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground @-@ to @-@ earth o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ dent announced in June that he will delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or to im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of severe environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations which resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ pe@@ as regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Employment Tribunal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ de proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply reinfor@@ ces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previous administr@@ ations , the EP@@ O often failed to meet dead@@ lines for execution and then waited to be prosec@@ uted by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement setting the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA &apos;s opinion that P@@ ru@@ de will eventually use its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on sound policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the O@@ zone rules .
the draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Senate did not yet vote in the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the New York Public Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who pres@@ ided over the coalition of States that the EPA issued during this week , the group deliber@@ ated to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when harmful substances from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about P@@ ru@@ it &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Centre for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday 16th July at 4 : 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth benefit ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in town have made the friends and sponsors tum@@ ul@@ tuous their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ en@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württemberg Ur@@ customer &apos;s book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
in addition to the former parish church , the wording of the document , besides the former parish church , was also a marvel@@ ous farm belonging to the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age right and not the other way around .
there were also people there .
as you can see from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen today , the &quot; Berg &quot; is the third , the village &apos;s beautiful settlement centre .
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ pin these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval self @-@ Church law .
a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
this ent@@ ailed the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the elder of the two bar@@ bar@@ ed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 , French troops camped near the church .
they broke out pul@@ pit and church mill and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from radio @-@ bro@@ kers .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower could be left .
in the New Year night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower @-@ tower existing today remained as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em cultivate the Hil@@ arius system as success@@ ors to Dieter D@@ ock@@ horn .
as organis@@ ers invite the friends and sponsors tum@@ lin@@ s on Sunday , 16th July , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ en@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the subur@@ b of Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann talks about the final word .
the program starts at 4 : 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
for the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade a drink takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers provide the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and listeners .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ arc are particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med .
association intends to review wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ eps itself &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land@@ rat .
the Bo@@ is@@ heim club has called on &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim region .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there existed only a wind power @-@ concentration zone at the boundary of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
in this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; as@@ par@@ agus &quot; of the landscape .
a few days earlier , the city Vier@@ sen had decided to change the land use plan a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but it did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf because of a fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning permission , the approved approval decision is still illegal and therefore also reluc@@ tant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the city council renewed the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; explan@@ atory : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded according to plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance to the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the respective writings have been in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them as an occasion to examine the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
looking at the proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans the construction of four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim river .
already last year , the company , in which the city Vier@@ sen particip@@ ates indirectly , signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large area .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households will be covered - this equ@@ ates to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ person households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Kreis Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ Wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in this process .
two more people were easily injured .
the national road was closed for hours .
according to police instructions a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car carried the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person .
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ ei@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre .
the trade association and the municipal administration plan to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the city center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the president of the business club , Christian König announced , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers what offers their own city away from the usual supermarket merchandise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies should present themselves with their apprentices@@ hip places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are intended to invite for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotion aims not only to residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which indicate the action weekend , are Christian König .
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the commercial club and the city will go into another stage of the &quot; Attrac@@ tive Down@@ town &quot; project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the well festival with sold Sunday , talks with all craftsmen and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be newly or re @-@ developed .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many local people lost the city center when shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to help en@@ li@@ ven the city center - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly expanded , king said in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that Germany &apos;s third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; date will take part in five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the au@@ spices of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her purchasing behaviour directly .

Tr@@ ump put on pressur@@ ized tran@@ scripts from telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump wrote in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president beg@@ ged him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and revealed an intense exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who went to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; de@@ pot &quot; after propos@@ ing a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford massacre : activists return rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ man Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a needle @-@ stri@@ pe suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of the audience had a very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists come back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge in order to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ col@@ m as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone &apos;s Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organisation of post @-@ employment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and one life long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays down a blanket over the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the open for decades , citizens &apos; rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the summer .
at about the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com follows a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they got away from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in murder , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of whom would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said it &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t establish a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the Black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene had a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of the boss @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es out and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona does not respond to the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs best .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers sw@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ cona is saying the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition continues violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a sorrow of mour@@ ning stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays in mour@@ ning glory &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers swe@@ eps sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ers took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ ur as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks a lot - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did this for one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later , the audience sat down with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair from Atlanta talks about the after@@ math with a black pair they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words , which feeling the performance had left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone respects Broo@@ ks &apos;s farm at his table , eating and remember@@ ing the civil rights .
he said he had already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ employment is in a way inspiring , for it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; ( Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung ) in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf uses a multi @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ storey setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with the wall of the wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ in and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park in which the Rhein@@ mort@@ ars pose as a rock energy pose , or alternatively an is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - which goes through his &quot; Ring &quot; production .
the three daughters of the Rhine - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
K@@ ES@@ S lead her to Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , rip a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ wal@@ o @-@ cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the del@@ ici@@ ously nasty Hagen surrounding the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box .
brutal scene when he sho@@ cks Siegfried .
later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated in a stor@@ my way , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bows down and bends the hands of the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which presents itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothing .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly anticipated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to let go of a pillar of the Pfei@@ f@@ Concerto for himself , there was a great jubil@@ ation five years later , in which the isolated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went underground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have enjoyed this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also has grown an understanding for its view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I will help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at the school in the open day .
what are your experiences with it ?
a lot : it &apos;s a nice wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that come from ?
amount : I graduated from school .
and then a civil engineer studies , we say , successfully broken off .
I recognized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something different with people working .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point , maybe , really .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study a dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , do a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always depends on where you are going to be FS@@ J .
it can be made from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon supervision .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes down .
different from studying civil engineering ?
a lot : well , here it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating St@@ ati@@ ks .
you always have other people up@@ side down , each having a whole different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a youth , has been taken out of the family - you have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
a lot : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just that way .
Pear@@ son shor@@ tens more 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , that it will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure confron@@ ting the company .
the job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , will in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 points have already been lost .
in May , in a third cost cutting programme Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) to rein@@ vigor@@ ate a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann in the past month , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter had been hurt , shared an explanation of NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
bom@@ bing is the last violent crime that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of Nato , it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; explo@@ ded &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at the airport of B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops crushed the Tali@@ ban in 2001 by power .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have caused a crisis of public trust in the government , policy and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns the decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay Obama &apos;s government regulation , which states that states are bound to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states compl@@ ained of the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ O announced late on Wednesday the decision to push forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Reg@@ ulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that it will show the agency &apos;s commitment to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EP@@ O leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump is supposed to boost economic growth .
however , efforts have triggered the return of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the effects of greater emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that the inhal@@ ation of air containing o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduces lung function and can increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common Council wants community room
in the end , the decision was clear : with two opposing voices , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ el@@ ands decided to set up a shared space in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still lacking part of the plot was signed , reported may@@ ors Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will take some time until the area belonging to the church community has belonged to the church community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor any more .
there is a discussion about a common room for this .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council ve@@ ers in front of seeing such a common room not as a meeting place just for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous dwelling but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget in the past fall , is covered by funding opportunities .
the building is in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
according to T@@ j@@ ades , the establishment of a shared space would be capable of supporting 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal fores@@ ees to signal the investor that in this respect , no bil@@ let is to be thrown between the legs , stating that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as pent roof - which reduce the height of the tr@@ ump and make the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer does not mean this addition .
if it helps : he unanim@@ ously passes the body .
it is not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points out to the many own buildings with which one can &apos;t really move forward , but now they lean out of the window in the common room , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very difficult with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is strictly speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it sees behind it a concealed subsi@@ dy to property or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area there is no subsi@@ dy , but a real counter@@ value which is market@@ able in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
for Sta@@ ge@@ ers &apos;s request to choose the proposed resolution , there are three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision so we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision by car : Rad@@ ler is hur@@ led on the road
at the crossing of the road a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was caught by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and seriously injured .
as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road along the cycle path of the Schwar@@ zer road from direction to Hil@@ den .
the senior willing to cross the road at the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch hill .
a passenger car driver travelling in the same direction gave priority to him .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went to the street , he obviously didn &apos;t pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic .
he met with a car who controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ing car .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to let the game play against Dortmund .
with human resources , the FC Bayern is travelling to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup competition against the winner .
the human resources at the German Soccer @-@ Record Champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger @-@ Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti will not have to give up on David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical state and the missing balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official obligatory play of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play smart , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who anticip@@ ates a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans under their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Soccer League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
mig@@ rate from star to star in resin
the first &quot; Star@@ path &quot; is to be created in the Harz Mountains .
this is the planning of the Association &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; ( Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg ) .
a Plan@@ etary Trail is located in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommo@@ dates the need for information of many har@@ z go@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up charts along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check out St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network receipt plays a role in selecting a location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Ticket to Ride will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star trail , viewers will learn a lot of interesting facts , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another , even though it is far more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg the highest con@@ stellation in northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy are visible with naked eye .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Indian@@ apolis , there is something similar to the planned star@@ light - the planet path@@ way .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e that forms the interior of our solar system , the planet trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Municip@@ ality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to down@@ gra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun that is exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the total distance of the planet trail is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fix star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion , down the hall@@ way to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization super @-@ spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ m@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he has to move to light weight trucks &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans expect .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked if it should be Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their weight @-@ weight battle in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he considered Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous compli@@ ment to Gar@@ cia and said he thinks that the three @-@ combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ out . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show drummer , then boxing .
both said they could sense the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injuries to the Ty@@ re plat@@ ter
in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon .
after first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the entry point of the market , shortly before the entry point in the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the slope , where he over@@ came and then stayed on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the North for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; chain works better &quot;
after the 2 : 2 season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes to optimize the defense formation in Au@@ e points after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener .
with the first match of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , even if the two fo@@ es had not been at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two fo@@ es too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the def@@ enders from Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the supply chain is also to be further optimized .
and a gate after a free stroke do not want to capture the For@@ tun@@ en any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one will stand alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team gets better with the experience in preparation with the Chain Bridge than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know yet how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have players in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ el@@ mann &apos;s half positions that can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prerequisite is , however , that we can harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t have so many short@@ com@@ ings in the structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know anything about it .
&quot; the start of the season I judge only after six to eight seasons , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a thunder@@ storm .
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the Au@@ e players might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for an advancement tile in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 per cent as they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Home Defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland will be an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we are entitled to go under the first six is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is only positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ li@@ ga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s head coach .
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ age evaluation tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden submitted to a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Medic@@ inal Medic@@ inal Di@@ et ) have started the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
to date , migration has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to be tested and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; probably 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been stable over the past few months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said , The Local .
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det investig@@ ates the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Go@@ el@@ sson of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is negli@@ gible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is if the person is under 18 , in that case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ tonne concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good in time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Building and Traffic at the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg .
in April , the works started at the same time on all three rehabilitation @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , crosses the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges cross the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively , 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side has now received a 1,@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border fast@@ ener , which is also used as a mode of operation .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2,@@ 20 metre wide bridge is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to go .
the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
in the run @-@ up to the work , local residents were informed of the project by hand@@ outs .
in addition , fish and cra@@ bs had to be f@@ ished first .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the railway station in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is easily regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach place entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three bridges are EUR 700 000 .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which would otherwise be difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the Reich@@ stag ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on that day because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle in R@@ ond@@ ell , according to the poster &quot; big campaign opening act . &quot;
and known names at the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ tier forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chair@@ person Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ erly , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain site , but now takes place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organis@@ ers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and plenty of food , among them a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ur@@ German potato salad which also the Af@@ D could eat without problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered a lot of civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein . they show presence in particular at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes is reported by the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel to make an effort to get such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a refusal because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pe is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
looking at the event at the rear of the fund , he says , &quot; This is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
it also does this : at about 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate German Af@@ D chair Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 people in the audience waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ person Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little over an hour the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 9@@ pm .
the police can press down - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , there is a re@@ union with the Wolf singer Freder@@ ic B@@ elli tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto Black Sea meets Black Forest , or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ er is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo orchestra of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sings with Bulgarian folklore and in the song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the jazz piano player N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classics , jazz and free games ming@@ le with a fascinating synthesis of the arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this core part of the program was first performed this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart lam@@ ents about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart for her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known Hollywood star relationship was Robert P@@ att@@ inson &apos;s &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague , who ultimately dealt bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin advis@@ es the Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with anyone I had . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think I &apos;d played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in the du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she especially suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in school time when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven the children told me I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to behave in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself in front of the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as a citizen of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifestation broke out in rejo@@ icing .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited coal from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee announced on Thursday evening a declaration in which it said : &quot; the party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather hin@@ der us from working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is without leadership from top to bottom , and is unable to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; said R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement to the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed into sports .
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were cut away gold and silver med@@ als at competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state sponsored Dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation recognized in itself that it experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een r@@ ussi@@ an athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships that begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the Director of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
drug testing is still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he told repor@@ ters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral service for soldiers crashed in Mali
during a funeral service in the northern h@@ ess@@ ischen F@@ ritz@@ lar approximately 1000 people of the two thought about a helicopter crash in Mali over@@ looked soldiers .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister of Defence , Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing to the un@@ resolved cause of the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two surrounding pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their specialist &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead vi@@ gi@@ l of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon only the members of the church f@@ arewell .
after that began the funeral in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens premi@@ er Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Federal Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the ro@@ ses settled down with ro@@ ses , the relatives were standing arm in arm on the coff@@ ins .
before the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ yen called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surrounding soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ anic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann constructed the flight operations of the helicopter Tiger at F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ feld , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this occupation failed to prevent the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN Mission in Mali did not show Prime Minister of the Le@@ yen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are being buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
the King &apos;s House was divided on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally attached to the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ n already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agrees with her husband &apos;s decision , she said further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also retired the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ nant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House , said .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the past 50 years .
the native @-@ born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife &apos;s sympath@@ ies with the people , Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was sw@@ inging , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of social @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday for the dissolution of Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising withdrawal of a Green party from their State Parliament faction in Lower Saxony had thrown down the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its close one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green party El@@ ke T@@ westen founded her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) in 2018 .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
CD@@ U Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ urg@@ ler wants to recommend his Group to take it .
thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the parliament of Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
up to now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be elected regularly on January 14 next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ur@@ ler , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Parliament decides to resolve its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U will probably decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Land@@ tag draws trust to the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be legally tested , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ur@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sm@@ ur@@ king called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ern@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the apost@@ ate de@@ pu@@ ties to return their land @-@ day mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that it returns its agricultural machinery , which it has received through the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chairman of the State Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we depl@@ ore the decision made by El@@ ke T@@ westen remark@@ ably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliberately decided not to speak any pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition from El@@ ke T@@ westen Lower Saxony to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the chief of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit to the west costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political scientist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her van@@ ities and fru@@ stration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty game of intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ urg@@ ler wants to recommend his MPs to take El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .
the party leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , repro@@ ached T@@ westen with personal career plans to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 state election .
the CD@@ U was , at that time , strongest force in front of the SPD , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in parliament .
interview with Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sies , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal be ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
the Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is talking to the German editorial team ( R@@ ND ) in an interview .
Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will present the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to all that we currently know , a health risk is practically impossible .
Al@@ di now takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ tenment is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has switched on without delay and since the announcement of Germany &apos;s const@@ ern@@ ation in close contact with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has as much concern as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are bu@@ si@@ cal and harmless to health .
if the residual residual content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the present state of knowledge , the production facilities are not directly responsible .
on the contrary , they have to expect economic damage because of the presum@@ ably illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too few controllers in the case of emergency .
is there only a lack of personnel or a coher@@ ent competence ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys in the cases in which criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made a number of times that I expect complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and capable food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
the pan@@ try means that manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide &apos;s fi@@ pron@@ il in keeping food delivery animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts are resolved swiftly and without gaps .
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed spending of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champion league tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A means that PS@@ G has to prove that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will be tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team due to the rich host family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but they must interact with legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively dul@@ led and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners reloc@@ ated their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration to clubs debt to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model used by Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch in 2003 in Chelsea has bought a club with potential and invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , the UEF@@ A successor , A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to dis@@ courage excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P compared to The Associated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cataly@@ tic company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing was to exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA &apos;s sponsor@@ ship was backed up by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will be ambassador and that such a maneu@@ ver would be easy for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year need to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales after signature will rise by at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would breach the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finan@@ ces an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new lap supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline dict@@ ates the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be insp@@ ected every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packed sho@@ ot@@ ings of 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants to the passengers prior to landing .
Swiss does not want to make any statements about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders appreciate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a manufacturer of sho@@ cks .
the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y the number of applicants with the new ten@@ dering .
but only Swiss manufacturers are eligible for this .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on Spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate boards distribute the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut has supplied chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of First Class are treated with goo@@ dies by the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class ni@@ bble passengers scho@@ gg@@ i by Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things .
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a speaking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by dividing to the core of the g@@ ag - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who grow up - nevertheless they managed to reg@@ ain the im@@ possibility of reg@@ aining the last part of the wi@@ t .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with its adults , who are now playing adult , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more according to the casting principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
at one point , a character clas@@ hes with an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things dating back to 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now roman@@ ce writer , still hasn &apos;t forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy vi@@ cious plot which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ written impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s under@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sing@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that could pre@@ heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band how they will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of Americans , to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East versus West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alist I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues are du@@ b@@ bed by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Find out the Voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is included - that it often plays like a single one .
there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited on a lower length could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lob@@ b@@ ying lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police managed to beat the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor Kon@@ stanz announced on Friday .
in doing so , 15 accused persons were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials saw large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as hundreds of thousands of euros .
in the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
there were German warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore presum@@ ably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investigations were involved in the campaign .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crime , heavy violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating cont@@ est@@ ants against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large insert was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
especially Italian nation@@ als with a close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia in the sight of the investigations .
a incident on May 27 at Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank &apos;s bank account .
manner lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions concerning asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the German Federal Government Commissioner , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to a media report on large gaps in the Central Register of For@@ eig@@ ners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data registered there could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead to some serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned in an analysis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the Registry , including some 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
according to this , the data is managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data have not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can dec@@ eler@@ ate reverse processes , &quot; according to the report .
in the statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included who do not need to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false orders led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with ex@@ cre@@ tes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is , in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years of age when they have entered the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , the paper says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF leads such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding families with children - except infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , according to the newspaper &apos;s reference to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state are in charge of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant continues to move to another EU country , this state can send it back to the en@@ rol@@ ment country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy issued warran@@ ties for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficiently .
other EU states would also return refugees in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights due to defects in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
the blood donation service provided a total of 220 liters of blood of persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations in the meantime .
traditionally , in the session of the Municipal Council , the community appreci@@ ates the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is fantastic how our body is created for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Kreis@@ station@@ manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bach , because the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s how three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bach reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K round@@ about manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the change to the theatre house obviously resulted in higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry counted the maj@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half as many re@@ book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter passed 500 milli@@ liter of their juice every ten times per 500 milli@@ liter .
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will probably later announce that the interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members pursuing a rise this month , as weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years interest rate increases would be necessary in order to brid@@ le the inflation so@@ lic@@ ited by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the bor@@ rowing costs would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the M@@ amm@@ ut Business Pack@@ et published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time to finance the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of February , although it is expected that it will now provide € 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; following the decision on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates , she repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forec@@ asted growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are up to 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to those projected in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell on these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision not to change after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on interest rate increase and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast provided little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases as the tigh@@ tening process will be worse before it gets better .
she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; prevent &quot; the in@@ comes freeze , &quot; but she added that wages are &quot; clearly &quot; rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated at the end of their three @-@ year projection .
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will offset some of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote which caused the collapse of the cause .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will completely reach the prices and the economy .
prior to the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ turn of the swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as credi@@ tors are clam@@ our@@ ing for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) aims to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a high @-@ court fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis , which was recorded prior to sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by health services via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS would have the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS UK boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
Pre@@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in hazardous areas .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken everyday or just two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in Clin@@ ics , suitable candidates who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive acquisition .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , which is used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ haul the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in tackl@@ ing one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Board of Terror H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due after months of delay and deliber@@ ate implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt takes us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV , and to contribute to getting closer to the eradic@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living a big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , grew out of a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one bedroom estate with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was my requirement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is rather complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of one another without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area for the mezzanine .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ le lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window to another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went into it , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; it is opposite , so that when you push the door , it moves very smoothly . &quot;
thanks to clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and elevated square footage of some standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers res@@ ide four decades after their Italian family founded the Dy@@ nasty , in a dispute over one of the largest real estate empire in Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a Villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be split .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there , the West@@ co je@@ ans family founded je@@ ans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - von Paul described as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court record says that this means that Col@@ in owns $ 316 million worth of USD $ 176 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the breakdown of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul of managing some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says , he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs arise in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties .
Mr@@ s De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early 1970 &apos;s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property where Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to disclose her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
Luke and Mark are , according to Paul , &quot; bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in was very restra@@ ined even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and drag our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the pres@@ idency &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
poli@@ tico reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more smooth course .
here is a piece of Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive staff on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wanted to rep@@ ay : bad information that fell into the president &apos;s hands .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by over@@ seeing his media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos; s Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know from others - that tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets could have contained even more combus@@ ti@@ bles without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets which Tr@@ ump did not send .
if his staff made it a few times to keep anno@@ y@@ ance from him , then their efforts paid off .
but no one has been able to consistently prevent Tr@@ ump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to bring forward their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump materials that may promote their views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO , busy with this story , reported in May about the fon@@ dness of advis@@ ors to provide doub@@ t@@ ful information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he tries to figure out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone vi@@ ci@@ ously accused the President of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ new@@ .com , the web site of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to ch@@ ic@@ ans or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has rejected false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began to question people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tr@@ ump receives . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe send out ( virtual ) postal cards to dangerous criminals .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heav@@ y@@ weights are not known naturally , references from the population will be collected and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ ets hide at holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
there are 21 post@@ cards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there is the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ .@@ latex , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
36 of the online convic@@ tions could be det@@ ained so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of references after publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some decided travellers on the bar@@ racks , which have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire row &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a bur@@ ial dug by the Council to prevent their invasion .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section which remained un@@ imped@@ ed to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must , by shame , be forced into action , as it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more came last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long teachings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying for my local charge if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a local who didn &apos;t want to be named said : &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and one even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep it as fast as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to support our collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior at the police by calling 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we do our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Birken@@ hof through the former ambience operating company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , about 30,000 qualifying stays per year were lost and revenues were also paid by the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building was offered to the district office as a shelter , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , defended the hotel location and already spoke to the house by serious potential customers .
he should be right .
the group of Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ers , purchased the former Birken@@ hof at a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to return it to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ era and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you name Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former hotel Birken@@ hof , construction sh@@ utt@@ ling containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when entering the house , it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do by March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
everything should later be &quot; pretty ci@@ vic &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
it is not desirable to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer appreci@@ ates .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
when it comes to investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point exactly .
less than a million euros , he expects .
the outer comple@@ xes are also brought forward to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace that is accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : United States Special Issu@@ er sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special issu@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller has set up a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee has resum@@ ed its work in recent weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in appeal to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper described the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N transmitter reported that there are already initial invitations from the committee in connection with a meeting between the Tr@@ um@@ ps el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for some time being targeted at the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigation , several men are to stand , who acted as advis@@ ers of the Republi@@ cans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more dr@@ um@@ ps in a private and business environment .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the special agent Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the centre and accused the accus@@ ation that the President may have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ists is to check present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to prosec@@ ute charges .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called anchor clips .
most of the time , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the committee may also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in order to invite persons to inter@@ ro@@ gate under oath .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps Ad@@ vis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election campaign chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the discussion .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the suspension showed that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary he wanted to act quickly .
it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new ground for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the democr@@ ats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement , he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
but this work also usually works secretly , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special interc@@ essor in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I chief , James Com@@ ey , said three times that it was not determined against the President .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the Declaration .
but Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ro@@ oting , repro@@ aches against Tr@@ ump have become loud , he wanted to obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a setting up of the investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special issu@@ er and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would release .
unlike an independent special promot@@ er of the Congress such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ air around the later rec@@ eded President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the insist@@ ence of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented bills on Thursday before the special intermedi@@ aries could not be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the Western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been solved by the scar@@ ce seven @-@ fold size of Berlin .
this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the giant col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice @-@ gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for human beings .
according to research information , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
overall , however , for around 30 years there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now abor@@ ted col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ vio is floating on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ vio is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
at the north of this bowl , the balance between wa@@ xing and breaking off was disturbed several years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete Sch@@ el@@ vio there .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never been as far withdrawn as at present .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key .
melting of ice hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting .
however , the loss of the bell cheese causes the glaci@@ ers to flow straight into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly raise sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ vio is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not lead to the departure of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many of the polar treasures of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long tip of the Antar@@ ctic is stretching towards South America .
according to the research programme of the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature contributed to the decline .
over the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and t@@ ames it to the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls on the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the working day had a 41 new job in the administration .
more than 1100 cler@@ ks and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have completed their first day of work .
the teachers at the circle are apparently very much sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications had been filed for the places to be published this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at the moment , there are still 50 vac@@ ant positions in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things doctors and engineers and forces of general administration are sought .
together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the U@@ WG and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is to develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development at the request of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act forward @-@ looking application scar@@ city , it is said .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate both internally and externally , show concrete measures for lateral entran@@ ts and include a training campaign , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities recru@@ it good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a large number of employees who leave the ministry due to illness or age .
so it is high time for action so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , Group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he took care of a la@@ zy surprise early on in the working day , when he publicly challenged human resources coverage and start@@ led the remaining parties .
people want all possibilities to be checked that allow a exit from the local employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we fail to find a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a ho@@ ur@@ ly tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U seeks to pay better for employees and officials than is actually envis@@ aged by the public service tari@@ ff .
the sal@@ aries are prescribed exactly at the moment , increases or more money is only available if one changes to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new premises had to be established , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor von Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the sound of an NGO migrants &apos; rescue boat
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use emergency boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they can &apos;t continue this if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said interior minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat to the German charity &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation only a year ago , refused to comment on detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment , &quot; the organization said in a statement on the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are delivered to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can shut off so that ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of being over@@ seen by the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , above all , must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations have now agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel Prize winner is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy tri@@ als and sights for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .
view points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there were again and again longer asc@@ ents , for the long Tri@@ als reward .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk fest saus@@ age market .
again , the viewpoint was located at the look@@ out point , connected with &quot; flo@@ wer@@ y &quot; trials and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and settlements brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers found healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ li@@ ga gears up for e @-@ sport
are sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium race ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with heavy weights included .
the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga societies have also recognized this , which are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire brand new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure that some clubs are moving on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; where gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must in particular have to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent electric sports@@ men under contract you could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ anna to Asia .
what is it all about ?
at E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or &quot; Soccer @-@ Simulation FIFA are being fought on a competition level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen long ago established itself in which the professionals compete against each other .
and for the Asian Games 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it really a kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ oso dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show lots of biological and physical reactions , which are also found in classic sports - such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ atic also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
the scientist has a positive effect on the high integr@@ ative effect of the e @-@ sport .
the players are traveling internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study by the Del@@ o@@ itte business consultancy and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for E @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tour@@ neys .
sales are expected to rise to 130 million in three years .
this is not a little against the 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte Ad@@ vis@@ ors write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the U.S. , where former basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition from Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot of things are happening in Europe as well .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a class of instruction , says F@@ rob@@ ek .
in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league football clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in European comparison Germany is lag@@ ging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to dec@@ eive only in nostal@@ gia and to glori@@ fy the old times is no longer sufficient .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company with the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; D@@ utt says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t remember that only football everything stays the way it was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy tried to commit suicide
a Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June due to the negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , folded hands and eyes facing down when she was condemned .
&quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; the prosec@@ utor told the court .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz however said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day when I don &apos;t get the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain , which we will carry for eternity . &quot;
Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , testified that she was &quot; persecuted &quot; by the recognition that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together every day since I was born , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; hang up , spring out of a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Car@@ ter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as captain is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern is a big season for the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt there .
something was different to his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ Mail immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philip L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er could be seen , he made himself tied to his arm .
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards told afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bayern @-@ captain .
well , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also indicate Kim@@ Mail .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , consisting of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and especially from holidays , but he .
sugar is most often distributed to those whom you trust a lot that you want to keep in a good mood .
so those who were chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ Mail affir@@ med : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ ck@@ led over the field as a mini l@@ ame .
right at the back , that &apos;s his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and at all , Kim@@ ber@@ ly worked in this initial formation , just like the one who can best take the helm .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal started playing his missing fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches succeeded in connecting on the devil to get out of the achievements of Asia &apos;s journey ( foldable only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not fall neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
this was very good at all .
Sü@@ le running beside Kim@@ olos , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted sovereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm often proved heavy , and addic@@ ted to the game set @-@ up a few times .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not what we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a good performance during his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was picked up too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ accustomed this Bayern @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw afterwards in the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two interviews in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye after a few words in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I &apos;ve already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he no longer has to teach the new .

David Al@@ aba , believes in the success of our Ö@@ FB @-@ ladies
Austria &apos;s best known foot@@ b@@ aller registered on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the Ö@@ FB @-@ ladies all the best .

the twe@@ eter of the Austrian football tournament of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation sy@@ ringe .
the famous Bayern @-@ Dus@@ el might also need our ladies well .
companies satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often unfor@@ giving , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region talk to T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , chairman of the Vereinigung Tri@@ erer Association ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the largest turning point in infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
the Ministry is still hoping for a planning process this year , until 2021 should be entitled to construction law .
the western surrounding of Trier is also playing a role in the plans of the country , which is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan .
the goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Mini@@ steri@@ al spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competitive enterprises .
as von Wis@@ sing , the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier is aiming for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports being sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Industry .
the Chamber of Crafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 euro is fores@@ een for the passed master examination and 2500 Euros , if graduates themselves become independent within ten years of the master &apos;s education .
but the home@@ work schedule for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is quick to provide facts , but at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
so far only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire bis@@ ons in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 less in the receipt of national roads than suggested .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies only rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK pol@@ l with the grade 3.@@ 4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ outs .
on the other hand , ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is out of politics and sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where , after four months of in@@ consist@@ encies , it already cleared the field .
Audi to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Chairman said that the company believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and was referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - forbi@@ dding or restric@@ ting diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe in order to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des em@@ itted by diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and may cause asthma .
the cost of automotive manufacturers to install exhaust gases re@@ pul@@ sed from diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of us@@ ur@@ ping the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees of Volkswagen were indic@@ ted , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft through Munich takes a special message on Saturday morning .
if you go back to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building reference &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to clear up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the raft one sees a great deal of information .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a worthy of protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft passed through the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los St@@ ollen n@@ oses and the Lau@@ ghter against Sor@@ ry
at times Mor@@ di@@ llo has been one of the most widely publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the lab@@ yr@@ n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ er still draws and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he proposed himself among other things as a sig@@ nat@@ ory for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
following stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came into being at the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo has found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
according to his own information in the early morning , he still lives on the drawing table today , works almost ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ pl@@ ets continue to find widespread circulation around the world .
for six years he has also worked on a carto@@ on animation and a TV series with his characters .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand foot@@ er than opponent .
his figures speak for the first time in the 3D film , which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re going to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
this is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence is threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is retro@@ grade due to the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and insect @-@ borne insects , which causes great head@@ aches for scientists and farmers who try to find solutions .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M Agricultural Research Institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered as the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years , which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ ca@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and there are many of them in very dry weather . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only temp@@ ting for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ issa said : &quot; instead of having very long vegetable clo@@ cks with a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with e@@ there@@ al oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the little town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian town of R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 anniversary .
the festival highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
cranes , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ aries or a country ski camp are to be experienced in the city center on these days .
assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest of violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her publisher and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep though his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hung on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the 19@@ 30s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although an At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only introduced two criminal proceedings pursuant to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , which are associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely indic@@ ted .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ able and even though the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why we are mi@@ str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left behind a wife and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing to silence about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos; arrest last year and the surrender to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot on the street every day , or that the grav@@ eyard is full of em@@ belli@@ shed two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has the control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed ga@@ ys bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar equity hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug poison issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising grew .
repor@@ ters loved being able to publish rigor@@ ous investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for the courage to prosec@@ ute the Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; traffi@@ cking in drugs in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ s@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take on the task you are listening to as a journalist - either you or you are playing the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was cur@@ sing like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was His love for routine destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how best to do her job and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing has happened to J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the space where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days before , it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce offices in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class neighbourhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in a joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor himself regarded as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has looked at three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known bo@@ xer , Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to government spending , concentr@@ ating on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group sitting in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducting a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the entire century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous events in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military raid .
only a few months before , readers would have looked at the readers of Val@@ dez as the best informed sources of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; in the past we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; for his slender body fitting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Val@@ dez office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers against mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country , journalists have become ph@@ one@@ tic by writing down in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on side@@ walks and constructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice system in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and letting them kill because they told the truth .
she has since been asked to be re@@ organized by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials involved and an equivalent society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who put under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media fan group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found together with a note allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone lay next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua following the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly ad@@ jour@@ ned to the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the roads and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it &apos;s a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking frigh@@ tens him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when at one time all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan Bath centre had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as it was promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they released the news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website about mobile phones .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ aped up nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid they didn &apos;t show it .
under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s employees followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day J@@ avier was assass@@ inated , inter@@ ns asked me to send them to the street for reporting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , although a sc@@ ary .
researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ er have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had had something of an &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has ba@@ ff@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that seemed out of place by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy ear@@ thy cl@@ um@@ ps .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ ble a changing tank , probably have been threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique that is known as counter sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and do@@ dge its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours studying it carefully .
the astonishing maintenance of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure by eating meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution further@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ age - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the cra@@ yon time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on information about his life , including his preserved presentation content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he s@@ unk on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved skin , but retains its original shape and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early chal@@ k time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have to stra@@ y a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
this includes the ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cover of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the house branches are still covering wooden plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as winning the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
c@@ logged residues of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates carrying the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales on its sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ resting on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ cade .
there are numerous wounded , kilometers long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) about 20 people were injured at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age late on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information of the police at 5@@ pm between the connecting points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , crashed into each other .
at first there were no information about the exact number of injured persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of light to medium @-@ weight injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long tail@@ gate was formed in the direction of travel in Munich .
as reported by an A@@ Z repor@@ ter , there was also massive disabilities on the opposite @-@ track - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade listed the characteristics of the vehicle en@@ ker , which now have to calculate with delicate pen@@ alties .
shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are immersed in his work and just have a brilliant thought .
and then : buffer .
when the conductor comes and w@@ akes an unpleasant , or tear the passenger into the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing automatic ticket control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to vali@@ date the ticket .
a test operation is currently running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be available on many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the name of the train without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements need to be met : a smartphone or tablet needs to be met .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
it also has to be purchased via the App of the railway , which is the DB navig@@ ator , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you get into the train , call his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic validation appears with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at place Y at the ticket inspection , he knows there is a passenger sitting there with an already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue to work , keep quiet .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should be used by passengers .
&quot; those who want to travel without a ticket inspection by our train crew will simply check in in the DB Navigator .
this allows passengers to make their journey more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB TV marketing executive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest offen@@ ders .
because often you don &apos;t have all the documents you need to vali@@ date online tickets in any case , but one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents required .
either the credit card or ID card or otherwise a document you have to present .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to poor tuning in the compartment or large space and delays in checking your own tickets and taking the conductor in the end time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that applies only to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same track are not available yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a mail from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as no one else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ we@@ ed at her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was about to twe@@ eted the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and left there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought with himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and to their community .
she put her cell phone off to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photographs of the police band and people crying out , and of a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a shield with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman said his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l rec@@ alled their statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence , which consists of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation which they had inn@@ um@@ erable times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t take her away , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up therein .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to get free to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women @-@ child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would do it a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police force that became a camp area when the activists were awaiting the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed totally after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r just wanted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resili@@ ence .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We have heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already co@@ operated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his engagement made Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other natives , followed by the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary isn &apos;t someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who , after the murder of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , in 2012 saw the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter , &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women must carry the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook her energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime the telecommunic@@ ation cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have disappeared long ago , but the ra@@ cial connections between the town@@ ship and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a singing and she feels bound to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers will discuss about bit gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not yet built .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the subject hardly leaves cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build a gallery to attract more customers to the city , and the other businesses also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the plot in which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the start of construction work will be finished .
the gallery operators want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a place with the possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years we have been buying in the farmers market hall almost every week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the con@@ cu@@ bin@@ es again and again very gladly .
we discovered the but@@ cher shop for us too .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall will settle in the gallery will amount to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this should probably not be very low with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I don &apos;t think it is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of this in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is at the top of the price .
as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies , as the r@@ ents there are often un@@ sustainable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably even disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall go down during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes along .
or does the gh@@ ost bit gallery already manage to drive all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
and there is no need for a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but thanks to the incredibly many - as I think - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg don &apos;t give a place for a farmer &apos;s market hall .
when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting resem@@ b@@ lance : artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which almost resem@@ ble themselves - hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ ck@@ ern and Haar@@ etz , who were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after making public diplom@@ acy about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ singer and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , through algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , a sharp , though some intellectual comment not only to the forms of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but had already talked openly about identification as a woman since she pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the law of es@@ pion@@ age , computer sc@@ ams and theft .
through the prison their image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black and white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .
that was the time when she received an email from a magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t visit at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal bri@@ ph@@ ews , which over the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the president would form@@ ulate Over@@ seas judgement and would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama was actually calling Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome sort of happy gathering .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid spl@@ its that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called with her over@@ sized signature underneath ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is endow@@ ed with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show , by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a side of the com@@ ic nov@@ ella mentioned above .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she emerges from the discipline of discipline of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they stick to your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ utes Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res which rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which her genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a nation @-@ wide human ch@@ ase is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an Oxford university staff looking for susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as demonstrated by the acts of the District Court of Cook County .
the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several years .
a joint warning system published by the Chicago police department states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
officials got a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the scene , and det@@ ec@@ tives examine the en@@ grav@@ ings as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
she has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ garbage , vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them should now be in a lau@@ de and be excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ garbage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker from the university and Somer@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every possible way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shock@@ ed and wanted it to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he insist@@ ently urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who just received a mysterious tip that said something had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred also on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that ladies and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
the management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re@@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren in the Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has acknowledged an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not give anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
talking to Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v answered problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia during dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA Executive Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
the company groups shared this with them .
it was a pure precau@@ tion that could no longer be assumed for any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the communication .
from now on only eggs to Al@@ di are likely to be supplied , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ey @-@ containing anti @-@ lice .

start @-@ ups that will help your business not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ ep@@ tive .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she called for help from the outside .
a new Human Resources start @-@ ups race is wa@@ xing to help businesses find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low cons@@ enting results - so you can re@@ bo@@ ort why .
companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the Finance Technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent can send customised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that enables employees to report bad behavior .
and when the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion court has recorded the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company operates Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by managers sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair inter@@ ns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es &apos; Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen crashed due to ethical infrin@@ gements by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured themselves $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of enterprises , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets like Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that their voices heard and that the work you do is worth it , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ tes when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
indeed , if a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough or not at all , dis@@ appointment can grow and employees can demo@@ tiv@@ ate .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm of Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t follow colleagues , ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets new insights into employees , and it hopes that in the long run this will lead to a better bond between employees in a sector known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it goes to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ se on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey sections and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who have joined the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour practice before they return to the water man football center the next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ x@@ trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday for Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A will eliminate two @-@ day exercises to ease the player &apos;s load , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three courses of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the brothers postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as they performed six hours of play in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold up 18 exercises during August . 20 before the beginning of the formal preparations for their opening against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s control change even if it adds another point to the player &apos;s busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ated on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is due to the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been jet@@ ti@@ son@@ ed with foot@@ balls , which will have a protective net behind a gate post , will not be an easy task .
bru@@ din players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set out to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ si@@ fications to fake reviews from third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to detect potential false al@@ erts and send them to factor checks that may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of whom believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories prior to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan for social media networks to be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts check was launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories are challenged by fac@@ tual reviews of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
author of a novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy Se@@ at River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cos@@ mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dil@@ ection for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ olic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac drow@@ sin@@ wi@@ cz , British May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : in 2014 he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
and the letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the site and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape fle@@ as , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust first received full access in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the cler@@ ks just began to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats spoke &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ i@@ ries , maps showing who owned something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader base , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revol@@ t of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , whom the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century portra@@ yed his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed quite rest@@ less to always pay debts and spend money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them to be a bunch of good @-@ looking boys , with a talent for recru@@ iting land@@ marks . &quot;
after the end of his essay in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ lä@@ ß@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium of the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle clo@@ aked in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the closure of the 301 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz &apos;s logo and slogan secretly .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too good for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf church yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wrote on their yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that as a bad Honne@@ f we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they compete with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f will cost an average five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Chief Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the chair@@ manship of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the head of government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions .
as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number of survivors .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
while the Chief of Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remained in office , the officers of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len exile worker , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a pioneer of coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan commanded the attempted coup as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan actually have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the paper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article with the head@@ line of &quot; Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the head@@ set ban on female soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the big pur@@ ges with the army and the security forces continue in any case .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan commanded by decree a further 7@@ 3@@ 95 govern@@ ors , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered the actual masters of the country .
three times they played their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan th@@ ron@@ ged the power of the military step by step , not least of his appeal to the European Union &apos;s reform objectives .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan drives targeted an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer who sought asylum in foreign countries after the coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; in just a few years .
if this happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , in the alliance , after the pur@@ ges , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington alters the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
it envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by changing the way citizens are spent from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry plans to rehabil@@ itate track for platform shuttle
over the past few months over the future of the race ticket sh@@ utt@@ les has been denied again and again - now it is supposed to go very fast .
even before the end of the year , it is supposed to be built on the shortest route on which the tourist train runs .
in order to secure the future of the programme utt@@ les in the long term , construction works are to begin in the course of construction work this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and san@@ i@@ tise the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country comm@@ its itself to this important connection , especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Secretary of State , Klaus Wo@@ l , on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he estimated the costs for the maintenance of the circuit to about € 2.5 million .
of this sum , the country receives 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared expi@@ ation .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia railway as an operator have already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
in order to make sure that the racing @-@ bad@@ ger @-@ Shuttle will be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the speed@@ rope @-@ shuttle is a railway connection between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g , especially for tourists .
in the past few months , a pilot operation has been carried out to determine whether the track is being used by many people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also very steep in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it could not be crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( Foundation for responsible Robo@@ tics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of finger nail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we &apos;ll get them much more common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; adapt &quot; his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it becomes more wor@@ rying , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that a step@@ mother woman would look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have become robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed characters such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality that suits your personality as good as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses true Compan@@ ion &apos;s website .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day it also has its mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , alarm the most .
on his website true companion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men naturally do not have sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notic@@ ing their increasing popularity , they remain tent@@ atively on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what escap@@ es from the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or offensive , until the free market gives them permission to do so .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most deter@@ rent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the ma@@ iden &apos; ) is not the graphical images , the swal@@ lowed body and the st@@ oned eyes , but how realistic this vision acts .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as possible technically possible ( although with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they can &apos;t separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words : they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to put it in the Spe@@ ech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ wisdom of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized U.S. elec@@ torate have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we all ost@@ ensi@@ bly ex@@ ert ourselves to burst our filter bags .
less notice has been the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring families together .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tish poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she fought for decades because of politics suddenly and completely stran@@ gely on the same side .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is in another context that this also involves considerable risks .
the left has been strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the striking effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speaking of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will not be exp@@ elled one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards .
I find myself falling from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ ic version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both of which appear to be very mild off@@ ences compared to Tr@@ ump .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York park &apos;s car@@ ou@@ sels , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the per@@ spir@@ ing music im@@ parts this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Them@@ es @-@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a curi@@ ously magical experience , since here two @-@ year @-@ olds , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40@@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ essively bur@@ den@@ some while I tired of the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts at his hand@@ w@@ ri@@ sts , which he , according to the prison authorities , suffered from a fall in his cell .
after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , pouring it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he was his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ el , of which they say that she is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National prosecution authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the schools in Blum@@ berg , the districts of F@@ uses and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the school holidays and secondary schools .
three of the students are going to school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , elected a young eagle in the chicken farm , but then released to freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the cheerful crowd led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Adler in the chicken farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and had it f@@ rat@@ ched from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chi@@ ckens cage , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him was broken ; the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ cks carrying cylinders to the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schul@@ te An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished each four @-@ door dispens@@ er to feel accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a word of thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who repeatedly came up with instruc@@ tional pas@@ sports and the parent @-@ representatives .
the time now is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher explained .
she was reluc@@ tant to leave her students after two years of learning because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door dispens@@ er .
at the end , all students let a song of summer time and holiday time be heard .
great joy broke out with the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , par@@ ted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , refer@@ enced by television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally tents was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is currently underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place considerable fin@@ es on everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the Court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission characteristics of cars from emissions categories Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europe offers assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates that are negotiated are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fit has been ordered by the Federal Chanc@@ ellery of Germany ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler has announced to write to each affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be settled within the scope of this inspection .
how long should the conver@@ sions take over altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this will depend on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , car manufacturers do not act voluntarily in the topic environment up to now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW company ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
presum@@ ably , foreign manufacturers would follow , says S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now thre@@ aten ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
up to now , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait with a sale .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This pres@@ idency has decided to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights completely - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make her view clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .

we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re in the coming year .
the job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker City Engineer since 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , he is surprised that no application has so far fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this should be enough time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation , taking into account the regular notice of notice .
since Has@@ lach works as a Lower Building Law Authority for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant has to present appropriate degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they were no longer able to fill them in , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but clos@@ eness to citizens is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in ministry , some important projects have accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city li@@ vable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a area and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz , for example , have been initiated .
the zig @-@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will book with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
for a city building master there is great scope for design .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted flexibly to much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble is listed as a historic monument , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what it fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the out@@ going urban Builder .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister already has a high level of responsibility .
he is the client , &quot; everything is going through my table at the end . &quot;
in terms of support and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain in place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
according to information from the town of Has@@ lach , those who wish to inherit Roland W@@ acker should have a degree in architecture or Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of construction planning and construction planning law .
the Municipal Building Department includes civil engineering and civil engineering , construction supervision , urban property management , urban landsc@@ aping , building yard and urban gardening as well as under civil protection authority including monument protection .
bike thrown on lines : southern run@@ way blocked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bike onto the lines from the railway crossing in the area of the Le@@ oben Road ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night hours .
close to the crime scene a pink sco@@ oter and a bike rider were watched by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a diversity of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he or the perpet@@ rators brought themselves into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the equipment as well as the delay and the costs for rail transport , P@@ ön@@ alen of the railway @-@ customers could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , there was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum to go out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the Southern Railway Line could be led without disabilities .
there were barely ten passenger flights depar@@ ting Friday morning , two of them were watching the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall out , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those concerned are usually advised to ste@@ er meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the equilibrium dec@@ lines too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it was found that a type of tolerance supporting immune cells occurs in mice carrying a particular bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system works also among humans .
the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was accommod@@ ated separately , had not .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial activity of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and there were found six species of bacteria present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them in the mice lacking .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they got the L. Cross and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as the i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice feeds , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho thinks Manchester United has a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid ki@@ cks off on Tuesday , and impressed in the keeper &apos;s role , when people like Paul Pog@@ gi@@ u and Andreas Per@@ eira were mar@@ ching at will .
matic , however , had been excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before starting the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho came up with his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted another three new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority commitments .
&quot; three of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing Pi@@ ec@@ es &quot; Dream@@ liner in the Sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off at Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and retired in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which is several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be on the radar screens .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister had always looked for Berlin before elections .
bare @-@ hear@@ ted cross@@ fire from the party centre , merely no head@@ wind from the League - was the most important wish of the election comb@@ at@@ ants .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watch out with increasing horror the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were deep stops .
one by one .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern confi@@ dently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Green party has thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the election of the Parliament , the red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on El@@ ke T@@ westen lower Sax@@ on Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ westen to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
El@@ ke T@@ westen must return her mandate immediately , &quot; said the German Federal President and election campaign leader of the Gre@@ ens to the German editorial team ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without his own government majority after the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen
it is the provisional highlight of a series of large and small crises in the state of the SPD .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly marked defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , was comfor@@ ted by the comrades at the time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that became - and indeed everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to w@@ ander , the Düsseldorf bank@@ rupt@@ cy ble@@ w the party smooth .
the comrades exhausted himself again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next draft .
mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in the crisis communication he made pretty much everything wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz fought for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for a long time because of the VW exhaust gas and its role on the Supervisory Board .
mi@@ ogen@@ ated survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for this reason , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation in the past weeks .
the aim of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin has not been hidden by comrades in the field of Martin Schulz .
they allowed him to grant him a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party internal force of the Gre@@ ens of Lower Saxony .
and Schulz even not at all .
at the same time , comrades , comrades , try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ westen
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen combined her own car@@ eers at the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party lef@@ tist in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial team ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen is not elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but by the country list of the Lower Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in Parliament , so the Lower Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties continue .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; the vote of voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; says Grand@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate for the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demanded clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or given further commitments of the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding for Res@@ ident Star III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative St@@ eg Urban Development informed them in sens@@ ations on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information session Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what has happened so far .
since 1991 I have been in sensi@@ ti@@ sing areas of rehabilitation .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg adopted two thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development , not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , the government pres@@ i@@ dium , Karlsruhe , received the information that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the sum total amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 euro came from the country , the rest of the community sensi@@ bilities .
how is a rehabilitation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will further investigate , as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is any interest in rehabil@@ it@@ ating .
if necessary , the area borders may be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening , the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Federal @-@ Land programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and extending the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out obj@@ ectively , that is per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute .
the licence period for the funding has been ongoing since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
until September this year , however , the survey would only be carried out , within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional decision should be carried out as soon as possible so that the renovation can begin next year .
then Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that every commun@@ e must carry out the aforementioned preventive examinations .
the aim is to evaluate the urban ab@@ norm@@ alities and decide when to be renovated and to what extent .
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back to the senses and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ tw@@ ald emphasized that the project was a key success factor for the project .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Property Sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with which it works , among other things , the structural condition and the renovation intentions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing Sector , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents of a residential space can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new building measures are not eligible for funding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler pointed out that the distribution of the subsidies according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was working - those who come first gr@@ ind first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t afford to make money for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to move in house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a Consul@@ tant An@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ sten at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedures are performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro @-@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks at houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one now has installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that raises the American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military data left to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter produced in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was on display next to a Ma@@ ine yacht , a Wisconsin fire truck and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forklift truck .
the White House Military Bureau required the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy commander of the Navy .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3@@ pm , and so long stayed until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 that evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original aircraft crew was during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
it was not clear from the records provided by TI@@ ME , whether a second flight crew was finally required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the appointment .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the command@@ ant wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as the official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate and propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ op is unusual .
Tr@@ ump issued an investigation in February when the presidential jet served in the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compl@@ ying about the use of the presidential jet through its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Assistant Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area in order to offset the US president in the White House with precise cen@@ timeter kits .
as Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted for the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters flew an additional 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took over the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget@@ ary drawings for the presidential pl@@ ou@@ ghs , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3@@ d is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for the rates of ref@@ unds is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter while he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire bri@@ g@@ ade car .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V mainly imports from the high north provide .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us as ever . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could be Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man who is currently playing the Chall@@ enger event in the Italian bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man does not succeed in the Bundes@@ li@@ ga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing in the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament will be his first bet in this season .

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really be happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday night under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the congress wrote a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow , too , was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels opposed the US kick @-@ off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that will help Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the O@@ MV are concerned , who co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea resort North Stream 2 together with other European companies .
the threat of the threat is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .

roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city nur@@ series the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld will reg@@ ain the food supply in the urban kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , deputy head of the youth welfare sector , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked will continue to be out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh g@@ ums chill@@ ed .
in Kre@@ feld , the city operates 46 nur@@ series , in 44 children receive a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past kit@@ ten year 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ days in the day@@ time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 2 : 00@@ pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees have kitchen service from September 1 : they warm up the delivered food , add salad , raw vegetables and fruits , divide the meal individually , give the meal , clean up , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a ch@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ania .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven units - decide about the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also about healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen workers - is done by special cleaning staff in the future .
besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , this variant - apart from the quality improvement of the kitchen performance - has also the charm that it turned out to be the most economical in comparison to the cost comparison of the city .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are newly hired .
&quot; but these hours are not so strong for about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz .
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting director of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be in the provinces during the Council elections . three women candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate un@@ reserv@@ edly and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Tali@@ ban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the elections for the first time will hand over the power to the next democr@@ atically elected government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million registered voters .

men are trying to exter@@ min@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 must have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
according to the information of the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who kept up with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ strasse , at 2 : 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request but continued with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpet@@ rators then tried to grab the cell phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , failed .
the duo escaped without prey .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie Factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow at managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits alongside other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ zier &apos;s owner , Pla@@ di , said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company head of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; expressing concern that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity on the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross from the General Site Manager concerns our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers are strongly focused on local community and large @-@ scale Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of work@@ places , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly because we value the ongoing commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with our employees that like all companies active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment , we continually review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross country , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production completely and completely . if our operational processes change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the site of La League may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not indul@@ ge in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar after giving up an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the record of the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous stamp , with Paul Pog@@ gi@@ va returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and become the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about how N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source close to the Catal@@ ans stance is that the club has always given its best to take care of him since San@@ tos was coming from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President in front of this prospect ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for every club who wanted to subscribe to one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona felt the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price deals for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope Jean @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope Jean @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement , &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication in relation to the German press agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the cathedral @-@ chapel master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ved Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would greatly serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were measured when reporting on violence in the cathedral spar@@ rows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that should be punished and prevented in the future , but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of nam@@ ing the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is part of everyday experience and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ af@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and that is a bound fres@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hits were a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get ready with dar@@ ing children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in connection with reports about the mis@@ use cases , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the souvenir sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report published by Mr. Ulrich Weber , commissioned by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 67 cathedral @-@ spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is said to be Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality the punishment for the students could be even more violent .
in contrast to numerous other def@@ end@@ ants , however , many of the victims inv@@ oked the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even have positive memories associated with him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal is reli@@ eved of his opinion on the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atz Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violent exercise of protection ordered by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it appears to be ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ cian and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible when a cathedral spar@@ row did not bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complic@@ ity or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside his sphere of influence .
it is possible to reproach it at best , to experience it too late , or to have taken first hints not seriously enough .
the domain gymn@@ asi@@ um on which he worked was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent certificate , describes it as &quot; warm hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who supplied the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which has already led to rage erup@@ tions .
the fact that he did not only kno@@ ck on the ground with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also gave ear @-@ cow@@ ards and moved too che@@ ek@@ y guys to the hair or ears , he already admitted many years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such education methods were widespread in the period in question , in the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , this is certainly Bag@@ at@@ ella .
one wonders whether it has to do with his famili@@ arity and role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI that many media have just rus@@ hed upon him .
on the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report , a report on the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was reported in the media .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger engaged in the final report any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted themselves to the domin@@ ator .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man for the other , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even confi@@ de in parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader who , in a professional sense , would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had early knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I consider it ... also for really absurd , to assume that it was calcul@@ ating him ... Bu@@ ben intru@@ sive or clearer or even more open than their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that affected students and / or their surroundings trusted him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted by any fellow @-@ man .
therefore he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to an advertisement .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these vile crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Way@@ showers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed up and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and exc@@ esses and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is , in turn , an abuse of the report .
it is separated clean@@ ly : between the pre @-@ school and the secondary school of the cathedral @-@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and exc@@ esses of violence and , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the cathedral spar@@ rows .
the whole horri@@ ble test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally har@@ assed and mal@@ ol@@ ated and suffered terri@@ bly , all took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already on the domain gymn@@ asi@@ um .
on the one hand , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the theme of &quot; primary school &quot; is tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; conditions .
what was different on the grammar school gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael hes@@ it@@ emann : there was discipline , but there was no voice of sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in whom the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many cas@@ u@@ alties are the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories are connected with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have taken away .
however , in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently closed the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the grammar school gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed in the pre @-@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as testing fin@@ es were banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected people might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
that simply isn &apos;t true .
it was only in 1980 that the punishment of schools in Bavaria was officially aboli@@ shed .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis stated that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , the danger of ass@@ essing the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is already right .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that then .
that &apos;s all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked up .
but at the same time I have to take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , that is , sla@@ p of the ear and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was forbidden , he was strictly bound by it .
what image of his Regensburg time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger give back to you in the discussions with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope ? &quot;
was the subject audi@@ bility also a language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI . , tells from his perspective , that the dom@@ es only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not at all mean that he had a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world @-@ tran@@ g institution , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys don &apos;t even make a big singer and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic @-@ good , deep faith and heart @-@ good people , of which one cannot imagine that he could do something even for a fly .
I regularly get in touch with him , like many former dom@@ ain@@ es still today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ dence , regularly keep in touch with him , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral spar@@ rows are grateful to him today for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them to the world of music .
and that he always was a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but it was also a lovely respect@@ ful person to which they still look up and who almost rever@@ e them .
and please , once more clearly : all you reproach is the methods of education that were the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have long over@@ came this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a media sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him .
now the start @-@ up would stop , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without which nobody outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to leave in peace .
