<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren Institution, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn-tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys if maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, which had to be exciting, because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up to date - but very insightful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a FlickenteppI, which one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Detailed maps, so-called documentary sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian Palace Department between 1810 and 1864 and originate from Bavaria's first surveying.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally removed the peace from Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was the neighbours of today who created the idea of a regional map of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV pointed out the project further, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and therewith the Bavarian Palace Department." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The original data sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found like any other on the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is most impressive on the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the creation of the map, Sendling was founded in 1877 as part of the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered tracks from the so-called "original recording" from which the land tax was deduced.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, small plots have no more farmers - they are small farmers in the "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is marked north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or from the height" "" "On the air" "" "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, people once locked up people with insanity.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based" "" "Kreis-Irrenanstalt" "" "was born on the Auer Lübeck." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden commenced the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the misfortune of the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also forbids the personnel to use violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the prison.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients had first place, later on 500 places were expanded.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreiserrenanstalt in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum meet at the site of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it to a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of TSV München East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural harmony with the original building of the Irrennet, which had been destroyed during the Second World War during bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main place" "" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allies bomb planted a lot of holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel dating from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-up line will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warnings for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, requires afro-american travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, and to be noted here," says the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to accuse discrimination, as well as the state's law enforcement authorities, which are disproportionate towards minorities, prompted the group to release the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be stopped because of their skin color, they will be beaten or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited events such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in doubtful circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline while traveling through the state and was put in custody by the Missouri police without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report of the Missouri General Prosecutor's Office in which black motorists in the state are recruited 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Mays.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring money or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 according to the latest figures from the hate crime report program of the FBI, which classify the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of discrimination of housing or employment.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had passed immigration laws that bind local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to the further racial benefit according to ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">The Weidezvous Project is Elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weichenaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac presented a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU village association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met in the court yard of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young animals supplied and accommodated in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is for him the alternative marketing trail for the milk of his cows," "" "Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also the president of Fisherman's LHV, he described the Weidezvous project as" "" "essential" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot manage to farm on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area care for a lot of work, much has to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not lead a bio operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the Weidezvaun project and is pleased with the leaders" "" "leader." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to carry on their business," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced up by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of the open area is 40 hectares, which are not allowed until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half was promoted by leader of the total cost of 71 500 euros, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers left 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," says Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job without farmers and landwomen."</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiß: "here we produce the best food."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Framework Directive (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg allows state funding of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.</seg>
<seg id="93">The requirement is the presence of a conveying system described by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the area to be enforced must not be passable (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "for the" "" "Fischbacher Weirestraining Project" "", "the application of eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build up almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of disclosure is 35 hectares and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fira Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals for drastic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty agitators would have shrieked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attaches importance to it, and in particular the meaning attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta stated, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem I refer to, later added, and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who longs to breathe freely, / the miserable litter of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic visual representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she has a very different name: mother of Exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservatism who puts the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not light the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black Celebrates Scottish Members of the UK Team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "her captain's speech was incredible," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in her fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">"" "the" "" "middle-runner" "" "Muir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year." ""</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5.000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season, which included victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman was in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that it is "hugely proud" to the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me makes it a special thing for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes, who want to climb on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the voter heating up</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He dabbled in criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783 Washington said," "" "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">Therefore the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it's a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very clever in using Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to defile his hair-free head for chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse advocated the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who vibrate the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to the Catholic faith in Hogans.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," "" "she wrote in the Comments section of the" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't really appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stance on the same issue, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the governors referred to as a" "" "concentrated spam-attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical corpses or to arrest demonstrators and silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what is happening digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County wrote the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters fell on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belizarius" and "Portius," wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticized his position on the amity contract, trade and shipping with Britain, overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence her.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation.</seg>

<seg id="273">In addition, Papua has wood resources worth around $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="274">These riches are, however, a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military has preserved a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">A study conducted in the New York Times in 2005 reported that Freeport paid close to $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 in a single officer.</seg>

<seg id="349">Some of the top-OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yuden Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to this, thousands of people were arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily taken into custody, under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>

<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 Cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">In the course of time economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nabire.</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and well-educated migrants.</seg>

<seg id="365">In addition, restrictions on reporting international media remain tense.</seg>
<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudas and Basille Longchamp were deported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although the rare permission for filming was given to them.</seg>

<seg id="370">In March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua including the Paniai firing.</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 per cent said they were late to discover that they had gone miserably with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey of more than 1,000 people, carried out by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers rather disregard the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">From those surveyed who agreed that they knowingly tried to fly with something forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 percent millennials were compared to less than 15 percent, who were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent admit to have knowingly carried articles with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of female surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male surveyed also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the plane.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said there were travellers all over the country to find out how many inadvertently brought smuggled goods by airport security and how many had intentionally done it.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that people who have the most smuggled ware - knowingly or unknowingly - carry through security, those who fly the most frequent.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electric-Tausendsassa Elon Musk enjoys the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">He has so far failed to make sure that some of the customers have already retired their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed another less brilliant figure when announcing the latest quarterly balance: that of the cancellations for the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk has frequently had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car whose delivery has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: 63.000 retreats have already been withdrawn from the 518,000 pre-orders.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have always pointed out that they are only non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 US Dollar and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "reservation payment" completely.</seg>
<seg id="428">Currently 45,000 of such non-binding reservations have been submitted, musk in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">By 2018, all models will be together - 500,000, 2020 one million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obviously there.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to musk, 1800 reservations are made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand new production lines tested never before in practice with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">However, if there are major delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="441">Pruit presented the change as its agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is about a deadline which expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-to-earth ozone." ""</seg>
<seg id="444">Prudent announced in June that he will delay the observance of one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering with local decisions or to impede economic growth. "</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was President Donald Trump Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of severe environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations which resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the most recent legal setback for the Prupeas regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Employment Tribunal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Prude proposed that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "in previous administrations, the EPO often failed to meet deadlines for execution and then waited to be prosecuted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement setting the date for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who sued the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the Ozone rules.</seg>

<seg id="457">According to the New York Public Prosecutor, Eric Schneiderman, who presided over the coalition of States that the EPA issued during this week, the group deliberated to maintain legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday 16th July at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in town have made the friends and sponsors tumultuous their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 St. Hilariusenelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg Urcustomer's book: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">In addition to the former parish church, the wording of the document, besides the former parish church, was also a marvelous farm belonging to the church or the patronage right and not the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As you can see from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the townscape of Tumlingen today, the "Berg" is the third, the village's beautiful settlement centre.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 underpin these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated from the early medieval self-Church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This entailed the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The elder of the two barbared on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang out for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796, French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out pulpit and church mill and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumour Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from radio-brokers.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower could be left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year night in 1834 a storm split the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower existing today remained as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem cultivate the Hilarius system as successors to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organisers invite the friends and sponsors tumlins on Sunday, 16th July, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilariusenelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">The suburb of Hartmut Romann talks about the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30.</seg>
<seg id="499">For the end of the Serenade a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," "" "the organizers provide the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius complex, which is of importance for tumors and listeners.</seg>

<seg id="504">Association intends to review wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"Boisheim weeps itself" does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.</seg>
<seg id="506">The Boisheim club has called on "Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim region.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen there existed only a wind power-concentration zone at the boundary of Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent "asparagus" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days earlier, the city Viersen had decided to change the land use plan a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but it did not approve the district government of Düsseldorf because of a fault.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning permission, the approved approval decision is still illegal and therefore also reluctant," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" Boisheim. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break the city council renewed the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a approval by the district government is still pending.</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle takes them as an occasion to examine the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">Looking at the proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argumentation of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans the construction of four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim river.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city Viersen participates indirectly, signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large area.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households will be covered - this equates to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-person households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Kreis Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="682">They work in several places in their volunteer year.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I will help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at the school in the open day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">A lot: it's a nice wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a late-called volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come from?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I graduated from school.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineer studies, we say, successfully broken off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I recognized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something different with people working.</seg>

<seg id="695">Do a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on site, at the focal point, maybe, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it so?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study a dual, probably in Jugendamt Herne, do a social worker education and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.</seg>

<seg id="702">It probably always depends on where you are going to be FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">It can be made from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">It was very varied with me.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon supervision.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes down.</seg>
<seg id="708">Different from studying civil engineering?</seg>
<seg id="709">A lot: well, here it's not about calculating Statiks.</seg>
<seg id="710">You always have other people upside down, each having a whole different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a youth, has been taken out of the family - you have to deal with it individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you didn't have any reservations?</seg>
<seg id="714">A lot: I'm not the guy for that.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>

<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the council veers in front of seeing such a common room not as a meeting place just for the residents of the seniorous dwelling but openly into the community.</seg>

<seg id="760">Needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer does not mean this addition.</seg>

<seg id="766">This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area there is no subsidy, but a real countervalue which is marketable in the case of doubt, is the counter-speech.</seg>
<seg id="767">For Stageers's request to choose the proposed resolution, there are three proponents.</seg>

<seg id="908">The building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, crosses the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete, clad with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges cross the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are built from red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively, 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the north side has now received a 1,30 metre wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fastener, which is also used as a mode of operation.</seg>
<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge a 2,20 metre wide bridge is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to go.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that it is finished parts, a patent by the Schramberger Company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">In the run-up to the work, local residents were informed of the project by handouts.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champion league tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEFA means that PSG has to prove that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians out of their contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team due to the rich host family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but they must interact with legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to break the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively dulled and risked to ruin when banks or owners relocated their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP moved from concentration to clubs debt to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich in 2003 in Chelsea has bought a club with potential and invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder business.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"" "" "" "during the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros." ""</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the Presidency in 2015, the UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to discourage excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catalytic company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring was to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the PSA's sponsorship was backed up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar WM will be ambassador and that such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The current sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">Last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year need to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after signature will rise by at least 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent Neymars move by claiming that PSG would breach the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year Grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Show alter the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like the time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for a speaking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By dividing to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - nevertheless they managed to regain the impossibility of regaining the last part of the wit.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with its adults, who are now playing adult, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character clashes with an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things dating back to 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now romance writer, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy vicious plot which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-written impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">"" "it's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's underlippenbart of" "" "Singles" "", "whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker." ""</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random madness that could preheat this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band how they will visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War of Americans, to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East versus West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues are dubbed by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent play 'Find out the Voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"comrade Detective," which was edited on a lower length could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef continue to visit the American embassy, whose lobbying lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a forage for a banquet.</seg>

<seg id="1210">Strike against drug mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police managed to beat the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">In doing so, 15 accused persons were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the officials saw large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as hundreds of thousands of euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">In the time of the same raids in Italy two persons were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German warrants against the two suspects Italians.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore presumably delivered to Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living a big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, grew out of a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack her bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one bedroom estate with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "that was my requirement," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is rather complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of one another without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">A classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area for the mezzanine.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Moule lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went into it," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is opposite, so that when you push the door, it moves very smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and elevated square footage of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers reside four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynasty, in a dispute over one of the largest real estate empire in Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be split.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - von Paul described as "main operator and the dominating personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">"" "" "" "a court record says that this means that Colin owns $316 million worth of USD $176 million." ""</seg>
<seg id="1365">The breakdown of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "those proposed by Colin have left him with what I considered the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says, he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs arise in the case with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessens from the late 1950 "s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970's.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to disclose her property to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claims that Mark has paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Luke and Mark are, according to Paul, "bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin was very restrained even though he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin responded by SMS to say" "" "I really can't say much," "" "because the case was before the courts." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the presidency's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more smooth course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive staff on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repay: bad information that fell into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by overseeing his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," "" "said the former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps' s Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, insists that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know from others - that trumps tweets could have contained even more combustibles without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets which Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff made it a few times to keep annoyance from him, then their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to bring forward their own agenda by presenting Trump materials that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO, busy with this story, reported in May about the fondness of advisors to provide doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump-officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he tries to figure out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone viciously accused the President of a printed copy of an article by Gotnew.com, the web site of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "being the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to chicans or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has rejected false accusations in the past and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began to question people about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof, Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on the 1st of March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Birkenhof through the former ambience operating company ltd. on April 13, 2014, about 30,000 qualifying stays per year were lost and revenues were also paid by the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered to the district office as a shelter, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and already spoke to the house by serious potential customers.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group of Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabers, purchased the former Birkenhof at a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to return it to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabera and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You name Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former hotel Birkenhof, construction shuttling containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when entering the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still a lot to do by March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">Everything should later be "pretty civic" as Thomas Scherer says.</seg>
<seg id="1466">"" "" "" "we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1468">It is not desirable to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, Scherer appreciates.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">When it comes to investments, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to pinpoint exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Less than a million euros, he expects.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The outer complexes are also brought forward to the front, which is already clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard there is a large terrace that is accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: United States Special Issuer sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special issuer Robert Mueller has set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the committee has resumed its work in recent weeks," "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "wrote in appeal to people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper described the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN transmitter reported that there are already initial invitations from the committee in connection with a meeting between the Trumps eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for some time being targeted at the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller studied whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigation, several men are to stand, who acted as advisers of the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took a close look at more and more drumps in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote that the special agent Trump had personally moved into the centre and accused the accusation that the President may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurists is to check present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to prosecute charges.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called anchor clips.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always done behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The committee may also be turned on by the public prosecutor's office in order to invite persons to interrogate under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN transmitter, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. there were also Trumps Advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign chief Paul Manafort during the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the suspension showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">It must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "nevertheless, the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new ground for concern for President Trump." ""</seg>

<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the issue gives the democrats an opportunity to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special intercessor in" "" "fair" "" "mode." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief, James Comey, said three times that it was not determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the Declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was first used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this rooting, reproaches against Trump have become loud, he wanted to obstruct the judiciary." ""</seg>

<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House gathered material against the special issuer and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller would release.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the Western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has been solved by the scarce seven-fold size of Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was confirmed by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The giant colossus, weighing over a trillion ton and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it melted.</seg>

<seg id="1524">According to research information, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">Overall, however, for around 30 years there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now aborted colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C Schelfeis.</seg>

<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelvio is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">At the north of this bowl, the balance between waxing and breaking off was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete Schelvio there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen C Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never been as far withdrawn as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of ice horseshoe and iceberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the bell cheese causes the glaciers to flow straight into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly raise sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C Schelvio is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the record," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Scientists have argued whether the Larsen C Schelfeis will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lead to the departure of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many of the polar treasures of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic is stretching towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research programme of the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and tames it to the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls on the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, the working day had a 41 new job in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 clerks and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have completed their first day of work.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers at the circle are apparently very much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications had been filed for the places to be published this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At the moment, there are still 50 vacant positions in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things doctors and engineers and forces of general administration are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Together with the FDP and the UWG, the CDU wants to take the initiative together with the UWG and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "the administration is to develop a concept for recruiting personnel and personnel development at the request of the parties." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of skilled workers, but to counteract forward-looking application scarcity, it is said.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate both internally and externally, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training campaign, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a real" "" "competition of public employers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a large number of employees who leave the ministry due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So it is high time for action so that not even more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, Group leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He took care of a lazy surprise early on in the working day, when he publicly challenged human resources coverage and startled the remaining parties.</seg>

<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we fail to find a satisfactory solution here at short notice, the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a hourly tariff," "" "states people." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU seeks to pay better for employees and officials than is actually envisaged by the public service tariff.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are prescribed exactly at the moment, increases or more money is only available if one changes to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago new premises had to be established, in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat to the German charity 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has been in operation only a year ago, refused to comment on detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment," the organization said in a statement on the social media.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations that are currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which are delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can shut off so that ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of being overseen by the authority of the Italian Coastguard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa, above all, must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations have now agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1594">In the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome bonus.</seg>

<seg id="1604">In between there were again and again longer ascents, for the long Trials reward.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk fest sausage market.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Are sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium race?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long since become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with heavy weights included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">The first Bundesliga societies have also recognized this, which are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, followed by the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1630">But is it really a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Froboso dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show lots of biological and physical reactions, which are also found in classic sports - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist he proposed himself among other things as a signatory for greetings cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once.</seg>
<seg id="1783">Following stations in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came into being at the end of the 60's: with the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match, and then in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is retrograde due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect-borne insects, which causes great headaches for scientists and farmers who try to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert in the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered as the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cicaade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and there are many of them in very dry weather. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not only tempting for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaissa said: "instead of having very long vegetable clocks with a large number of flowers we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with ethereal oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">Assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep though his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hung on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although an Attorney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only introduced two criminal proceedings pursuant to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely indicted.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why we are mistrust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left behind a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing to silence about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans' arrest last year and the surrender to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot on the street every day, or that the graveyard is full of embellished two-storeyed mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a cartel has the control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gays bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar equity holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the drug poison issue," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising grew.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved being able to publish rigorous investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for the courage to prosecute the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was cursing like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was His love for routine destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret runways," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the trouble is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing has happened to Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days before, it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in a joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself regarded as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">"" "" "" "it's months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto control." ""</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has looked at three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxer, Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to government spending, concentrating on the Governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group sitting in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, conducting a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the entire century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before, readers would have looked at the readers of Valdez as the best informed sources of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" for his slender body fitting.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers against murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"" "in the whole country, journalists have become phonetic by writing down in organized protests" "" "SOS Press" "" "on sidewalks and constructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice system in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and letting them kill because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since been asked to be reorganized by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials involved and an equivalent society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who put under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Its incredibly well-preserved condition has baffled researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of place by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy earthy clumps.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinking a little with your eyes, you might almost believe it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that these herbivores, although covered with armor and resemble a changing tank, probably have been threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique that is known as counter shading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and dodge its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours studying it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing maintenance of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by eating meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution furthered the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the shadowage - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predatory behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores must have been the crayon time," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to study the animal on information about his life, including his preserved presentation content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sunk on the back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved skin, but retains its original shape and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early chalk time." ""</seg>

<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-preserved dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from muzzle to hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant-eaters were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cover of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the house branches are still covering wooden plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tests "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or you are immersed in his work and just have a brilliant thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffer.</seg>

<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing automatic ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to validate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">A test operation is currently running on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"" "" "" "if the offer arrives, we extend it." ""</seg>

<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use them, however, some requirements need to be met: a smartphone or tablet needs to be met.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to be purchased via the App of the railway, which is the DB navigator, which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"" "because the" "" "Comfort check-in" "" "works like this: you get into the train, call his ticket under" "" "My Tickets" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for electronic validation appears with the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the train attendant arrives at place Y at the ticket inspection, he knows there is a passenger sitting there with an already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep quiet.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn should be used by passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel without a ticket inspection by our train crew will simply check in in the DB Navigator.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This allows passengers to make their journey more personal in the train, "says Michael Peterson, DB TV marketing executive.</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "second Plus:" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you don't have all the documents you need to validate online tickets in any case, but one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents required.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or ID card or otherwise a document you have to present.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to poor tuning in the compartment or large space and delays in checking your own tickets and taking the conductor in the end time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that applies only to the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a mail from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18 year old child and it is still on the street," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused as no one else posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweed at her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and left there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "Ferrell thought with himself." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and to their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone off to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photographs of the police band and people crying out, and of a man who claimed to be Browns's father who wore a shield with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed in which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, another policeman said his gun and cried," "" "I will kill you... animals all." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "I was angry and wept." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11 o'clock, she fetched her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11th.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, which consists of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower-dress and a suitable crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation which they had innumerable times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18 year old boy and that wasn't right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I couldn't take her away, "Ferrell said later.</seg>

<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up therein.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to get free to liberate ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have the luck to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women-child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would do it a bad service to keep them away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police force that became a camp area when the activists were awaiting the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed totally after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "everything has come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came from Ferrell:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview, "We have heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already cooperated with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement made Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other natives, followed by the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "this documentary isn't someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we're talking," "" "Davis said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as these people are represented, for so I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferris's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin, in 2012 saw the film "BlackLivesMatter," in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black gay women must carry the brunt of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not a affirmative type of action" "", "which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook her energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime the telecommunication cameras in Ferguson have disappeared long ago, but the racial connections between the township and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"" "she describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home:" "" "chaos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she clings to a singing and she feels bound to this memory since she went to Ferguson three years ago.</seg>

<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The subject hardly leaves cold.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the proponents build a gallery to attract more customers to the city, and the other businesses also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the plot in which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction work will be finished.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is at the top of the price.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies, as the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmers market hall go down during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes along.</seg>

<seg id="2122">But thanks to the incredibly many - as I think - meaningless building projects in Bitburg don't give a place for a farmer's market hall.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A fitting resemblance: artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which almost resemble themselves - hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuckern and Haaretz, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year sentence after making public diplomacy about WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transsinger and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg, through algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, a sharp, though some intellectual comment not only to the forms of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but had already talked openly about identification as a woman since she puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the law of espionage, computer scams and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison their image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just about the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became unequal briphews, which over the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a Comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the president would formulate Overseas judgement and would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually calling Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome sort of happy gathering.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid splits that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a particular reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is endowed with a heart) an end to "automatic fragmentation," whose foundation was gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show, by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a side of the comic novella mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she emerges from the discipline of discipline of the United States like King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulacres which rally like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees in your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called for help from the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources start-ups race is waxing to help businesses find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, provide special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low consenting results - so you can reboort why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture, so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Finance Technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Cent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"" "like Glint, Convercent can send customised" "" "Puls-" "" "surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that enables employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the public opinion court has recorded the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company operates Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by managers sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair interns.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>

<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees' Commitment in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen crashed due to ethical infringements by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right," that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Cent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising all capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured themselves $10 million in November by Bessemer's Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of enterprises, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that their voices heard and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendites when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, if a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough or not at all, disappointment can grow and employees can demotivate.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm of Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "if you don't follow colleagues, ask yourself," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run this will lead to a better bond between employees in a sector known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy Seat River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a predilection for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: in 2014 he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I only reacted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," "" "he says." ""</seg>

<seg id="2299">And the letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers, that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome") seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the site and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscape fleas, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "whiskey and started to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust first received full access in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the clerks just began to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats spoke" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empiries, maps showing who owned something: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all the way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader base, including 'The Labourer' that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says.</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century portrayed his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was dug out).</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not be crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we'll get them much more common," "" "said Mr. Sharkey on the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes more worrying, as many robots have the "personalities" that a stepmother woman would look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed characters such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality that suits your personality as good as possible," enthuses true Companion's website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day it also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape if one goes a step on Frigid (means here: resisting) Farrah, alarm the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men naturally do not have sex robots, and while the FRR noticing their increasing popularity, they remain tentatively on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what escapes from the marginal zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive, until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maiden ') is not the graphical images, the swallowed body and the stoned eyes, but how realistic this vision acts.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible technically possible (although with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can't separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words: they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the Speech of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump-wisdom of the Trump-era that the political divisions that polarized U.S. electorate have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all ostensibly exert ourselves to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notice has been the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftish poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she fought for decades because of politics suddenly and completely strangely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is in another context that this also involves considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the striking effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "speaking of" "" "normalization" "" "and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his kittens will not be expelled one day." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as an epitome of reasonableness in comparison with its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's uric version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both of which appear to be very mild offences compared to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York park's carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the perspiring music imparts this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Themes-Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a curiously magical experience, since here two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this in order to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood excessively burdensome while I tired of the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts at his handwrists, which he, according to the prison authorities, suffered from a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">After an appeal by the prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, pouring it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he was his girlfriend for a nightly intruder, hiding in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National prosecution authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those concerned are usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium declines too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance supporting immune cells occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. Cruteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system works also among humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was accommodated separately, had not.</seg>

<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and there were found six species of bacteria present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them in the mice lacking.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they got the L. Cross and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as the idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter produced in Connecticut was on display next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift truck.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House Military Bureau required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy commander of the Navy.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3pm, and so long stayed until the turf was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 that evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The site of La League may regret its interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not indulge in its persecution by Neymar after giving up an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years before the record of the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous stamp, with Paul Poggiva returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and become the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about how Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalans stance is that the club has always given its best to take care of him since Santos was coming from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President in front of this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a severe warning for every club who wanted to subscribe to one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG-midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona felt the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price deals for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2881">On Thursday evening the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW arrived at the B 215 from Stolzenau in direction to Leese.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope Jean-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope Jean-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement, "We are Church," declared after publication in relation to the German press agency, he acquired an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the cathedral-chapel master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerived Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper," "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that" "" "double standards" "" "were measured when reporting on violence in the cathedral sparrows." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the grips in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future, but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of naming the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is part of everyday experience and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scarafia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we like to go to the church and that is a bound fresco." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "hits were a very normal educational tool" "", "" "" "to get ready with daring children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "" "" "it would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports about the misuse cases, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the souvenir sheet" "" "My brother the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report published by Mr. Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen was" "" "high-plausibility" "" "between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s," "" "67 cathedral-sparrows were sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to be Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that in many cases by Domkapellmeister, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality the punishment for the students could be even more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other defendants, however, many of the victims invoked the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even have positive memories associated with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal is relieved of his opinion on the Regensburger Domspatz Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violent exercise of protection ordered by the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "on the one hand, many students emphasize his" "" "humanity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it appears to be cholerician and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a cathedral sparrow did not bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also took place outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to reproach it at best, to experience it too late, or to have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The domain gymnasium on which he worked was felt by virtually all respondents as - literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent certificate, describes it as "warm hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who supplied the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to rage eruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only knock on the ground with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also gave ear-cowards and moved too cheeky guys to the hair or ears, he already admitted many years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such education methods were widespread in the period in question, in the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, this is certainly Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it has to do with his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, a report on the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen was reported in the media.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger engaged in the final report any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the dominator.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said a spokesman for the other," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even confide in parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader who, in a professional sense, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had early knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd, to assume that it was calculating him... Buben intrusive or clearer or even more open than their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"" "that one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "so the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "the fact that affected students and / or their surroundings trusted him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted by any fellow-man.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Therefore he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to an advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these vile crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "excesses" "" "was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former domain master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "Wayshowers" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything is mixed up and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is, in turn, an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is separated cleanly: between the pre-school and the secondary school of the cathedral-sparrows, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the cathedral sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were literally harassed and malolated and suffered terribly, all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys face when they were already on the domain gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the one hand, as most witnesses emphasise, the theme of "primary school" is taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the grammar school gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael hesitemann: there was discipline, but there was no voice of sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in whom the report concludes that" "" "many casualties are the general humanity of R." "" "and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories are connected with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">In this way, at most, the accusation remains to have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently closed the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the grammar school gymnasium, which the report even reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "the punishment will continue to be practised in the pre-school." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as testing fines were banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected people might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That simply isn't true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the punishment of schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis stated that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "" "snare of anachronism" "", "that is, the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that then.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all awful and I'm glad that it will finally be worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take protection from Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, that is, slap of the ear and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was forbidden, he was strictly bound by it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger give back to you in the discussions with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject audibility also a language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI., tells from his perspective, that the domes only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all mean that he had a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-trang institution, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, the rebellious boys don't even make a big singer and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience as Georg Ratzinger in the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic-good, deep faith and heart-good people, of which one cannot imagine that he could do something even for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with him, like many former domaines still today, 23 years after his emeridence, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral sparrows are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but it was also a lovely respectful person to which they still look up and who almost revere them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all you reproach is the methods of education that were the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which has just been published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the start-up would stop, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without which nobody outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to leave in peace.</seg>
