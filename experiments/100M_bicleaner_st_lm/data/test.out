a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother testified that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up again with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as murder and that the investigations were running .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed and destroyed by the ground on his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Frank &apos;s family and friends .

J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now made it un@@ ambig@@ uous in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be put into drawers or get stuck out from outside labels , which have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about being &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of the television with a lo@@ cker@@ ish de@@ bris and Mexican food , she says in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white gl@@ ut , she asks for the desire of children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not Child &apos;s Play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film will be scre@@ ened as of 25 August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sport pyramid
his experience on the horse is clear .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger and some colleagues searched for a little change with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; gold Py@@ ramid of the World &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and with that the riding career then ended again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again near horses .
he let himself run with his family through the installation of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even s@@ nat@@ ch for photo @-@ purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala the Golden League Py@@ ramid .
the sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic sports@@ man doesn &apos;t lack the awards .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ tour @-@ player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already rebu@@ ked him .
the 18th Win@@ ner of the Py@@ ramid of the World is a long one .
in Aachen on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has promoted the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros the same .
with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US Masters winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday .
the award @-@ winners include athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ engen , the fen@@ nel Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ dder Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um@@ er Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of those sports@@ men had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance from the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s All about the Money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - they want Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. presidential candidates are un@@ divided in terms of taxation and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosophical difference .
that , over the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wanted to control the economy to death and regulate his death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , con@@ tends Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive back regul@@ ators mas@@ sively , and he stands strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , it has opportunities to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why taxes would be raised for the rich , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost verb@@ ati@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate depl@@ ores the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strongly rejected by the state @-@ critical wing of the Republi@@ cans .
thus , party @-@ internal discussions might come to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in energy and climate policy are more clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ ramp up coal mining in the United States .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand the renewable energy with its investment programme and demands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ cal trade agreements , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , the United States do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should also be paid better , like Clinton .
the current minimum wage of US $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ attle , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand is Tr@@ ump who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics dis@@ regarded him so that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants to demand from the rich , is entitled to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every escaped woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has placed her small son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alised quarters for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs developed the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as hope @-@ carriers to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor killing , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who thinks that the end , as soon as they come to Germany , mis@@ lead , says B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps are often regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the housing in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what they have experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know to help , there are more accommodations just for them , B@@ ahr ur@@ ges .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
to the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their sphere of jurisdiction , some respond with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in shel@@ ters of governments .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fled women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , there can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study shows that the wash@@ rooms should be easily accessible separately and easily accessible to women .
how much the women feel this need for protection can be read from the urge to go to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
resident sur@@ geons : demands for new employment campaigns
assistant doctors have called on their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their disputes concerning a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more employment measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC testified that ministers had failed to address the concerns regarding the contract .
medical students and medical students agreed in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; would have had problems , which led to the rejection of the treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and call for official new talks to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour campaigns that begin at the beginning of September .
the disputes resulted in the fact that this year , assistant doctors struck six times , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA Assistant physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ ig@@ ned after the election for the rejection of the agreed contractual conditions , which had been recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings conven@@ ed before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident physicians and medical students that the contract was to be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated Room of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but would even improve .
the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something terrible had never happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but a radiant , lasting au@@ d@@ acity from Putin showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the launching of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into Russia .
the crime was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed boy@@ friend .
building up the ve@@ to will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for all .
most serious were the accus@@ ations made by senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from the President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was reli@@ eved last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his ministry .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television predicted cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti put it in the following way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West , as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin , which is keen to benefit from the cool sen@@ timent and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship with the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian Head of State earned a bonus for calling for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
for Moscow , this is a matter of course , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an analy@@ st once describing the &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that are driven from the West and feel badly treated and are now f@@ ading .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played its role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours on initial talks both pres@@ idents met at the press conference that they had not even touched on the subject .
the president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise it .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey rejected the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State talk at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the CEO of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized headquarters and the IP@@ Os will switch to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for retail banking that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
during a sightseeing tour , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed by customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming more a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am now saying that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become the bank of brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that these brands would have launched .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches 3,@@ 000@@ th gains in new market at Pre@@ dil@@ ection
D@@ ett@@ ori bri@@ g@@ les champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th gain
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone at Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won first on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that this happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ ers when he brings victory to Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ckey players have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by Win@@ ner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career opportunities
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a have inspired fans for this kind of sport for years .
I told Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already been a winner in the UK for nearly 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ ory Si@@ eben &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month ban , but he showed an impressive character in order to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his age of at least 5 years .
Russian Putin scor@@ ns chief of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of the stric@@ test confidence of Putin many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as Special Repres@@ entative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that without stating grounds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been a deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Estonian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief executive officer and Chief of Staff of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his appointment to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
will the smiling faces convince you ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was , for a long time , one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ dant and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff reti@@ res at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at this time .
but the official claim - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , would once again lead Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - plac@@ ate items for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was the president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , which replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted the most .
once it was believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another closest allies Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired when he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced in a joint statement his cancellation .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before announc@@ ing his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details about how the character Gib@@ son &apos;s character comes from the series that follows a team of FB@@ I agents will probably be published at a later date , according to the Opinion of the ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who had previously played in the sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my entire lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od over the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was hoping to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the twel@@ fth season will be broadcast on 28 September .
puzzles for fish that landed in Ban@@ ff &apos;s garden

Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could be sand eel with 75 fish that were picked up by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ or Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ Mountain cross country to the Vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Kei@@ th Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness@@ ing an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high @-@ end and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North tur@@ m@@ deck located in the expansion , we had to close the gap on the north or land@@ side .
this was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massive , as the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incline of approx . 3 % .
delicate because the tolerances on which the team was working were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded an alarm at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turning around and introduced us to the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we left the boat , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the shore rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have happiness un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone today w@@ akes up over these men .

who builds favorable housing units from Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be put into duty more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; housing concept for housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but controversy is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should actually build the favorable housing ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Vi@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments will have to exhibit as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the affordable housing can also be found in the inventory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall was , according to Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of housing as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions of euros and still needs to be financed , is to provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few rules as possible to investors .
the left wants even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
despite this , as Brat@@ mann , it initi@@ ates a sharpen@@ ing of the situation in the housing market .
if the action plan is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
but the programme is still not complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of further around 1,@@ 300 cheap homes , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , as the planning policy spokesperson , Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of getting apartments back to the price .
this is possible in the West City .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
at the end of the year , Fri@@ sten are running in the West City .
around 1800 hab@@ itation could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing associations .
for if the number of social housing in the West city is increased again dras@@ tically , one removes itself from the aim of so @-@ called confusion .
there should be no concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged people in only a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , the CD@@ U must launch a boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a ch@@ ase for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside , but rather prefer spending their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been compl@@ ained by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially on TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I naturally refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s ( later a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created .
like many of the phenomena of pop culture , interest declined slightly prior to the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , can be &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when it was younger , joined the tur@@ key and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person puts back every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of subsequent people who train 30 minutes each day , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks at the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met de@@ af ears because many public messages are d@@ ull to health and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always there are gru@@ es@@ ome game spo@@ ons , which must always complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what &apos;s it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even though Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with activ@@ ism in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget about the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on whole line .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast went on Thursday for the title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American women of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es do gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a majority and the fifth , while soli@@ di@@ fying her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey had come to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated her sport for the last three years , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awa@@ ited a final test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as dis@@ appointment .
the American Sist@@ ers Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ battle event of women at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday while she served as ex@@ clamation mark at the f@@ arewell party of the retired team coordinator , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although it insist@@ ed that during their long journey to the top , never having planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip to the gymn@@ asi@@ um , where Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a series of victories that will hold as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ afa decreased by two turns , the picture was blur@@ red .
floating beams and ground ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ king .
she resum@@ ed with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swedish bar again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor there was still another .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected her grand@@ son - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears poured into pic@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal was in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke an Must@@ afa .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; Grand@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
after her floor exercise she threw down to the public kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in mass kill@@ ings when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a weapon , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , to read in the report .
the police told that triple murder was not the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that shooting triggered the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic farming areas within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; it is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; said Howard of K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and that the same mur@@ derer was committed .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
one witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting that was aimed at an empty pick @-@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it was assumed that it was the factory of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his age , Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage it .
I don &apos;t manage it .
I did not let myself go on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course you &apos;ve got involved in it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband , Vincent , and her husband , have been informed that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund can walk with help .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit or craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ple@@ dged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented some notes alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or ci@@ ca@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect anyone to really tell me .
but pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to sum@@ mon the emergency stand on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi river floo@@ ded its banks and threatened with large @-@ area floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards states that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the communities affected .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , informed that the requests for flood craft , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday while it continued to rain in the mobile field .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels after the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the tro@@ dden rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still plu@@ cked people from the flood water in the districts Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and son @-@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ be .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that Be@@ aver Creek &apos;s water , which is usually more than 400 feet from his house , is rising overnight .
he said that another son of his son who lives nearby had warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such an elevated position of the river during the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency Hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer registered in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that due to the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday , the soil was considerably hal@@ ogen@@ ic .
the authorities indicated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and school groups in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary , WW@@ L reported that a R@@ ank@@ ed in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacks 200 in@@ und@@ ated homes .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , both floo@@ ded now .
the Chief of the Rob@@ by Miller community said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were flus@@ hed out of the flood .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were established to house the ev@@ acu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen high@@ ways were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand bags were provided for the residents , hoping to be able to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ au of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information a handful of houses were reported to have been reported as floo@@ ded on Thursday , but on Friday were not reported until now .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; and it is still coming . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; surrounded by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot wounds , including in the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did a lot , his little body was en@@ ra@@ ged with bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z told the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the broad@@ ca@@ ster that he is likely to recover .
he would have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot on , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that there was apparently a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ ies for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , survived the crime scene .
it seems that this is definitely an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were sleeves .
it seems that there have been several armed fighters who were involved very actively , &quot; police det@@ ach@@ man Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di sent to the transmitter in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ port@@ edly checking the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross trainer on her arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the ladies &apos; olymp@@ i@@ onship in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and this for more than one reason .
first , I joined each summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant .
and secondly , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is ca@@ tho@@ lic , round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally mirrors the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and ju@@ bel@@ te .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple champi@@ onships of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected but master@@ ful gymn@@ astic routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won gold at an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see exercise classes throughout the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie were all beating the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four men in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily come up in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics lie in well @-@ to @-@ do suburbs who can support the business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long lasting commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained their athletes since they started gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to au@@ n countless young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and accessible exercise .
I founded my trainers 20 years ago .
at my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( mostly black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the spirit .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will make thousands of young girls interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team spirit and thank you , she motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
Regi@@ stra@@ r would like to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 resident sur@@ geons who voted for a vote rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t had un@@ v@@ eiling plans to introduce the treaty by force and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first resident doctors are expected to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend dates in order to improve care at irregular times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistance physicians announced last night in a message with : &quot; Regi@@ stra@@ in@@ arians will still have serious concerns about the deal proposed , especially that it will inc@@ ite the current availability crisis and it will be given to treat all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress has to be made and time is running out .
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by talks clas@@ hed with the government on account of reluc@@ tance and at times appe@@ aled to de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the case of a promise Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t made only last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t needs to act now , raise awareness and address the concerns of resident doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he fails to do so , the resident doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work @-@ fighting measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included to cover doctors on the strike line .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA aims to pay a better week@@ day pay for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , urged the doctors to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour campaigns reach nothing but little , but stress already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months we have talked to the Committee of Regi@@ stra@@ in@@ arians and have responded positively to concerns regarding guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other key topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional apprentices@@ hip , training colle@@ ges , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - a sign of how serious the employers , the Health Education United Kingdom and the Ministry of Health were about resp@@ ecting the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day medication that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from a heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form layers .
when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month take of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said : &quot; in spite of the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack or stroke - often have disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with A@@ spir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture poll@@ utes electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office due to corruption .
a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread poll@@ ing in Muslim communities ignor@@ ingly being ignored , as a devastating government report today revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town coun@@ cils to ignore evidence of electoral abuse on account of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an antagon@@ ist politi@@ cian , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set off tapes outside of electoral cabins in order to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
it is recommended that voters should have an identification card to prove their identity when poll@@ ing elections .
at present , a vot@@ er simply has to name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they release their vote in order to prevent someone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud but should also protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Elec@@ toral Channel in the east of London .
last year , a Special Tribunal decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved of a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal fashion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic charges . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed in particular alarm to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter elections - with the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading ID to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the El@@ ders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... government institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities with respect to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric described 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists manipul@@ ate mail @-@ selection documents to stop &quot; elections . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires har@@ sh@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters about your identity before choosing .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given up her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection .
ban on political activists to edit full let@@ ter@@ ets and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ ets .
the police have the authority to set up shut @-@ off for election stations .
a change in the law which was facilit@@ ated by an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the People &apos;s Act of 1983 ( People &apos;s Li@@ ability Act 1983 ) .
photography ban in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule out the rule that voters go to the cabin alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ for Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ up checks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the elec@@ tive registration departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous doppel@@ gan@@ ger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have come across the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T outside the rim and band , which has proven to be an impressive double @-@ lon@@ er of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only ath@@ lete competing for gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not when you can give faith to the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker on our screens at the moment , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that have more than a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush to Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star in a very similar way .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself see no great simil@@ arity , except facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I think it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British designer Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her large expressive eyes is supposed to be the Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a gear higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal at Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory put into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter user told her cont@@ ent@@ ment that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face to face and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ laim@@ s for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds &apos; analysis of the fourth place of 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style floating sc@@ aff@@ el ou@@ tra@@ geous spectators of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
the Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators told that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers called &quot; how low &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he had to give his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free style floating sc@@ aff@@ el .
Mac@@ Donald , who was brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard saying , &quot; This small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the union , baby . &quot;
too excited , he passed away like a pig , and died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the chin@@ ese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy scale 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor jer@@ k , which allowed the Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers in Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shock@@ ed by the tone and speech
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not realize that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han in China was described as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was quick and hard when many people were talking about him .
Twitter users didn &apos;t stay back when they heard how un@@ aware By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like ra@@ cists . # is disgu@@ ised .
shortly afterwards Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast on a floating performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ al via Twitter
the comment colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC rus@@ hed and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broad@@ cast@@ ed .
yesterday we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on the show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not to them as a person .
yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy chosen formula . By@@ ron is very sorry about what he said .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald appeared in the show trying to justify his re@@ mark by stating that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the float performance and not on it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no dis@@ regard intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark indign@@ ant about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try out under@@ pants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation she looked as she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back to the shelf .
she continued to browse and ta@@ sted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the pants before she put them back on the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out their own trousers and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she simply stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that obviously didn &apos;t please her , as she put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three further pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , moved out and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bo@@ ther anyone observing - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take home pants that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull out the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new couple and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and she didn &apos;t get washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our Folk@@ stone branch . &quot;
all products in question have been withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself from arms attacks using Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer to your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you are approaching you from behind , you should turn it first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then seize the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before h@@ itting it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him then with his knee in the bar and twist the weapon out of his hands while the Att@@ acker attacks against pain . beat him with the barrel and move backwards as you set the weapon on him .
at attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , grab the weapon and twist them , so the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
shift the weight on the weapon at the same time and beat the Att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it performs in Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that at a rob@@ ber@@ y it is saf@@ est to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide book his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ du@@ ed his immune system and stran@@ gl@@ ehold of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his train on a euro note , a ban@@ ister on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before the departure of each object he used a lumin@@ aire to show himself and us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to light .
the thought to det@@ ach the sink @-@ button of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his trip through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left behind what he was tas@@ ked with , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling around the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings at railway stations to flus@@ hing buttons of toilets , the task proved definitely to be under a sample
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample stri@@ pe showed a lumin@@ timeter count of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilette that he refused to dep@@ ose after its lumin@@ aires were over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 units .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics at the same time .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings that ended with saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon .
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say that - I &apos;ve lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilette that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to blame them and others , with whom this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria especially with the well @-@ being of the stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
social family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation Social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ ci@@ ale family left their social apartment after a deletion of £ 50,000 because they terrori@@ zed their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ pp@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shock@@ ed employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were filled with g@@ aping holes , wood panels were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it is now living in private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for home management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is probably considered to be not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror they had inflic@@ ted on the family consisted of street fights with bas@@ eball bat , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ fe and floods .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , in June got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour .
in some rooms of the house that will be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish has been found
in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn
neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the street and called on regularly to inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner viol@@ ently by the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw them .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , stated that it would have ab@@ used the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the community house
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family as a deletion is always the last step taken into consideration by Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and sent us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they all were over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the deletion on the ground .
workers in the house administration will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as gar@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by received a fine after ow@@ ning himself to the property of a drug of class B in commercial vision .
she claimed that the money was a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the house walls were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will deleg@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not stick to the rules of the house
Angela C@@ row of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police informed that the deletion was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the rules of the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ reproach as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour , which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal set in panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless military jet flies to the beach
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal , experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air Force aircraft put an incredible crash
the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no safety risk
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists started panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless jet was crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ot@@ ings showed how the military plane flew almost in close proximity to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped up when they were understand@@ ably starting to worry about the noise of the de@@ bris , without first seeing what came up through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who posted videos on the dramatic Fly By in the social media , said : &quot; twice really flew very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the airplane would drop down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to the bad visibility of the area , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the mainland Portugal this summer , in which four people also died on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong fog and smoke , which limits his view .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with a worry about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step towards the first title win in the new Football Season .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super Cup against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ play increases three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the dou@@ ble@@ w@@ ner must ren@@ ounce in the correlation of forces with the defeated cup@@ fin@@ alists and reig@@ ning Europe @-@ League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , there is also a lack of Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
in the course of the training , the German suffered a change of leg in the knee , which at least initially cleared the demand for Bar@@ ca in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen were competing for the status as the number one .
coach Luis En@@ rique made a clear decision on this matter so far and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the remaining applicants .
before the first obligatory play of the new season there are doubts about the fitness status of the team , who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the trial of S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really persu@@ ade .
Sev@@ ille , in turn , managed to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after the extension of the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph of &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
Barcelona is the record winner of this race with eleven successes .
Ma Long in its own league for table tennis
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Spirit Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) .
the world tran@@ gli@@ sten first took the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ als tournament and the Olympic Games .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected into the final game and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ onn@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and time @-@ outs , they didn &apos;t have any coaches with them .
they had withdrawn into the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches to this point have been played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said in consequence .
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists were awarded with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
then he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma did not develop the expected stirring match .
nevertheless , nevertheless , sufficient breath @-@ taking ball changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ zut@@ ani won the game around Bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ rus@@ se had suffered a breach of ri@@ b , was then in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have become similar to a high table tennis player Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now acknowledged defici@@ encies in his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident multi @-@ billi@@ on@@ ist expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race in the Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians , whom he asked for support in key states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt was false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media scene .
shaking Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the re@@ public@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were compl@@ aining .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that Republi@@ can candidates are common in the state .
also Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , he said , Tr@@ ump continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party is said to have threatened Tr@@ ump to withdraw funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present better questionn@@ aires .
instead of that , the Republi@@ cans &apos; candidates are more likely to engage in Congress for Congress .
Olympia : three fraud on dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary committee on the case .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
after an attempt at a Dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee announced to promptly set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function had announced that the former Spr@@ inter and current coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village gave a Ur@@ ine sample under the name of the 800 metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported to the Ken@@ yan team leader by dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has requested the IO@@ C for information on the case to ex@@ ert its own investigation into an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the measures taken by IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , delivered the sample and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch was in 2015 in Beijing World Cup fourth more than 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics He@@ ads of He@@ ads , Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch , had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed the athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested in Nairobi at his return .
Kenya has been under special observation since the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences since a long time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks submitted by IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was un@@ common to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympic Games .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya viewed from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya counts as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a number of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly asser@@ ted that in Kenya dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently demanded a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in the Russian athle@@ tics .
it could be proven that this type of sport has been systematically reduced .
Russian athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shakespeare @-@ Jahr &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lover couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ verk@@ amp Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary in a youth space .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the bat@@ on of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos; music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli is playing an older Maria .
she rec@@ alls with melanch@@ oly about her swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and bright and bright . &quot;
so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern tem@@ per , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the local public went to New York , and New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
these are the same topics , and today they are as meaningful as they were then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London School Girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ sk@@ je@@ e , lawyer , said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as warning and warning to others , that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - stopping people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ sk@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow in a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in case of election victory in Gar@@ land
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the pres@@ idency candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked the confirmation of Finland since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that Clinton expects to select Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he hadn &apos;t talked with Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he was spec@@ ul@@ ating .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not be worried about a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .

&quot; &quot; &quot; tre@@ ats wants to make nude calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works together with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out a 1970 &quot; Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine is different from old school play@@ boys , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , it is the view that the Calendar does .
&quot; we have to return to the representation of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ edness in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish municipality anticip@@ ates mass flight
&quot; those who don &apos;t adapt to Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates a short term with tens of thousands of people who seek refuge from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ali Top@@ ra@@ k , Chairman of the Association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh action of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already over@@ taken Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds ahead of months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing inside Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dec@@ ei@@ ving put@@ sch , there are still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further repres@@ sed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state who receives refugees alone produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the group accused the specific settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in the al@@ evi@@ tic towns .
that is what Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association called for the federal government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned itself as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany there is also a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len @-@ Tra@@ iler destro@@ ys the professional existence of teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics .
&quot; those who do not adapt to Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the c@@ em@@ alists and secular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks had already set up the largest group of asylum @-@ seek@@ ers recognized by political persecution in Germany before the coup .
on the reporting date June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all who were eligible for granted asylum seek@@ ers ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there are no signs of war , poverty or lack of perspective .
asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively politically , i.e. by the state side , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it w@@ eh@@ ls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wei@@ rd Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
2021 elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Assembly already decided at the beginning of the year .
because it &apos;s not stupid as far as so far : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ election campaign - that bit@@ es itself .
the locals , who want to be convinced by the election champi@@ ons , are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so do not choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and count voices in the end , only pain@@ stak@@ ingly gr@@ asp@@ ing .
until September 4 , 2016 , the day of the election and the last day of the festival , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has yet to pass an election campaign close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and there is also something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
it will be exciting , how strongly new af@@ ening Af@@ D inter@@ sec@@ ts and what remains at the end of coalition @-@ dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the country , spreading ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a bit with the people , just as his legendary wor@@ dless predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , seaf@@ ar@@ ers have got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel will blame for the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the most beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its leading candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make an election campaign at the right place at the wrong time .
she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations twice ; Merkel &apos;s German election circle is located in the North East .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual election campaigns on market@@ places and shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that means Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union , too , noted that in the country you are br@@ asing the basis that it has to be very strict to find a wire to people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly available in the expan@@ se of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U election champion Kok@@ ert on his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they have to go where they are , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday celebration must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called on its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were at the end with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into parliament .
they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of vac@@ ation@@ ing and transfer their election campaigns to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the president of the country , Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green elec@@ tors go to search for local vocal cords among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake L@@ akes and finds it also beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 8@@ pm , there is always praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything pretty sh@@ ak@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be finished .
the conci@@ liation of those responsible for the construction work is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to setting up residence permits .
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has resum@@ ed , the traffic situation within the town has eased .
the citizens now can drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the pass through the village seems to be going back .
&quot; there were sometimes significant complaints , &quot; said the deputy head of the project , Florian King , responsible for the rehabilitation management of the rehabilitation .
the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping lanes were looking for and more familiar to their navigation system than the sign@@ age .
which led to some dec@@ eased truck stops in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not met , the congregation called for M@@ ös@@ singen &apos;s measurement vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been inj@@ ected .
the fastest was on the way with 77 hours per hour at the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ Zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become cal@@ mer .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the street is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to sales breaks allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has little consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mil@@ eage is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily bag@@ ged are the local restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words .
that is exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants did &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he refers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; street renov@@ ations have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dropped &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he dismissed half of his associates .
if I had a firm with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location at the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something has been handled more gener@@ ously .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family client@@ ele comes back at the end of the rehabilitation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is constantly being scre@@ ened in the name of counter @-@ terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the latest attacks , the Home Secretary of the Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a toler@@ able status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Rec@@ on@@ c@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anybody .
other additional points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also em@@ bed myself in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was close to the results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the latest attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère ced@@ ed a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach before he presents his conclusions for safety in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things are already known , announced , announced , that a new security authority to address the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
not even the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU targets on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is not surprising as well .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt on proposals which have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups on pun@@ ish@@ ments and send jihadi@@ sts with double nationality to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he nonetheless considers this to be reasonable and also demands nothing , which has no chances in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them have it in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the incar@@ cer@@ ation of people from deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should be allowed to check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check @-@ up .
in the case of dos@@ ages for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or consciously throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are politically and legally delicate .
many things also have an unpleasant effect and leaves any questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people worried about security .
and things that people deeply occupied did not let themselves be sp@@ las@@ hed out even in election campaigns .
the focus is on inner security .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the moves in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral struggles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days , it went up between the two parties .
only a long @-@ standing controversy over the equipment of the federal police , then about a security policy collection of some of the Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ resort chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
also here de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory tones .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything away from a departure from the double pass .
we met the discussion in Germany .
you do not make sense to re@@ plen@@ ish it .
and he has constitutional obj@@ ections to a Bur@@ ka ban .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it still has to show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things to worry about .
but the SPD , too , is currently trying to improve on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel recently sign@@ alizes cau@@ ti@@ ously and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still playing gli@@ mm@@ atically .
despite diesel @-@ sc@@ and@@ als , the number of delivery numbers is rising worldwide .
but not all markets are running smoothly .
in the recall action there is confusion about a term .
in the second half of the year , Volkswagen will start with the deliveries .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can still present a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW weak@@ ens mainly in Western Europe and thus again loaded the total sales , as the company listed in the D@@ ax .
in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
sales alone in Western Europe , the second most important market after China , were 14 percent lower than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries dropped by almost a sixth .
brand sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a reluc@@ tance to buy in some core markets due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British cous@@ in also stressed the withdrawal from the EU , explaining a spokes@@ woman .
in the US , where the exhaust gases first escal@@ ated , a further minus is available .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected home brand of the Lower Saxony is still further frau@@ dul@@ ently due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an ex@@ tradition minus 0.@@ 9 percent is accounted for by 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales Chief Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales spl@@ its from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen has been manipul@@ ating exhaust tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles for conversion to the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
after re@@ equi@@ pping the car , the car manufacturer offers a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was stated on Friday in corporate circles .
they are legal refin@@ ements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee of converted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my inquiry committee and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Minister of Transport , Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , according to the Ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion , VW does not have any deteri@@ or@@ ations and all type @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it meant in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come to a workshop half a year after the conversion , and could lead to the new software even if the damage does not have anything to do with it .
even in the interest of customers , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal can lead to uncertainty about possible warranty regulations , as it was said .
this is why VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
in future , Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ al interest from rich savers - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; chief manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 139 clients who park 40 million Euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks appeals to a single case and does not see any signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would not have to fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay pen@@ alties for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fee calls for the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding EUR 100,000 in cash or daily cash accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time now , he be@@ ware 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the next and that he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on my central bank account and cause a cost of 0.4 percent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle , the costs are now being disclosed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leaving the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve already seen four cases , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bank Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed to other investment forms .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operative federation of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to wear it alone is not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have raised their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gia Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pun@@ ish@@ ments for deposits from 3 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay land @-@ wide fees for deposits , and competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele , endow@@ ed with wealth a bit more luxuri@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it guards for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;

destination Pl@@ ates : who actually buy records ?
sol@@ itary middle @-@ aged men love plates .
before you hur@@ ry to comment under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non Alle@@ en@@ ary Co@@ verage of Middle @-@ A@@ ged with ar@@ du@@ ous insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed resur@@ gence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als , which would welcome the news of physical objects , but due to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no horror through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record sal@@ es@@ men retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and gra@@ ceful before I stop , hold my hands and say something better like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
although Soh@@ o &apos;s heart is slowly lost in its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent vendors were based - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I &apos;m from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men middle @-@ aged , a woman , probably around 20 ) is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 records .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his dispos@@ able income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buying items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I &apos;ve probably been a little too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets have to apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub , people who have heard about com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
from the conversations that I have conducted , people tend to get rid of their collection as a rule around 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom in parti@@ sans of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers contacted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sil@@ enc@@ ers , objects that evo@@ ke happy reminis@@ c@@ ences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is an easy way to mentally concern yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff fle@@ es from a stack of plates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this point in the news report I would probably look very worried as I leaf through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone came up until recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ less , less music @-@ wise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly .
opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and women of middle aged .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts is the latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ tant pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks stran@@ gely enough , but na@@ ï@@ ve psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to find if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a couple of minutes and looks at the variety of panels for sale .
it rather makes a window @-@ shopping as a big shopping .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives away with a loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while giving the impression of dar@@ ing the je@@ ans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing themselves together for a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , they are not taken into account , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they certainly do not spend their Thursday mor@@ nings with their sleeves through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through plates , while they flat@@ ly avoid the star@@ ing look of an aw@@ k@@ ward , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false Moder@@ ator , resting on the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects offering over demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to submit 72 temporary businesses where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dres@@ sers or to sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would involve a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also noted that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely to feed people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting places between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the tears was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is usually operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids &apos; Café intact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants cher@@ ished on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers over the summer .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , it &apos;s hard to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace what reasons had led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed over the past few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adjust to the next generation of speed knives : in different federal states , including H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which are intended to be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic Enfor@@ cement trailer of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident areas , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to building bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that speed limits are observed with a stationary speed camera .
a permanent mobile structure can , however , be too dangerous or costly .
the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery keeps five days in an un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across several tracks .
variable speed limits as well as drive ban according to time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition you can pull the trailer according to manufacturer with every car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels disappear in the arm@@ oured and by the way also shot @-@ proof outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the information provided by Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities are also flas@@ hing with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 items , after an order of 150 units last year .
Britain retri@@ eves silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji brings Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7th Ru@@ g@@ by in the final on Thursday evening led to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were struck with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the Pom@@ odoro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji issued a master class in handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , back @-@ back , line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour .
the defeat was swe@@ pt away by the not too bad silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former head of England of Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind .
eight years ago , she lost each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under Ry@@ an .
here they lost only one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and let the attacks clutch their bases from fun .
it felt like Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if you were running in running buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au crossed over the corner .
with another four minutes of playing time Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner that he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a scor@@ ching T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it just stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute scored a Touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the start of the game and there was still a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided over additional weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB still cores .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through after a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favour of the South Sea sul@@ tan@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle rang , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB crushed in crus@@ hing into the grass .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als of 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning are inspired by the fight with the coach &apos;s cancer for ru@@ dder victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that wants to be called something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only the two who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the two without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British sport , who laid down such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ 000 in@@ exhaus@@ tible effort , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ins gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and nobody was more instrumental than the trainer , who did not know 30 months ago whether he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is operated and that did it .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit of the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right concept in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it starts .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve w@@ aking morning talking about something more than usual and trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with it .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams started to start from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
this would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
has been exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , retired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small , f@@ rat@@ ernal drinking water pur@@ ser as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago , it was in the original on a contribution of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
little later , the Water Forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia government acknowledged the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ te stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was a member of the staff for 31 years , stands for 28 years as Managing Director .
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water pur@@ vey@@ or of the V@@ ei@@ te stein@@ gruppe with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 towns and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member congregations are the congregations of Kirch@@ stät@@ ter , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ tah .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ n mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was appointed as a water@@ man in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the German Uni@@ fication Association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , planning of the budget , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chair@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , it called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and repar@@ ation of the farmers , the re@@ development of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there have been no stal@@ em@@ ate and there have always been innovations , because water is the most important food for life and drinking water .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has fought with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association down@@ right as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ te stein@@ gruppe on nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for that he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , on his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful k@@ not .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ building and the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ation of the Zw@@ eck@@ ers association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the rup@@ ture of the pipe at the elevated tank at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the Dr@@ inking Water Board was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots on partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday and injured them mort@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and said to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , and after him , he is made public .
meanwhile Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is about 1.80 m tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald head .
in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile , the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide any information about the death or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a crime off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Optics for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial burdens arising from the sector from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
it remains at the liberation of the renewable energy environment in the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Frei@@ tag@@ ungen ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry was facing an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies .
but this too will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on electricity generation .
thus the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have particular significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more have to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation further ag@@ grav@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China threw massive steel into the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers are throwing price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little .
on the one hand , aff@@ i@@ xed import duties have an effect on import @-@ steel , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have increased .
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated more .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp finally did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung Stahl shared on Friday .
after a short rise in May , the manufactured amount returned after the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production is two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output .
community , mind , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject of music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more vivid , she says .
by the way , she does something good about her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors in several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says from the German sen@@ iors league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing .
anyone who challenges his lungs regularly gets out of the d@@ olls in everyday life too .
even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the German Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Organis@@ ations .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia suffer@@ ers decline with long rec@@ lining happ@@ enings .
when singing , a special performance is required for the head , explains L@@ enz .
to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler believes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience reinfor@@ ces .
good reasons to start singing there is enough .
anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , he advis@@ es L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound comes next to it ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , you can simply join them .
many cities also have views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the Church leader directly .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good to the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males to cri@@ es of the k@@ itt@@ ens
in Hannover , bi@@ ologists have studied which effect the calls of cat babies have on adult animals .
to her surprise , the ch@@ ewing also did not let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved alike in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of cat babies at the sight of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to l@@ utes of k@@ itt@@ ens , who think in great need , as scientists have found out from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young@@ sters are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance for the males , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es with the ur@@ gency of their need for help .
altogether nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a cri@@ cket of small ones , who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited kit@@ ten , which were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , responded to the cri@@ es , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned to the loudspeaker more quickly , when this calls of the very excited kit@@ ten were playing .
this ability may be alleged or develop@@ ped with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby noise several times in humans .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , reported the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ del@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski acc@@ esses Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala . &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ley@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will be held in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even with the exception of the emergency situation after the July revolution , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
football is not stopped even before football .
against the former Str@@ ong Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant .
according to this , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ley@@ r is to be a suppor@@ ter of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is held responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the exceptional status suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , but actually this has no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places across the country declared Erdo@@ gan &apos;s end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the &quot; possession &quot; club of Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans themselves agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially arriving on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne has demonstrated its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all the competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record player found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion .
after the Pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; f@@ arewell too early in the Europa League .
in the South of Li@@ g , there was only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done that and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year passed better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season ap@@ rons as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sten @-@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the same time , the Gom@@ ez sig@@ nat@@ ory , who had signed an agreement with the AC Florence , announced that after the coup attempt , Gom@@ ez only had to be announced after the coup attempt to not return to the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million Euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Or@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We cannot pay its pay in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin had already been banned twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Y@@ uli@@ a Step@@ an@@ owa is not allowed to start in Rio .
other over @-@ led athle@@ tics sinners can laugh at it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who , after a dop@@ ing lock , had acc@@ li@@ mati@@ zed her start right before the games , was whi@@ st@@ led mer@@ cil@@ essly at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) and ble@@ w out .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a s@@ miles she was still in the hall and provoked her appearance .
when it was fixed that they were not going to pick up gold , the audience broke out in a whi@@ rl@@ wind .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el , USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had already been banned twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to shut down a six @-@ month ban in 2010 after taking the pain with Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had a strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion from 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European champi@@ onships from 2010 to 2016 , was positively tested for the ban on stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ af@@ ine .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the sent@@ in@@ es@@ and was bar@@ red for six months .
the four wid@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold favorites .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el , USA ) : the Peking Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , had been positively tested in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , mut@@ ed Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete was subsequently recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was determined testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand over Olympic Silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title in 2006 due to testosterone deficiency .
he also received the bronze medal for the 2008 Olympic Games due to a ruling by the International Court of Justice CA@@ S .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked second of the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record chan@@ cell@@ or and gold @-@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested in May , but may still be launched in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications of taking a banned dietary supplement have been found , the ban of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency WA@@ DA sli@@ d mil@@ dly and ran off on July 13th .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered from wounds and had been treated in hospital but I have already left this .
she planned her home trip at the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens , it is still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as waste .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , were initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening in a residential area .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , another human being killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb det@@ onation in the morning .
the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular beach resort of Pat@@ ong , which was popular with tourists , was injured by a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
after all det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ eastern coast demanded several wounded .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ kom@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express himself about possible motives - but probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize in the attacks a pattern which is typical of the Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , one assumes that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the authorities have kept secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and the places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unclear which group is sitting behind the attacks .
the police abandoned their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around major government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of them are not directed against tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over the years of Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the bom@@ b@@ astic bom@@ b@@ ings , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary travel in these provinces is dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution laid out by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this has a great impact on the military during the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to fom@@ ent chaos while the country was heading towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , is committed to restoring the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du S@@ hr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t assass@@ ination of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several national offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation also made the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the indications for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the German press agency Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ eva in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are being vili@@ fied in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we now observe the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multic@@ ultural &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitu@@ tion@@ ists in nine provinces - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot;
Ma@@ eva said that his authority was closely aligned with the local authorities in the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief constitutional officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with pop music .
that &apos;s what Islamic fundament@@ alists do as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a real publicity for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda should appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there have been reports of contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
Ma@@ aß continued to say that he had no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the substantial increase in lawful crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and asylum seek@@ ers Ma@@ owned , he would not yet speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years we have found that there can be legal @-@ terrorism structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
it may well be that further groups of right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
but a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed concern about the fact that many attacks on the account of people did not appear before in the right @-@ hand scene .
this is wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum lod@@ g@@ ings had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right @-@ wing scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who were politically indiffer@@ ent or voted for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , who , however , have radic@@ alized themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this shows Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros &apos;s cour@@ a@@ geous performance during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ looked s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia came so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently used for the viral interaction .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old completed his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and won the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more known in under@@ represented countries .
since most athletes are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media called him &quot; Ro@@ bel of the wh@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity club &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he struck a minute and almost five seconds about the 100 meter fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ bal@@ ban@@ i &apos;s run for media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the performance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a race over 100 metres of free style alone .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ bal@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learnt to swim only eight months before Olympia and never had a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop in the new place has been fo@@ aled .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30 p.m. and forgotten to close a window on the ground floor .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat so closely
the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is speaking at an election rally in Florida .
should there be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already been an alternative video .
he will go on holiday then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with U.S. television broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , this was fine , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
in doing so , he described U.S. President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
there was more and more opposition in his party .
post enters into trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the mail is planning to sell their electric vehicle stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
shortly the corporation wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the mail wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market from the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to embar@@ k on sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been examining whether they will sell their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ ball @-@ sco@@ oter , with which the letters and par@@ c@@ els are delivered , also to other farms .
post @-@ board member Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely inquiries , such as by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bonn company will shortly enter into mass production of vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ production facility , the company plans to build up to 10,000 vehicles per year per shift .
Ger@@ ald had announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its electric cars fleet and make a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the complete fleet .
the Sco@@ oter is active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership decreases after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ backs came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K made it clear that the chair of board chairman Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more un@@ safe , the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ences at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the global number five of the industry faces a personnel new beginning .
chief Executive Officer wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert has already retired from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , Managing Board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , already took over the management board as of September 1 , announced the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is supposed to officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; board spokes@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the return , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
those who will be leading the market research firm in future are still unclear at this time .
it was said on Friday that the shareholders were most recently disappointed with the continued success of the restructuring initiated several years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each investor will be rest@@ less some@@ time .
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also do the qu@@ and@@ ts , &quot; he said .
following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the Company had not been able to stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales in the previous year were 6.1 percent lower than in the previous year &apos;s quarter .
in the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1,2 million euros shr@@ ank by 3.4 per cent .
in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter have been bur@@ dened above all by the decline in value of the company .
the Group posted a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.2 million , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit of 139 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K achieved a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight wounded
in case of an accident of a touring coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries .
according to her information , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach from the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade a vice , which drove partially on the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people couldn &apos;t leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the scene of the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner quarter of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the lor@@ ry and possible witnesses to contact the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare 3.@@ 44 instead of previously 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ ure 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ Village , the waste water fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a trans@@ lu@@ cent calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ Village will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Ros@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rats@@ amt Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was found that there were under@@ wear for these sewage plants .
due to legal bases , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities at a cost @-@ cover@@ able manner .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ thi@@ essen , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ tec@@ , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt presented the body , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also overl@@ app@@ ings from the previous calculation period .
Schmidt explained the serious fee increases with the fact that all three sewage systems are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water injection that varies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water supply in all three plants is easily retro@@ grade .
furthermore , in the past calculation period , all three plants were not least due to their age refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenditure to a considerable extent .
the facility in Az@@ Village is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ thi@@ essen , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt referred to the fact that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the waste water system Az@@ tec@@ s .
in the Wel@@ th@@ ahl pumping station , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge was removed and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to be able to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still below the current level at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water losses in the three plants , expenses for operation and maintenance are &quot; fully swe@@ pt through . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs in the waste water systems , has been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run according to stone houses , especially since the supply area of the sewage disposal association Fri@@ es@@ en@@ bach@@ tal cannot be expanded by these facilities , because these facilities are defici@@ ent .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first about zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the average annual inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ised
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is not sensitive to breeds .
with its filter tool , snap@@ shots allow about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that has already borders the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein color paintings .
the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all false entran@@ ts reach the public .
in the past snap@@ shots have cri@@ tically drawn criticism in which they were accused that the app would promote black@@ face fo@@ e or white skin as beauty ideal .
when it proposed a filter to some users this week , which gave them sl@@ otted eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics knew a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; ja@@ un@@ dice . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem the company has with diversity .
the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have turned off the feature .
the company had an excuse : the filter was meant to pay tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism rec@@ alled the inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely spread across the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and mil@@ dly said unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not properly secured , but that the yellow face has been dra@@ gged into the de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating extrem@@ ity .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could assume more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters an image that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that ra@@ cial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the placement practices of snap@@ shots .
Z@@ hu was critical of the large part white , only male leadership and ended their article with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ amer@@ ican Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has left the Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural background of its staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel responsible , concentr@@ ating on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said , for their part , they will let their Snap@@ chat account be closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that that &apos;s not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , establishes Committee of Congress
military officers of the United States Central Command changed intelligence in order to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground , report an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Committee of the Army Com@@ mittees , Secret Service Com@@ mittees , and the budget commission@@ er , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence gathering , typically st@@ unted by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly drew up a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on the spot and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ en Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ com range from the top to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports , it shows how analysts face pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com associate publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin already in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Department of Defense .
the Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , in some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments regarding IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the highest ranking Democ@@ rat of the Committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inj@@ ected Mor@@ ality under Analy@@ st and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave an excessive amount of space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analysts regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were received after complaints from Cent@@ com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense have welcomed a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the last year &apos;s accus@@ ations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State ev@@ okes disputes from more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a scrip@@ ture about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and gave little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , according to government agencies , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , since these temporary refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Command@@ l@@ sh@@ aber , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the US winning fourth match in women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with the UK before
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two doors for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not among the people who keep their doors in mind .
but she knows that : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in her group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory over Japan .
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of them will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will move the strong Dutch slightly longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
however , as always the game may go out on Saturday , the American women have caused a surprising turbul@@ ence due to their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up at Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , became coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things into a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ around in London that we now have .
we have been able to w@@ ander the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a back@@ stop from the near area .
India went into play without winning the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball through the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to record a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro will feel steady and in@@ es@@ capable , a fast @-@ pac@@ ed e@@ as@@ el between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the olymp@@ ic torch itself is a burning rod , which is handed down from the arm arch@@ ers to the tri@@ ath@@ lete to the swi@@ mmer to the gymn@@ ast .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversations in the coffee shop without hearing About Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the fight between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a black g@@ ull with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , structured by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ c@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognized : pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ sely aware that many of them , I had questioned , didn &apos;t know that it was an Olympic report anyway .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an ath@@ lete who made it to the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians have a tendency to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than for the Olympics .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a veter@@ an enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ istic trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending boun@@ ce - but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially unites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish trampoline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , real and sal@@ ts ) before they land on their feet .
they are evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but in the tel@@ ev@@ ised transmission also another ca@@ ver@@ al aim : the World or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords .
the pur@@ pos@@ eful aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel as a bit ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing space of this .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline jum@@ per is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
the women &apos;s qualification and endurance will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , likewise at 1 : 00 p.m .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end customers as part of a afternoon block from 14.@@ 00 on both days .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the fear and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male U.S. Tur@@ ner suggested recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to come to air .
&quot; a Generation Prot@@ ects &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia clas@@ hed with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters have been killed during clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
over the past ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West , with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into ever more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shooting and killing dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to take a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , head of the Horn of Africa , the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa in Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror threats beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the des@@ erts of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in Central Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold on the power of the ruling coalition .
following a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the Er@@ it@@ rea border ; a struggle for this fragile , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden who have been forced more or less in recent years would benefit and re @-@ arm the tur@@ mo@@ il .
several factors explain why the bitter@@ ness of bitter@@ ness now explo@@ des after years of dr@@ ink@@ ness below the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones became more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially at protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies which hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians have stated that they gathered so much to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since ae@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high countries , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but even this is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are coordin@@ ating under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ ably dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was the Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 for 17 years .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly tempted to perceive early signs of dis@@ content and use special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively op@@ a@@ que reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 after thousands prot@@ ested against elections which , according to analysts , were apparently ple@@ dged by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if they were less than in the past months and this period of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this has not prevented the internal mis@@ fortune of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ city .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ a city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray became more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declared his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by att@@ acking that his multiple repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication gave rise to new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gi@@ bly with the American public .
it also brings his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event@@ ful phase , to have to explain in the peculiar position , statements that he could not have imagined .
after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump , referring to the claim on Thursday , insist@@ ed that he really did not intend to interpret that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump wrote that he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump wrote in a number of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation perfectly serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help mi@@ tig@@ ate the statement by rec@@ alling him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing to do with it .
the last storm of criticism came down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct his campaign on the economic situation due to falling exchange rates .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
signing on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech d@@ ull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m back to his defense .
at the end of July he pointed out strong criticism when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to call back on demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages will be taken by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr Tr@@ ump has adopted a more et@@ ched note , since his res@@ hap@@ ing values have continued to decline .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often bl@@ ames his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is focusing more attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades to the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent pron@@ ounc@@ ements , made great efforts to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CN@@ N interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it rear @-@ bro@@ kers , completely wrong , and that &apos;s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by subj@@ ecting the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of sitting on each of his words and taking action against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ologies than just yet another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idency .
once crow@@ ned by the price of the market , café comes back to Green@@ point
verb Cafe was a fo@@ ol@@ ed café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which one could pay only bar , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were displaced .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , replacing the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people took it as the last loss in a ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ bean wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ t and club is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also rein@@ vention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized verb Cafe last November opened in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old coffee bar , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide funds for a new outside office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot .
verb found the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese on the menu and there are gar@@ den@@ ers such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed through the Willi@@ am@@ sburg awards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the verb on a regular basis .
even after moving to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb had been closed , she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized it was in the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered in@@ vari@@ ably the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal is still receiving his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no gru@@ dge that the soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for bre@@ wing with the coffee @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will deal with their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point also accepted the café .
a new customer transl@@ ates the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he pre@@ fers to exhibit her soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ w@@ ed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a nearby building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for sophisticated Fi@@ fth Avenue delic@@ at@@ essen such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land ter@@ rap@@ ie soup .
his menu this day was slightly more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Good@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and is both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ e &apos;s last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of a food perspective in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard . &quot;
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ app@@ y snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the repor@@ ter ordered Hack@@ ney , this found the couple appropriate for a discussion about the food in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , meat lo@@ af lo@@ af and p@@ opp@@ y bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat che@@ ap@@ y that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts as they serve as a dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years prior to the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women were cooking for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the ways in which the country was going to be no longer the land of milk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central , ten@@ se issue for Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole was a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ using food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rarely servi@@ ced luxury .
peculiar compounds were tried out , as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious gr@@ ati@@ fication had priority over taste or even healthy cooking .
during her research for the book , which includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from that era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions don &apos;t fit together .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - varied the food habits of the country .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians , &quot; and the challenge of turning pamp@@ as such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historic delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude .
as he openly praised the simple I@@ owa Far@@ ming &apos;s kitchen in his kitchen , he fed like the million@@ aire man of the world to which he became .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated menu and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully un@@ realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt would perhaps have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had called him to take an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the guar@@ dian of a house@@ keeper showed no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting prepared . &quot;
many of the styles of the era of great depression to deal with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to foods .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how she could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bri@@ ck@@ man rec@@ alls : &quot; she actually made people ill . &quot;
there was the draft of the wind .
after the plates had been cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e emphasized a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe , the President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a modest name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone showed a little reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a stroke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a bom@@ bing attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil protection , which shows him during an 11 hour rescue from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war .

Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks mostly come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks only get offspring with 150 years .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters far .
only when it counts , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle embos@@ sed by slow@@ ness seems to be a patent for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ bach , at the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , comments this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evolutionary bi@@ ologist probably thought that Greenland would be st@@ ony .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland H@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
her slow pent@@ pent@@ ines , when they buried six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard , measured them with a transmitter .
the prey still makes this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they possibly hunt down sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ aver , who tor@@ ment from higher water @-@ layers downward .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was exactly 81 cm long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re was measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lin@@ sen@@ ic nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks notably had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempt yiel@@ ded large amounts of this radioactive element into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of Carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons attempt , so it might have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in their l@@ enti@@ le nucle@@ us all larger Greenland sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k might be 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign their length to an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res was probably at the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s hair with the multip@@ lication is obviously at least one and a half centuries of time .
this may also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no accident that such meth@@ y@@ al@@ em@@ as live mainly in icy waters .
the record holder so far , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland wh@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ agus .
later on , they mature - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often particularly large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources more in a long life .
the building site in the double pack
in the most recent session , the municipal council has been focusing on themes relating to construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee accepted Mayor Robert P@@ utz &apos;s message that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported living areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ ess and settlement issues have been clari@@ fied and the applications for surve@@ ying have been clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential building areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - expansion section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and former sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , volunteers can now announce themselves in the town hall , the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September session .
in order to be able to comply with requests for the settlement of further commercial enterprises , together with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan that was newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ sections .
in the under@@ time lar@@ n area , the field of commercial activity has been extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of the Main therefore has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether bank@@ ers may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been granted approval in Great Britain up to now .
that &apos;s why big US banks are using it .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibilities for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B risk group .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Luxembourg is home to a large fund branch , it also deteri@@ or@@ ates poor@@ ly in infrastructure as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
in addition , the town features easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not as easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there were 50 percent higher r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate in the River Main than on the River Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the Mer@@ cer corporate consultancy , the city stands in seventh place , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , the econom@@ ist .
the balance of forces also speaks for this : in London , according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead is receiving legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. federal judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. has been entitled to reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs incurred by her from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ st@@ C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ cks , including per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical actions .
in surve@@ ying the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. official Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reli@@ ance on the costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to co @-@ operate with Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs , which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck def@@ end@@ ant each other and claim ownership of laboratory work to which sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir was granted , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained complete control over the northern town of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) break through the city after the extraction of the remaining group of fighters that have buried themselves within the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were kept ho@@ stages by the fighters , said Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are implementing clean @-@ up operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s income earned 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal tax
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which sur@@ rendered to the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , chi@@ ef@@ ly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton answered almost $ 5.3 million in Rede@@ mption Ti@@ ars ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s publishing house for their ministry in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine of Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declar@@ ations for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s Camp@@ aig@@ n hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false statements and dec@@ lines in reference to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by the tax authorities as a basis for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Democrats nom@@ in@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ vis@@ er , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Cri@@ tics , among others also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding fortune , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ cans Tr@@ ump invites him to release his tax return .
on Thursday she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a scheme named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka asked for buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also under@@ gone a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return to the year 2007 .
the Clinton &apos;s , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid on average an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the 2015 Clin@@ tons tax return showed that they earned only USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most of the Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des , fire@@ works promote dance ani@@ as elephant protection
nature conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guy Foundation , who already had the idea of years ago , intensified its funding by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crop without hur@@ ting animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is world tel@@ eph@@ ones day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , although they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guy Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ mel@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chill@@ i powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition threshold .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom drops off with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust into the air .
a touch of right is usually sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last chance is a shi@@ pper that sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ work unit in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

however , the city council rejected the application for the construction of a new shop on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine river under construction .

Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots le@@ ashed a media watch after he had revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election because Arab guests were &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anno@@ y@@ ance at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the country &apos;s pres@@ election list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
seeking an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered more fur@@ y in the stage director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were app@@ alled and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the Internet where people called it a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ge in the alleged demands of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; feel ashamed , &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the clas@@ sy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct instruction &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code is now added .
police pus@@ hes tear gas and rubber bul@@ let against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public educational system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the use of rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be converted to save money .
some of the protest participants were gra@@ ff@@ led by gra@@ ff@@ iti on the temporary president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country has increased strongly , the ambassador announced .
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared with the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade recovery was achieved by supplying machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian Union represented about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses Wan@@ ted : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl exceeds
a rob@@ ber@@ y event was practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the Be@@ we XXL wine market at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark clothed persons , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the release of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver colored VW Golf .
the police don &apos;t share how much money has been captured .
the perpet@@ rators were to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres in size , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poor@@ ly view@@ able .
after the raid , the perpet@@ rators must be scanned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and have to be fled from the gravel parking lot located opposite the car park entrance , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
who made observations at the crime time ( at 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y , should report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer leisure
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the socio @-@ educational daily group / social group work of the child protection federation Nag@@ old with their super@@ vis@@ ors at their summer leisure time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet Lei@@ tw@@ är@@ dle Fun World , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the first week of the school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ ert with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
on the other side to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s tour in the world famous monastery .
the third excursion led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group enjoyed themselves at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and tar@@ nish .
children and car@@ ers were treated with their homemade food such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
workshops focused on creating beautiful gem@@ s made of beads and stones or made of wood of a Roman mill game .
other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of the journey home the sun was laugh@@ ing and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the altar boys from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch &apos;s St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage .
four stages were tackl@@ ed together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the Secretary of State of St. Anna decided to prepare and conduct a several day pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where in this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg Min@@ ster .
16 Min@@ is , of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the no@@ stri@@ ls of the sanctuary , went their way .
in the evening preceding the evening , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anne , blessed the pilgrims and par@@ ted the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
from Hor@@ b , there was a train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster unknown woman stood and so the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s Way from Münster res@@ ig@@ ned .
the single day tours were framed in the morning and evening , accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the min@@ is at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches always stopped to sing a song of specially compiled pilgrims song .
the par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers of the local par@@ ishes were at their disposal for the overnight stays .
at the stage destinations , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller were looking for a tasty and tonic dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after , the stage came to St. Peter , which was the most ar@@ du@@ ous stretch of road , but at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered at high heat and then be heard again .
the deser@@ ved reward was a common barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the 4th pilgri@@ m day in the impressive church of St. Peter we went on the final stage to Freiburg .
the Min@@ is , visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy .
God was thank@@ ed here with a small impulse .
at the evening mass in Münster the min@@ is arrived at the destination were welcomed by the operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau@@ cho metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int at the vel@@ o@@ drome in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself . the young@@ ster proudly made the legend when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y clin@@ ched the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London train world champi@@ onships in spite of Ho@@ ys &apos;s withdrawal .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the former Jamie staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement created a gap that ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner champi@@ onships in the qualification round , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , Hin@@ des fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y watched from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ da as they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
in the final round we set up an olymp@@ ic ord and beat the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ di admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track .
he later returned this statement and there was no obj@@ ection to Britain &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team over the last three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possible that he repeated Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on that day also Steve Red@@ hat , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and is going to go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Hin@@ di : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition , with which W@@ ig@@ gins will be in focus .
yesterday he was argu@@ ing with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding Women &apos;s Contest , which will be continued tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archives soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World Record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong platform team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of med@@ als .
after a truly remarkable representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
drama was played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ lying curtains as well as the retirement of gre@@ ats such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the melting shop of Port@@ land due to the cancellation of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places for workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all delivery contracts , as the delivering energy company announced .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a 20 @-@ year subsi@@ dy is scheduled for November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa area in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 work@@ places -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk during closure .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ oes as the melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Victoria .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry enam@@ el , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the mel@@ ted company of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation on the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by sm@@ el@@ ting , &quot; the company announced .
AG@@ L also stated that the contracts were called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; said the supplier of electricity .
all potential impact on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts was the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it signed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have entered into force in November this year , even though it is guilty of why it has res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of Port@@ land melt @-@ making in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consum@@ es around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kad@@ a@@ Love is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue
Antonio J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans , Kris is on the cover of the sought @-@ after September edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
Kendall , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Kad@@ esh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , cri@@ p@@ pled reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an J@@ en@@ ner family ( except for Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n &apos;s most popular show bi@@ z un@@ cles and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they all end up with a traditional twist : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é deal nearly every birthday present of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on girl at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow .
with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of car@@ dia has certainly begun .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim likes her as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the magazine issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most popular issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles a vide@@ ot@@ ape as a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertising from the 8@@ 32 pages of the walt@@ z ) .
the revelation of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were se@@ eping through prior to official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with its reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret Model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the mist@@ let@@ oe of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were bo@@ oming up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but travelling around on the mi@@ gh@@ test seems to pass by at the point .
Antonio J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is to be seen in reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal Convention Centr@@ es assign 16@@ 0,000 people every year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary needs are reported annually by the municipal law centers , while the industry is focusing on the effects of other Central abbrevi@@ ations on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ u@@ sions and similar - are rejected on their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly utili@@ sed , are ready for further reductions .
from June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of the district centers of Que@@ bec , James Far@@ rel@@ l , said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Centers has revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ ating the decision of the German government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been divor@@ ced by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to remove these short@@ cuts as soon as possible , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customer communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused of attrac@@ ting allegedly weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ activity after being told that their campaign manager for North Carolina in February directed a gun to a staff while they were traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in that state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i began to have waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before it realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the campaign , Earl Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drew a pist@@ ol , put his right hand finger on the de@@ duction , and held the run in Vinc@@ ente &apos;s knee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compl@@ aining about the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate had triggered a ri@@ ot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms and arms fans - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge should appoint judges .
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is Compl@@ aint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of due dili@@ gence and Philip on account of bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .

W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the government party SPD and CD@@ U are distinguished .
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could just continue to go@@ vern , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin .
but in both federal states the SPD would be the strongest party and thus have good chances to continue to make the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent in parliament for the first time .
despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag ( 8.@@ 7 per cent before ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent respectively .
according to the opinion of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD &apos;s opinion only came to 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it thus lag@@ ged behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives for the first time at 14 percent .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , by contrast , the pir@@ ates would be missing in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
the Nokia Communic@@ ator was introduced to the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty bul@@ ky .
the built @-@ in memory was at first eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would today suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with a minimum of 16 gigab@@ ytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was launched exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , fans can still buy the devices on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could send a lot for that standard : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser , al@@ beit tor@@ ment@@ ingly slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the cell phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today the market domin@@ ates providers who all came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is everyday life for many people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world .
some 1.4 billion devices , including Samsung and Apple , were sold by 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales with the tools are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry arose around the smartphone .
the crucial breakthrough on the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all easy to use via touch screen .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had a look .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to put the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , member of the Siemens Board of Human Resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we took a big effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we are already employing 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , creating 40,000 new jobs and putting an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ bling on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ yers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in am@@ using growth and bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways .
now they are ready to deliver a third walk@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time to direct this Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that make money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse play &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post , in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change coding regarding its advertisements to make it display block@@ ings the recognition of which part of the site advertising is to make it difficult to recognize .
but Ad@@ block announced that there was a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams &quot; spokes@@ man wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ f@@ ro battle between the clock@@ work open source community and the b@@ unk@@ ers has been under way since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has become involved in the struggle is a strong indication of how alar@@ ming display block@@ ers have become the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook &apos;s ad revenue .
the company has not changed it to desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a spokes@@ man shared .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of income so that Facebook appears to be worthwhile investment for such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ fer@@ ential Pool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to allow people to have more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block &apos;s new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the site that are not adverti@@ sed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control over people &apos;s hands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman in suspected suicide transfer on Swiss Highway &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night .
the police call for witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday was over@@ run by a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay down in the dark &apos; in an act of desper@@ ation &apos; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was over@@ run by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police , who invite these and every witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes utter@@ ed Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - when a person in the dark ran on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian gets on the motorway in the middle of the night as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the dangerous killing after having passed and killed a man who was on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and went un@@ conscious on the street , took judgment .
the Court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- ro@@ de in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; totally extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 44 .
NASA Kli@@ m@@ am@@ o@@ del : Venus once inhabited
Venus was probably hab@@ itable according to projections of a new NASA client model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have en@@ gen@@ dered Earth @-@ like conditions .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly revers@@ ed .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus is exposed to its day @-@ side of the sun almost two months , &quot; explained scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution suspected by planetary scientists .
although once believed to be inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billions years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away by the ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gene , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy re@@ acts as a coach of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association is immediately looking for a new trainer .
&quot; in the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs it and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the coach &apos;s vision and vice president Of Hock@@ ey Operations have to be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy had won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and to the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches featured a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell five points behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles with respect to the wages of North Sea workers are suspended , while all the parties of the dispute settle for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Wood Group oil field service strikes were carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks that will start at the beginning of next year in order to restart the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has shortened the rates to its Con@@ tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent , due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s rating will follow a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the space required to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell released tens of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ a@@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes ever held in the North Sea for one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea are expected to be around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the con@@ stellation P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the con@@ stellation rotate to different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods are associated with planetary development .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years distant from the earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now the fastest ones .
at peak rot@@ ational rates these mat@@ uring stars exp@@ el large amounts of star win@@ ches .
as these winds drive through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star tor@@ tures , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- such as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , taking larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the P@@ lei@@ ades &quot; ballet , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
as the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
there is still much ahead of us , which we would like to know more about how the How , When and Why Stars will slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang their &quot; dance shoes &quot; so to speak .
in three newspaper reports Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rot@@ ational rates , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star emerges
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal notice , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August at the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature in a ten @-@ year contract earned him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back with performance for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle ste@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es has made several mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values .
nevertheless , the 41 year old should not be included in the rest hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; admitted to have taken forbidden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have been receiving power @-@ promoting agents for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 matches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez then sou@@ ff@@ is@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have won the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez frequently had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; added Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , was inspired by the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ ri@@ vals Boston red so@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; they sang the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team .
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Dest@@ in@@ sky are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lifting Adrian Dest@@ in@@ sky from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a learned ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese flo@@ ats Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle ski@@ er Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Dest@@ in@@ sky have been positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the beginning of the already critical field of athle@@ tics competitions , these news come to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de was already proven last Sunday which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International sports court CA@@ S confirmed the exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have taken part in the courses over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association considers the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Court of Justice CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S , is responsible for the sanc@@ tioning of the athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news se@@ eps through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; said the female ath@@ lete .
according to the report , it is alleged that the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O will act in the forbidden substance .
for the time being Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended , according to the B@@ NT , the B @-@ rehear@@ sal should have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v received criticism immediately with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation may not participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the fall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Dest@@ in@@ sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both deny taking , however , both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the track starts , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF was not allowed to start the entire Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , while also the country nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the previous off@@ ences in China also ensured fierce debates between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion , Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium more than 200 m fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focus of a discussion with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , Sun had a positive test on the stimul@@ ant tri@@ meth@@ azi@@ one in Chinese champi@@ onships , but only had to sit down for a three @-@ month ban .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de gro@@ uting h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
developers of black@@ mailing malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware protection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , in part several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ran@@ som@@ ware squee@@ zing .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som required by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the offen@@ ders specify their black@@ mail software to react to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to black@@ out ran@@ som is much higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was sc@@ ary quickly over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the victim &apos;s computer , it searches specifically for recently changed files , such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as to archive images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail@@ ers .
to get the final turn code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , firms deal with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ dingly higher if a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of German firms affected sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business operation completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks whose patients could be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpet@@ rators in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers at F @-@ Secure have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain to their victims per chat how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies need to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share the work , explained safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the antivirus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
the malware kits have been created by installing malware , consulting and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scope of supply includes a matching tool so that minor configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers are looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the boards underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and arran@@ ges another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the criminals normally use sp@@ amm@@ ers with dis@@ semination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known among many companies that better safeguard their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful exhaus@@ tion alone , the perpet@@ rators thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in the future , the perpet@@ rators will also be able to take on completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the Def@@ con h@@ acker conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators are blocking an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and the versatility of a mini van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work closely at any location .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top is slightly down there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a chin chair and offer storage space that is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
but he should do a bit more quietly with his work .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the city emergency brake assist ( operates at speeds of 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane departure assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during manoeu@@ v@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote lighting assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent sli@@ der respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
however , full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine starting from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .

a airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) ar@@ gues that liability is only possible in case of danger that are typical of air traffic .
at the fall , the plain@@ ti@@ ff broke down a knee cap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
illness : when paid by the organis@@ er
sick holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have proven to see the same symptoms .
in the case of the case , a family was seriously ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their vacation .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective treatment plant that allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family felt that the journey would have been flaw@@ ed - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the wastewater treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organizers only learned about it shortly before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that sea@@ water was al@@ right .
he did not viol@@ ate his obligation to provide information , so the sentence .
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion - belongs to the general risk of life .
out of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , said many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber minded and resol@@ utely at the same time react to acts of terrorism .
certainly : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if criminal off@@ ences have to leave the country faster , they increase security and strengthen the consent of the people for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a realization of proposals until the Bundestag election 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ scale division over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism should be punished once more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance is expected to improve , the rights of arms to be revised in such a way that the acquisition of weapons in the Internet is particularly difficult .
the most recently discussed field of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors should be maintained in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the threat to citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , looking at mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against ac@@ tion@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear @-@ sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double nationality .
he considers that a general prohibition of complete attri@@ tion is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
one cannot forbi@@ d everything that one re@@ jects , and I oppose the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
it is possible to talk about rules , for example in road traffic , or for witnesses against court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green editor Sim@@ one Peter repro@@ ached the minister , he wanted to simulate a new anti @-@ terror p@@ act and act of action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of stock@@ ings and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring the people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway network
it st@@ rolls regularly on the surrounding road - here a picture of November .
but that is to change : the right of law shall be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in traffic jams when driving over the motorway via Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 @-@ 17 August ) , the road construction is extended by 700 meters in the area between Hammer Road and Wes@@ er Straße .
drivers can then go directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
the big advantage is that the traffic is split in an early stage so that the overall schedule is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district council of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ log sp@@ ends up to the bridge across the Alber@@ slo@@ g path and sometimes even beyond .
the reason is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the descent of Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , the traffic is only diver@@ ted on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be disman@@ tled well over three quarters of a century .
the reason for this was that the static calculations showed that the bridge had no longer the required load capacity in order to take the heavy @-@ load traffic two @-@ lane .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated traffic jam will continue , the responsible regional company cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remainder of the remaining period until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal regulation , the state company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because it could be expected with disabilities .
traffic will be continued on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Events for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Forest School visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s Home has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the young theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the little house .
since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the framework of this project .
most you@@ ths of the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia , and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , such as the press release of the young theatre Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg in Spra@@ chen@@ hall , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , teenagers with and without refugee and migration background should have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music between the ages of 14 and 20 .
offers for children and families in theatre play and theat@@ rical communication are in the planning stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association is counting on many classes wanting to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hopes for better weather
the weather has made the star schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany a das@@ h through the bill on Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the Chair@@ person of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the star scales are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name , because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing Night : tips On Sle@@ ep Dis@@ orders
in the evening , one walks around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep in the morning before the alarm @-@ ring@@ ing .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and various causes can ruin them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter neither eß , member of the board of the German society for sleep dis@@ appointment and sleeping medicine .
what you understand for the time being is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an intru@@ sion and sleeping disorder .
especially the sleeping feel many people feel inadequate or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , a board member of the German House Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
not in@@ frequently is sleep disorder an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is especially frequent in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can sleep badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to sal@@ ute you about everyday problems and worries .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , be advised .
the impair@@ ment can look very different : tired , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or headache .
in order to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or even drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is hardly any sleeping physician there in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
for this reason , one should first turn to the family doctor in case of sleeping problems , advised the Dead Agent .
it can be investigated with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the sleep laboratory and what happens ?
for the study in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise , for example , with snor@@ ing with breathing replac@@ ements , in case of day@@ time fatigue , for sleep trans@@ duc@@ ers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
it is not really necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ oning , you go to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose e@@ ye@@ wear , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera stands on the ceiling of the sleeping @-@ ends .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few adjusting screws on which you can set for better sleep .
shoot counts : regular bed@@ - and down@@ time , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not good at all .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 , he obtained gold for the first time at the World Cup in Doh@@ a . at the same time he exhibited his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself via Facebook in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates standing in the criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle King 15@@ 0.000 € nobody should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system in the swimming sport is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler should have been reported to Germany ( NA@@ DA ) nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before the World Cup / OS by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger who meanwhile operates an ice cream .
airport : baggage is det@@ ained by baggage
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bag and baggage ste@@ els as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 hrs , civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport discovered a gang , which was known to the polic@@ emen from past anti @-@ theft off@@ ences .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July and had a joint , work@@ able and very professional approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialists of the Special Police Council , 34 , can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves who have entered Germany especially for the removal of criminal off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had captured over 15,000 euros in total .
old buildings , a few Lin@@ den trees , a remnant of cob@@ ble@@ stones in between : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not look like this at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a fres@@ co @-@ painted kinder@@ garten and a bike path .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone has spra@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , it is already being built : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , will be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , in the meantime the inhabitants have rental contracts , on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin In@@ sen@@ ator Henkel devoted a number of times for a hard action by the police against the project , calling the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 , the premises on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police on site for three weeks , closed off parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers removed from the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents go for walks with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others conver@@ se vor@@ m Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and nur@@ sery schools .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here , are above all anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the care of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , which mostly wanted police protection from the v@@ and@@ ali@@ ent left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police make up between land@@ owners and their neighbors , obviously does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood , which also today has a low average income compared to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty .
residential buildings and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Street close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Mainz was ev@@ acu@@ ated under large police regulations in a real road battle , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and partly still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ s from all over the world over the past few years : people from the GDR times and former occup@@ ants are now sharing their neighbourhood with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them at mol@@ ded pan@@ es or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with color @-@ bags .
no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; left autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like body injury show statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the criminal off@@ ences tend to make damage that tends to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
in@@ security cannot be mentioned for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years .
as for violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , who have not been that .
even the famous burning cars have no longer existed in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately moved to the Riga street - and remained .
that is why it was so important to her that local residents got their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all of a sudden claimed the sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former building gaps that crowd the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - here they live rather people who are not so well contaminated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone never list@@ ens to someone ?
fru@@ stration is on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for drawn @-@ out genes that anno@@ y about color bombs : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who draw near should be aware of this - just like someone who pul@@ ls in a pub neighborhood , can complain poor@@ ly about noise .
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is New Refu@@ ge@@ e Repres@@ entative
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the management team for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees himself as a contact person for all stakeholders : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is here , the boring wool mil@@ k@@ sow , which above all has a problem .
thus some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ing than rather on the multitude of demanding tas@@ ks@@ - meant , meant when the administration wanted to write out the job .
we were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , we@@ aving a hil@@ arious wo@@ ollen mill .
but administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
above all , it &apos;s about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ our@@ able and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers stand in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential premises .
the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the coun@@ cils to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
it doesn &apos;t work so far , if you depend on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings have to be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is called beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but it is not only with apartments .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro job and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be f@@ ath@@ omed or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive outside effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sport , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
this means that administration and volunteers are also involved here .
it is important that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain to the refugees that it will take and they can make sense of time , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are problems as well , &quot; said customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people with nothing at all . &quot; therefore the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do they fear radic@@ alisation after the latest incidents , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client says clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they are afraid that the assass@@ ins will completely re@@ vo@@ ke them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
therefore , the main and honorary officials have to look for activities in the region and in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the process , they always have in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , the politics ab@@ h@@ or .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher has already been utili@@ sed to integrate the existing human beings in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicopter sought
the police helicopter flew various areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men have viol@@ ently entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.@@ m .
the inhabit@@ ant surprised the two , and hit the bar@@ k in the escape .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , well mas@@ ked , both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ die pul@@ lis .
they fled towards the inner city .
the police used several strip occup@@ ations as well as a police helicopter .
the search went without success .
perhaps the unknown were in fact falling close to the apartment or in their escape .
