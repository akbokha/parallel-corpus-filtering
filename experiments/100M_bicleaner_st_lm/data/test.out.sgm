<seg id="1">Golfer Langer gets the sport pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experience on the horse is clear.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer and some colleagues searched for a little change with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "gold Pyramid of the World" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted home to the feeding troughs in the fast gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this speed, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And with that the riding career then ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself run with his family through the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even snatch for photo-purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid handed over to the man from Anhausen in the framework of a small gala the Golden League Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sympathetic sportsman doesn't lack the awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, silver bay leaf, Champions-tour-player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already rebuked him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th Winner of the Pyramid of the World is a long one.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "says Langer," "" "because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades Langer has promoted the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros the same.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US Masters winner was added to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The award-winners include athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, Turner Eberhard Giengen, the fennel Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Rudder Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of those sportsmen had come to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's All about the Money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - they want Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidential candidates are undivided in terms of taxation and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, over the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wanted to control the economy to death and regulate his death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, contends Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drive back regulators massively, and he stands strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfill certain tasks, it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes would be raised for the rich, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost verbatim." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate deplores the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strongly rejected by the state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, party-internal discussions might come to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "the differences in energy and climate policy are more clear." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-ramp up coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand the renewable energy with its investment programme and demands:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazical trade agreements, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, the United States do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid better, like Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of US $7.25 is a starvation wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rattle, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand is Trump who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics disregarded him so that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand from the rich, is entitled to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fowl.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised quarters for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs developed the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>

<seg id="40">Also in Swabia alone fled women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new employment campaigns in their disputes concerning a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated Room of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed irresistible and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something terrible had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a radiant, lasting audacity from Putin showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the launching of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the veto will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for all.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from the President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was relieved last month in a failed coup d "état of almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television predicted cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti put it in the following way:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West, as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the ongoing resentment on the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin, which is keen to benefit from the cool sentiment and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian Head of State earned a bonus for calling for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">For Moscow, this is a matter of course, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an analyst once describing the "alliance of outsiders": two countries that are driven from the West and feel badly treated and are now fading.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played its role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours on initial talks both presidents met at the press conference that they had not even touched on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey rejected the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State talk at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin scorns chief of staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of the strictest confidence of Putin many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed as Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that without stating grounds" "" "Putin ordered the release of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been a deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that he later was the chief executive officer and Chief of Staff of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said about his appointment to Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Will the smiling faces convince you?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was, for a long time, one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidant and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff retires at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once touted as a potential president, would once again lead Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - placate items for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another closest allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North-deck of the QueensMountain cross country to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closing of the" "" "deck blower" "", "which are approaching completion for each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensland cross country." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete shot for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high-end and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North turmdeck located in the expansion, we had to close the gap on the north or landside.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards with an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate because the tolerances on which the team was working were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "the SPD and Greens mean:" "" "investors should be put into duty more strongly in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD is proposing a" "" "housing concept for housing" "" "at the next session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should actually build the favorable housing?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD leader Christoph Vimann says:" "" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments will have to exhibit as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the affordable housing can also be found in the inventory.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big dispute in the town hall was, according to Bratmann:" "" "how to deal with investors who want to build on private areas?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of housing as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions of euros and still needs to be financed, is to provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, says Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible to investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, as Bratmann, it initiates a sharpening of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is still not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of further around 1,300 cheap homes, whose funding will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, as the planning policy spokesperson, Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of getting apartments back to the price.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West City.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of the year, Fristen are running in the West City.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 habitation could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">For if the number of social housing in the West city is increased again drastically, one removes itself from the aim of so-called confusion.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no concentration of socially disadvantaged people in only a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a chase for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside, but rather prefer spending their leisure time staring on screens has been complained by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially on TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I naturally refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created.</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many of the phenomena of pop culture, interest declined slightly prior to the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go has more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when it was younger, joined the turkey and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the USA, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person puts back every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of subsequent people who train 30 minutes each day, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just looks at the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "" "met deaf ears because many public messages are dull to health and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are gruesome game spoons, which must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with activism in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on whole line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast went on Thursday for the title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the headlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women of Simone Biles do gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a majority and the fifth, while solidifying her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey had come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American Sisters Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-battle event of women at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday while she served as exclamation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator, Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although it insisted that during their long journey to the top, never having planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gymnasium, where Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has lost no more competition, a series of victories that will hold as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafa decreased by two turns, the picture was blurred.</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beams and ground urns - in which Biles holds the world title - lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She resumed with 15,433 on the Swedish bar again - and with a 15,933 on the floor there was still another.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when she expected her grandson - a pure form of formality - and tears poured into pices brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal was in a Tiebrake an Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "Grandma," had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her floor exercise she threw down to the public kisses, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a weapon, while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle, to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police told that triple murder was not the result of a predator, because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that shooting triggered the investigators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in hispanic farming areas within four months and two others were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house," said Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed that the suspects used several vehicles including a brown Nissant from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and that the same murderer was committed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting that was aimed at an empty pick-up truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it was assumed that it was the factory of serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the ladies' olympionship in the gymnastics and this for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I joined each summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally mirrors the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and jubelte.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple championships of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymnastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see exercise classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all beating the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have only four men in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and Turner primarily come up in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics lie in well-to-do suburbs who can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long lasting commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to aun countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and accessible exercise.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my trainers 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will make thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team spirit and thank you, she motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office due to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political Correctness has led to widespread polling in Muslim communities ignoringly being ignored, as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town councils to ignore evidence of electoral abuse on account of" "" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an antagonist politician, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set off tapes outside of electoral cabins in order to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is recommended that voters should have an identification card to prove their identity when polling elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter simply has to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger if they release their vote in order to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this serves not only against electoral fraud but should also protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud that goes with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets Electoral Channel in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a Special Tribunal decided that the incumbent mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be relieved of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "the Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "" "in cynical fashion" "" "and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic charges." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of imitation in which one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed in particular alarm to the fraudulent letter elections - with the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including leading ID to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the Elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="22">Sir Eric described 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists manipulate mail-selection documents to stop "elections."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires harsher registration checks to prevent the electoral list to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters about your identity before choosing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given up her voice to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible.</seg>

<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees rule out the rule that voters go to the cabin alone.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright schabt for a guide book his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller subdued his immune system and stranglehold of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his train on a euro note, a banister on Piccadilly Circus, a sink on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the departure of each object he used a luminaire to show himself and us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to detach the sink-button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left behind what he was tasked with, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling around the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at railway stations to flushing buttons of toilets, the task proved definitely to be under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample stripe showed a lumintimeter count of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilette that he refused to depose after its luminaires were over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 units.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the advantages of probiotics at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorings that ended with saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say that - I've lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilette that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to blame them and others, with whom this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria especially with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asociale family left their social apartment after a deletion of £50,000 because they terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Treppcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were filled with gaping holes, wood panels were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it is now living in private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for home management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is probably considered to be not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror they had inflicted on the family consisted of street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, strife and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skelby, 47, whose name was on the lease, in June got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour.</seg>

<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing led her and her partner violently by the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw them.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, stated that it would have abused the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Trash and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community house</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family as a deletion is always the last step taken into consideration by Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and sent us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="6">A Kenyan function had announced that the former Sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic Village gave a Urine sample under the name of the 800 metre runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the Kenyan team leader by doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Association has requested the IOC for information on the case to exert its own investigation into an IAAF spokesman.</seg>

<seg id="18">Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency exerted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 in the morning and end only at 8pm, there is always praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they have done everything pretty shaky," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jetliner." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">The conciliation of those responsible for the construction work is also commended, for example when it comes to setting up residence permits.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has resumed, the traffic situation within the town has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens now can drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pass through the village seems to be going back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were sometimes significant complaints," said the deputy head of the project, Florian King, responsible for the rehabilitation management of the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachlerstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping lanes were looking for and more familiar to their navigation system than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">Which led to some deceased truck stops in residential areas.</seg>

<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the street is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales breaks allows everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants did" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="34">He dismissed half of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a firm with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location at the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something has been handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family clientele comes back at the end of the rehabilitation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buy records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Solitary middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hurry to comment under the pseudonym Non Alleenary Coverage of Middle-Aged with arduous insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed resurgence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in Millennials, which would welcome the news of physical objects, but due to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no horror through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record salesmen retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and graceful before I stop, hold my hands and say something better like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although Soho's heart is slowly lost in its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent vendors were based - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I'm from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (number of data: eight men middle-aged, a woman, probably around 20) is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buying items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I've probably been a little too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" "" "I don't smoke and I don't drink too much." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets have to apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub, people who have heard about comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have conducted, people tend to get rid of their collection as a rule around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom in partisans of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers contacted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar silencers, objects that evoke happy reminiscences.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is an easy way to mentally concern yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a staff flees from a stack of plates." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point in the news report I would probably look very worried as I leaf through a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came up until recently and said:" I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-less, less music-wise.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Opp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and women of middle aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts is the latest synthesizer and sextant pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strangely enough, but naïve psychic traumas are hard to find if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a couple of minutes and looks at the variety of panels for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-shopping as a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives away with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While giving the impression of daring the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping themselves together for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov are right, they are not taken into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They certainly do not spend their Thursday mornings with their sleeves through record stores of Berwick Street and the sheets through plates, while they flatly avoid the staring look of an awkward, 30-year-old false Moderator, resting on the shoulders of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be authorised to submit 72 temporary businesses where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energydrinks, sell hairdressers or to sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would involve a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also noted that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely to feed people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting places between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the tears was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is usually operated and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids' Café intact.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that" "" "the closure" "" "for these children would be a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two relief organisations help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants cherished on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of newcomers over the summer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Here comes the Enforcement Trailer</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adjust to the next generation of speed knives: in different federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flashes are tested, which are intended to be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used at accident areas, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to building bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that speed limits are observed with a stationary speed camera.</seg>
<seg id="5">A permanent mobile structure can, however, be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery keeps five days in an uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across several tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as drive ban according to time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a state-of-the-art condition you can pull the trailer according to manufacturer with every car with trailer hitch.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and by the way also shot-proof outer shell.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the glitter from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to the information provided by Vitronic in different federal states and is now also used.</seg>
<seg id="13">Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: recently, France has ordered 100 items, after an order of 150 units last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7th Rugby in the final on Thursday evening led to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were struck with a result of 43-7 in the Pomodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in handling, side-Stepping, back-back, line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept away by the not too bad silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England of Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and let the attacks clutch their bases from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you were running in running buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau crossed over the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A scorching Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it just stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute scored a Touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the start of the game and there was still a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided over additional weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still cores.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for a long time in favour of the South Sea sultanans, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle rang, the Fijis hugged and GB crushed in crushing into the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals of 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired by the fight with the coach's cancer for rudder victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than with these games and that wants to be called something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only the two who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was present when they rowed to the second Olympiagold in the two without tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of the British sport, who laid down such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.000 inexhaustible effort, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletins gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental progress that make the difference and nobody was more instrumental than the trainer, who did not know 30 months ago whether he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operated and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right concept in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve waking morning talking about something more than usual and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, who was captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>

<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with it.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams started to start from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">This would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "the work of the" "" "Veite steingruppe" "" "was" "" "exemplary Bavarian" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was a member of the staff for 31 years, stands for 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retiring at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water purveyor of the Veite steingruppe with headquarters in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 towns and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member congregations are the congregations of Kirchstätter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Bauntah.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a waterman in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the German Unification Association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, planning of the budget, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," "" "said the chairperson." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, it called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and reparation of the farmers, the redevelopment of a central computer control system (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no stalemate and there have always been innovations, because water is the most important food for life and drinking water.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has fought with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association downright as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veite steingruppe on nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received a great deal of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful knot.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he described the well-building and the restructuration of the Zweckers association.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Optics for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens arising from the sector from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains at the liberation of the renewable energy environment in the existing plants for so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Freitagungen).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry was facing an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this too will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on electricity generation.</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation further aggravated when the world's largest producer of producer China threw massive steel into the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, affixed import duties have an effect on import-steel, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have increased.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated more.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp finally did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers are cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl shared on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short rise in May, the manufactured amount returned after the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production is two percent lower than the previous year's figure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing does seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she occupied the subject of music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more vivid, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good about her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors in several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says from the German seniors league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Seniors train deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who challenges his lungs regularly gets out of the dolls in everyday life too.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the German Association of Senior Citizens Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher value, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia sufferers decline with long reclining happenings.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, a special performance is required for the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, Hackler believes.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, he advises Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound comes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, you can simply join them.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also have views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the Church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize in the attacks a pattern which is typical of the Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist rebellion or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>

<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is sitting behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police abandoned their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around major government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are still smaller bombings, but most of them are not directed against tourists.</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution laid out by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This has a great impact on the military during the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to foment chaos while the country was heading towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, is committed to restoring the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water system Neudorf / Reuth / Welfare 3.44 instead of previously 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azure 3,64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in AzVillage, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a translucent calculation, the waste water price in AzVillage will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Roshäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that there were underwear for these sewage plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities at a cost-coverable manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welthiessen, Neudorf, Reuth, Aztec, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As administrative manager Herbert Schmidt presented the body, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also overlappings from the previous calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the serious fee increases with the fact that all three sewage systems are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water injection that varies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenditures for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water supply in all three plants is easily retrograde.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the past calculation period, all three plants were not least due to their age refurbishment and repair expenditure to a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in AzVillage is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welthiessen, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt referred to the fact that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the waste water system Aztecs.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Welthahl pumping station, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be removed, the sewage sludge was removed and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to be able to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still below the current level at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water losses in the three plants, expenses for operation and maintenance are "fully swept through."</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt, the market community of great entertainment costs in the waste water systems, has been spared over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to be precarious in the long run according to stone houses, especially since the supply area of the sewage disposal association Friesenbachtal cannot be expanded by these facilities, because these facilities are deficient.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is not sensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, snapshots allow about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that has already borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein color paintings.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All false entrants reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past snapshots have critically drawn criticism in which they were accused that the app would promote blackface foe or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it proposed a filter to some users this week, which gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics knew a racist caricature of Asians - "jaundice."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have turned off the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company had an excuse: the filter was meant to pay tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism recalled the injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely spread across the photos, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and mildly said unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not properly secured, but that the yellow face has been dragged into the debilitating extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could assume more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "when one of Snapchats filters an image that is insulting to a user," "" "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case," "" "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on media and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the placement practices of snapshots.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu was critical of the large part white, only male leadership and ended their article with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said Chinesich-american Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left the Snapchat largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it refused to discuss the cultural background of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel responsible, concentrating on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>

<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Committee of the Army Committees, Secret Service Committees, and the budget commissioner, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence gathering, typically stunted by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly drew up a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on the spot and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in the Centcom range from the top to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports, it shows how analysts face pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom associate publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin already in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings, while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, in some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments regarding ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "said the highest ranking Democrat of the Committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "injected Morality under Analyst and" "" "gave an excessive amount of space for different opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of the White House intervention in the Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's General Inspector, who were received after complaints from Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense have welcomed a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State evokes disputes from more than ten years ago, as a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a scripture about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and gave little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, according to government agencies, the team led by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, since these temporary refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centres damaliger Commandlshaber, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for its overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">The US winning fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK before</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two doors for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not among the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">But she knows that: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in her group with the Britons in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory over Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of them will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will move the strong Dutch slightly longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, as always the game may go out on Saturday, the American women have caused a surprising turbulence due to their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up at Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things into a better one.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," "" "said Bam." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the workaround in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to wander the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the gate in the first half of the game with a backstop from the near area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India went into play without winning the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a sprint with the flat ball through the left flank, then moved to the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to give the American female a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the US, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to record a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro will feel steady and inescapable, a fast-paced easel between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed down from the arm archers to the triathlete to the swimmer to the gymnast.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversations in the coffee shop without hearing About Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a black gull with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, structured by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognized: pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparsely aware that many of them, I had questioned, didn't know that it was an Olympic report anyway.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete who made it to the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians have a tendency to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschule than for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a veteran enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonistic trembling of his never-ending bounce - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, real and salts) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to version, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, upwards and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but in the televised transmission also another caveral aim: the World or the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as a bit tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing space of this.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and endurance will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, likewise at 1: 00 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end customers as part of a afternoon block from 14.00 on both days.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the fear and the objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner suggested recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to come to air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a Generation Protects" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia clashed with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of thousands of protesters have been killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shooting and killing dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to take a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa in Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the deserts of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in Central Africa." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold on the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the Eritrea border; a struggle for this fragile, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden who have been forced more or less in recent years would benefit and re-arm the turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why the bitterness of bitterness now explodes after years of drinkness below the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones became more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies which hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians have stated that they gathered so much to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since aeons the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian high countries, prospered in politics and economy while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are coordinating under one umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairably dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray who account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly tempted to perceive early signs of discontent and use special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil was in 2005 after thousands protested against elections which, according to analysts, were apparently pledged by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed even if they were less than in the past months and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the internal misfortune of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amhara city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray became more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr. Abdi," "" "is a very thin tightrope walk." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declared his claim Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his multiple repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification gave rise to new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligibly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow combatants who endeavour to take protection during an eventful phase, to have to explain in the peculiar position, statements that he could not have imagined.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump, referring to the claim on Thursday, insisted that he really did not intend to interpret that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump wrote that he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump wrote in a number of interviews, he meant the accusation perfectly serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help mitigate the statement by recalling him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism came down on Mr. Trump, while he tried to direct his campaign on the economic situation due to falling exchange rates.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Signing on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm back to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he pointed out strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to call back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages will be taken by his fans as they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction falls." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has adopted a more etched note, since his reshaping values have continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he often blames his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is focusing more attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal comrades to the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent pronouncements, made great efforts to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CNN interview.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr. Giuliani to the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it rear-brokers, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by subjecting the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of sitting on each of his words and taking action against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he mocked the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumps's apologies than just yet another proof that he was unsuitable for the Presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a fooled café in Williamsburg, in which one could pay only bar, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue store were displaced.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie business, replacing the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people took it as the last loss in a rifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabbean wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is exempt and club is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized verb Cafe last November opened in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new club has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing staff of the old coffee bar, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide funds for a new outside office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>

<seg id="19">There are sandwiches with bacon and cheese on the menu and there are gardeners such as capers and sauced onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>

<seg id="26">Even after moving to Greenpoint, she would take the path.</seg>

<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and is both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of a food perspective in her book "97 Orchard."</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snappy snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered Hackney, this found the couple appropriate for a discussion about the food in the era of great depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, meat loaf loaf and poppy bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheapy that stretches the ingredient.</seg>

<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have settled in the stomach as lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years prior to the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women were cooking for male rims and it was served freshly baked pâté for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "" "a Square Meal" "" "shows the ways in which the country was going to be no longer the land of milk." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when food was a central, tense issue for Americans," "" "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole was a "wonderful way of reusing food leftovers," Brickman noted, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for many years, became a rarely serviced luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar compounds were tried out, as a calorie-rich and nutritious gratification had priority over taste or even healthy cooking.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at noon," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelman continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions don't fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - varied the food habits of the country.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians," and the challenge of turning pampas such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a celebration of historic delicacies." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the response of the government to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover Lass-me-cake-eating attitude.</seg>

<seg id="37">"" "" "" "he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," "" "said Coe." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated menu and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt would perhaps have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had called him to take an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the guardian of a housekeeper showed no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting prepared. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the styles of the era of great depression to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country returned to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to foods.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of brickman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "she had a real fear of wasting food," "" "said Coe." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Brickman recalls: "she actually made people ill."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the draft of the wind.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks mostly come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it counts, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle embossed by slowness seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "by a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness" "", "Alexander Scheuerbach, at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, comments this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist probably thought that Greenland would be stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland Harks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow pentpentines, when they buried six animals in front of Svalbard, measured them with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">The prey still makes this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They possibly hunt down sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadaver, who torment from higher water-layers downward.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland's sharks which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was exactly 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimetre was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the linsenic nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks notably had a lot of carbon-14 in the lenticular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempt yielded large amounts of this radioactive element into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, the lentil nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of Carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempt, so it might have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lentile nucleus all larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark, while the record shark might be 392 years old with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign their length to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland's hair with the multiplication is obviously at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This may also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no accident that such methyalemas live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The record holder so far, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">Later on, they mature - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerbach." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources more in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots leashed a media watch after he had revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-election because Arab guests were "requested" according to an employee. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," made his annoyance at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where in this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg Minster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis, of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the nostrils of the sanctuary, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening preceding the evening, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anne, blessed the pilgrims and parted the Pilgrim's blessing.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint at the velodrome in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself. the youngster proudly made the legend when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy clinched the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London train world championships in spite of Hoys's withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the former Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement created a gap that kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy winning - and Skinner championships in the qualification round, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, Hindes fell short, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinda as they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round we set up an olympic ord and beat the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 at the Kenny and Hoys side, Hindi admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later returned this statement and there was no objection to Britain's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "said:" "" "it feels like the whole UK flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny, it is in the realm of the possible that he repeated Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on that day also Steve Redhat, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and is going to go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "said Hindi:" "" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were further good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition, with which Wiggins will be in focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he was arguing with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding Women's Contest, which will be continued tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archives soon of Milngavie in World Record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong platform team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly remarkable representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama was played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and bullying curtains as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces for workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all delivery contracts, as the delivering energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 20-year subsidy is scheduled for November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa area in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 workplaces -direct and indirect - could be at risk during closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to dominoes as the melt consumes around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry enamel, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melted company of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation on the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by smelting," the company announced.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL also stated that the contracts were called "hedging transactions," which should have entered into force in November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," said the supplier of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts was the" "" "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force in November this year, even though it is guilty of why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of Portland melt-making in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually consumes around 600 MW and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity.</seg>

<seg id="2">Antonio Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans, Kris is on the cover of the sought-after September edition of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "wrote Kadesh." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), crippled reality video showing the entire Kardashyan Jenner family (except for Rob and Caitlyn's most popular show biz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they all end up with a traditional twist: they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché deal nearly every birthday present of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon girl at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of cardia has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendal's big sister Kim likes her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most popular issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles a videotape as a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising from the 832 pages of the waltz).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were seeping through prior to official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there were clearly more" "" "celebrities who like" "" "as" "" "models, celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With its reality TV history Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the mistletoe of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were booming up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But travelling around on the mightest seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Antonio Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawfords daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>

<seg id="3">The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "ordini began to have waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before it realised that" "" "that would not happen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "the leader of the campaign, Earl Philip," "" "drew a pistol, put his right hand finger on the deduction, and held the run in Vincente's knee," "" "said Bordini in his indictment." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">After complaining about the local and regional campaign management, Bordini stated that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "weapons must not be fired to cause harm," "" "said Bordini." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">The accusation came only two days after the Republican presidential candidate had triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - firearms and arms fans - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and judge should appoint judges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trumps's campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bordinis Complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and Philip on account of bodily injury and permanent psychological damage.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18) considerable losses for the government party SPD and CDU are distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition in the north could just continue to govern, this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">But in both federal states the SPD would be the strongest party and thus have good chances to continue to make the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was only slightly ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left came to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent in parliament for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite slight losses, the Greens hesitated again in the Schwerin Landtag (8.7 per cent before).</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP were not represented in the Landtag with 3 percent respectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the opinion of the Berlin Chamber of Deputies, the SPD's opinion only came to 23 percent (2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">It thus lagged behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would be represented at the House of Representatives for the first time at 14 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, by contrast, the pirates would be missing in contrast to 2011.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Nokia Communicator was introduced to the market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good at hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty bulky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was at first eight Megabytes, which would today suffice for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with a minimum of 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was launched exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, fans can still buy the devices on the internet, but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as" "" "office in western pocket format" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Indeed, the new mobile phone could send a lot for that standard: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML-browser, albeit tormentingly slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we found a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything has changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The cell phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market dominates providers who all came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and everywhere online, this is everyday life for many people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some 1.4 billion devices, including Samsung and Apple, were sold by 555 million units alone.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales with the tools are around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This includes the well-running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the meantime, a whole industry arose around the smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="31">The crucial breakthrough on the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007, at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones on the Mac-World.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's triumphant success began, and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had a look.</seg>
<seg id="35">They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Saws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "we all have to learn to put the Smartphone away," "" "said Janina Ball, member of the Siemens Board of Human Resources." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we took a big effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we are already employing 10,000 new apprentices, creating 40,000 new jobs and putting an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blambling on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-flyers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in amusing growth and bequeathed a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequented walkways.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third walkway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">London's 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post, in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktopside would change coding regarding its advertisements to make it display blockings the recognition of which part of the site advertising is to make it difficult to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that there was a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blogpost, Adblock Ben Williams "spokesman wrote that" this kind of hin-and-fro battle between the clockwork open source community and the bunkers has been under way since the invention of display lockers, "and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has become involved in the struggle is a strong indication of how alarming display blockers have become the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a study conducted by Pageair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use display blockers worldwide; almost four times as much in 2013.</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay down in the dark 'in an act of desperation' on the road and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was probably habitable according to projections of a new NASA client model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have engendered Earth-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and nevertheless slowly reversed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus is exposed to its day-side of the sun almost two months," explained scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution suspected by planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although once believed to be inhabitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogene, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the constellation Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the constellation rotate to different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods are associated with planetary development.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The constellation of the Pleiades is 445 light years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this constellation, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now the fastest ones.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates these maturing stars expel large amounts of star winches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds drive through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star tortures, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- such as sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, taking larger stars slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the Pleiades" ballet, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars, "Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the constellation of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the constellation of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still much ahead of us, which we would like to know more about how the How, When and Why Stars will slow down their rotational rates and hang their "dance shoes" so to speak.</seg>

<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will in future act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.</seg>

<seg id="4">A learned athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese floats Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle skier Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Destinsky have been positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the beginning of the already critical field of athletics competitions, these news come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already proven last Sunday which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International sports court CAS confirmed the exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m Butterfly, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have taken part in the courses over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association considers the matter" "" "very serious and demands full co-operation with the investigations" "", "cited Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Court of Justice CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC, but the CAS, is responsible for the sanctioning of the athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news seeps through the positive rehearsal at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on to the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "this was an incredible shock," "" "she said to Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," said the female athlete.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is alleged that the blood doping agent EPO will act in the forbidden substance.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the time being Danekova has been suspended, according to the BNT, the B-rehearsal should have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov received criticism immediately with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation may not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "on Friday the fall" "" "Adrian Destinsky" "" "was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny taking, however, both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the track starts, Danekova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Association IAAF was not allowed to start the entire Russian team except for systematic doping, while also the country nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, the previous offences in China also ensured fierce debates between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion, Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "if I see the podium more than 200 m freestyle, I want to hand over myself," "" "said Lacourt in French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focus of a discussion with Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2014, Sun had a positive test on the stimulant trimethazione in Chinese championships, but only had to sit down for a three-month ban.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide grouting hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Developers of blackmailing malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware protection specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, in part several times victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ransomware squeezing.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of malwarebytes, the offenders specify their blackmail software to react to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to blackout ransom is much higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was scary quickly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the victim's computer, it searches specifically for recently changed files, such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as to archive images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turn code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, firms deal with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher if a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German firms affected sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the business operation completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks whose patients could be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers at F-Secure have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims per chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies need to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware extortion, the hackers become more professional and share the work, explained safety expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits have been created by installing malware, consulting and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the scope of supply includes a matching tool so that minor configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "Wisniewski says." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers are looking for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the boards underground, buys the set of a criminal and arranges another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "the criminals normally use spammers with dissemination," "" "said Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now well-known among many companies that better safeguard their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel Ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful exhaustion alone, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators will also be able to take on completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators are blocking an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and the versatility of a mini van.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not work closely at any location.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top is slightly down there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage compartment.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "there is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l with raised and 1026 l with inverted backrests, but there is the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical when it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a chin chair and offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">But he should do a bit more quietly with his work.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">Driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant" "" "Executive" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the city emergency brake assist (operates at speeds of 32), the collision warning system and the lane departure assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "during manoeuvring." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote lighting assistant is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent slider responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine starting from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">It strolls regularly on the surrounding road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But that is to change: the right of law shall be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in traffic jams when driving over the motorway via Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16-17 August), the road construction is extended by 700 meters in the area between Hammer Road and Weser Straße.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then go directly from the Hammer Road to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage is that the traffic is split in an early stage so that the overall schedule is improved on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district council of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder annoys drivers, especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the backlog spends up to the bridge across the Alberslog path and sometimes even beyond.</seg>

<seg id="12">From here, the traffic is only diverted on the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be dismantled well over three quarters of a century.</seg>

<seg id="15">As long as this bottleneck and the associated traffic jam will continue, the responsible regional company cannot say.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it has to be reckoned with years: the bridge has an official remainder of the remaining period until 2034.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing Night: tips On Sleep Disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one walks around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep in the morning before the alarm-ringing.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and various causes can ruin them, emphasises Hans-Günter neither eß, member of the board of the German society for sleep disappointment and sleeping medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand for the time being is the insomnia, i.e. an intrusion and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially the sleeping feel many people feel inadequate or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member of the German House Medical Association with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently is sleep disorder an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is especially frequent in a depression," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can sleep badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to salute you about everyday problems and worries.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disorders become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, be advised.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look very different: tired, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or even drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any sleeping physician there in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, one should first turn to the family doctor in case of sleeping problems, advised the Dead Agent.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be investigated with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleep laboratory and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the study in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, with snoring with breathing replacements, in case of daytime fatigue, for sleep transducers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not really necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "only do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After cloning, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose eyewear, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera stands on the ceiling of the sleeping-ends.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few adjusting screws on which you can set for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Shoot counts: regular bed- and downtime, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not good at all.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few Linden trees, a remnant of cobblestones in between: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a fresco-painted kindergarten and a bike path.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone has sprayed" "" "ugly!" "" "on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, in the meantime the inhabitants have rental contracts, on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Insenator Henkel devoted a number of times for a hard action by the police against the project, calling the area as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the premises on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, patrolling the police on site for three weeks, closed off parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers removed from the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents go for walks with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others converse vorm Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and nursery schools.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are above all annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the care of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, which mostly wanted police protection from the vandalient left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police make up between landowners and their neighbors, obviously does not exist." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood, which also today has a low average income compared to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Residential buildings and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainz was evacuated under large police regulations in a real road battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and partly still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and polls from all over the world over the past few years: people from the GDR times and former occupants are now sharing their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them at molded panes or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with color-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year together with the words "left autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like body injury show statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the criminal offences tend to make damage that tends to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">Insecurity cannot be mentioned for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who have not been that.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars have no longer existed in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately moved to the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important to her that local residents got their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all of a sudden claimed the sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former building gaps that crowd the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many - here they live rather people who are not so well contaminated," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">Frustration is on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for drawn-out genes that annoy about color bombs: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw near should be aware of this - just like someone who pulls in a pub neighborhood, can complain poorly about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is New Refugee Representative</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management team for Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact person for all stakeholders: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here, the boring wool milksow, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less ridiculing than rather on the multitude of demanding tasks- meant, meant when the administration wanted to write out the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, weaving a hilarious woollen mill.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it's about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "said Regine client, that Annika Deuschle supports honourable and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the councils to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It doesn't work so far, if you depend on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings have to be intimidated as it is called beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is not only with apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro job and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be fathomed or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive outside effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">This means that administration and volunteers are also involved here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is important that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must explain to the refugees that it will take and they can make sense of time, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach can't work and be unprofitable, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems as well, "said customer honestly," people with nothing at all. "therefore the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do they fear radicalisation after the latest incidents, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine client says clearly," "" "what some may call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They are afraid that the assassins will completely revoke them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "said Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Therefore, the main and honorary officials have to look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "in the process, they always have in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach." ""</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, the politics abhor.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher has already been utilised to integrate the existing human beings in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
